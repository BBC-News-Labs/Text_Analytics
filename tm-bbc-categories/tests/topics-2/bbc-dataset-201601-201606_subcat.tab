The team at University of California, Berkeley's Human Engineering and Robotics Lab recognised that many people were unable to afford access to exoskeletons for physiotherapy.  They began designing an exoskeleton with a pared-down profile and comparatively cheap cost of $40,000 (£27,000).  "The first week that I used this suit, my parents came and I was able to hug them, the first time in I don't even know how long," said Mr Steven Sanchez who has been testing the suit for the last three years.  The creators of the suit emphasise it is not going to replace wheelchairs for its users at present, but it could be a critical tool in physiotherapy sessions and allowing people with paralysis to experience the sensation of walking.

Hosted on the StarCon.net.kp address in North Korea it had many of the features of other social networks.  It is not clear who created StarCon but it is thought to be a test project for a future service to be offered by the nation's telecoms operator.  Soon after being discovered, the site was hacked and it is now not accessible.  The site was spotted by Doug Madory, a researcher at network management firm Dyn, who said it was rare to see any websites hosted in the secretive nation. The site's name suggested it was linked to North Korea's Star telecom service, he said.  StarCon was built around a commercial software package called phpDolphin and had many of the features, including newsfeeds, messaging systems and personal spaces, seen on other social sites. However, many of the site's pages were unfinished and were filled with placeholder text.  "I don't believe it was intended to be accessible from outside North Korea," Mr Madory told the BBC.  However, he said, Dyn's mention of StarCon on its Twitter feed led people to set up personal pages on the site and start using it to swap messages.  One of the first accounts created parodied North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Outsiders created about 300 accounts on StarCon during its brief existence.  "There were a lot of people signing up that, based on their comments, appeared to genuinely think they could reach the North Korean people through the website," he said.  "I'm quite sure that no North Koreans ever really used it for a social network website despite the fact that it was hosted in North Korea."  A day after being discovered, the site was hacked to re-direct every visitor to a YouTube video. Soon after, it went offline completely.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416222	Iran closes borders on messaging apps	Instant messaging apps must store data about Iranian users inside the country, Iran has ordered.  The new rule comes from Iran's Supreme Council of Cyberspace and firms have been given one year to comply.  Campaign group Privacy International described it as "extremely worrying" but said it could prove difficult to enforce.  Iran's most popular messaging app is Berlin-based service Telegram, believed to be used by one in four Iranians.  Messages shared via Telegram, which is free to use, are encrypted and can be seen by many users at once.  Telegram could not be reached for comment but reports circulating on social networks that it has decided to comply are understood to be false.  Most social networks are officially blocked by the state but lots of people are able to access them via services like Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), which mask a browser's geographical location.  The country's president, Hassan Rouhani, has active Twitter accounts in English and Persian.  In my view, Telegram has a tough job ahead of it when deciding whether to go ahead with what the government wants.  People are worried about losing it but they are also saying they will stop using it if the firm complies with the new law.  This is a big thing for people in Iran. They are very sensitive about security.  If Telegram does what is asked, then the government will have control over the content, it can monitor who is saying what, and it can arrest people.  The app was shut down briefly last year for refusing to comply with the government - and that added to its popularity.  Just recently BBC Persian covered a story about high school students protesting about their exams - they created a Telegram group to mobilise and inform other students about the protest.  The group got 20,000 subscribers and the protest went well. But as soon as it got media coverage the government told the group administrators to close it down.  In a short time, the number of subscribers came down to just 300.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36416967	Web firms pledge to tackle online hate speech	Microsoft, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook have pledged to remove hate speech within 24 hours, in support of a code of conduct drafted by the EU.  The freshly drafted code aims to limit the viral spread of online abuse on social media.  It requires the firms to act quickly when told about hate speech and to do more to help combat illegal and xenophobic content.  The firms must also help "educate" users about acceptable behaviour.  The need for better ways to combat online hate speech had become more urgent in the wake of terror attacks in Belgium, said Vera Jourova, European Commissioner for Justice.  "Social media is unfortunately one of the tools that terrorist groups use to radicalise young people and racists use to spread violence and hatred," she said in a statement.  Hate speech and xenophobia also had a "chilling effect" on groups that sought to champion tolerance and non-discrimination, she said.  The agreement of the four web firms was an "important step forward" in making sure the net stayed a place where free expression was possible, Ms Jourova said.  A core part of the code is the requirement to remove hateful content within 24 hours of being properly notified about it.  The tech giants have also agreed to work more closely with groups that monitor and flag violent and hateful content. They will also develop and promote "counter narratives" to challenge those who post hate speech or illegal content.  Karen White, Twitter's head of public policy for Europe, said "hateful conduct" had no place on its network and added there was a "clear distinction between freedom of expression and conduct that incites violence and hate".  The code also requires the four firms to overhaul their notification systems to ensure people can quickly report inflammatory content when they find it.  The Commission will hold regular meetings with technology firms to monitor what effect the code of conduct is having. A preliminary assessment of its effectiveness will be drawn up for the Commission's high level group on combating racism and xenophobia by the end of 2016.  The code of conduct for net firms was one of several initiatives to tackle abuse online, the Commission said. Other work involves research to help ISPs assess information posted online and produce tools that can counter intolerance.	tech

In both cases, the logins appear to have been stolen several years ago but only recently came to light.  The incident comes the same month it emerged that a four-year-old database containing more than 167 million LinkedIn IDs had been traded online.  One expert said it was "intriguing" all had emerged in such a short period.  Security researcher Troy Hunt also said millions of IDs from adult dating site Fling - which had been breached in 2011 - had been offered on a hacking forum at the start of the month.  "There's been some catalyst that has brought these breaches to light and to see them all fit this mould and appear in such a short period of time, I can't help but wonder if they're perhaps related," he blogged.  "Even if these events don't all correlate to the same source and we're merely looking at coincidental timing of releases, how many more are there in the 'mega' category that are simply sitting there in the clutches of various unknown parties?"  Of the two most recent leaks, MySpace is potentially more serious.  The touted list contains details for 360.2 million accounts, including email addresses and up to two linked passwords.  The passwords were stored in a modified form that was meant to protect them, but the technique used was relatively weak and it seems the vast majority have been cracked.  News site Motherboard has been in contact with one of the sites selling access to the list. It said of the five accounts it tested, all yielded the real passwords, suggesting the leak was real.  "We have invalidated all user passwords for the affected accounts created prior to June 11, 2013 on the old MySpace platform," the social network said in a statement.  "MySpace is also using automated tools to attempt to identify and block any suspicious activity that might occur on MySpace accounts.  "We have also reported the incident to law enforcement authorities and are cooperating to investigate and pursue this criminal act."  Despite the age of logins and decline in use of the social network, expert Mr Hunt said some users should still be concerned.  "It all comes back to whether they've been following good password practices or not," he told the BBC.  "If they've reused passwords across multiple services - and remember, these breaches date back several years so they need to recall their practices back then - then they may well have other accounts at risk too."  The Tumblr IDs come from a breach flagged by the Yahoo-owned blogging site on 12 May.  At the time it referred to the leak as a "set of Tumblr user email addresses with salted and hashed passwords from early 2013".  Mr Hunt's analysis indicates that more than 65 million accounts were affected, making it one of the largest data dumps of its kind.  The reference to "salted" means that the firm added random characters to the passwords before converting them into a string of digits and recording them to a database.  This makes it much harder to expose them.  Motherboard reported that a hacker, nicknamed Peace, had said the Tumblr dump amounted to "just a list of emails", and so was advertising it at a lower price than the MySpace and LinkedIn logins also offered for sale.  However, the addresses could still be useful to scammers as a basis for a phishing attack.  Mr Hunt's Have I Been Pwned site already provides a free way to check whether people's Tumblr, Fling or LinkedIn IDs are among those contained in the data dump.  The security researcher said he was also in the process of "finalising the load" to make it possible to search for affected MySpace accounts as well.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36414264	Data watchdog rejects EU-US Privacy Shield pact	The European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS) has said a data transfer pact between the EU and US needs "significant improvements".  The EU-US Privacy Shield agreement was supposed to safeguard EU citizens' personal information when stored in the US.  The agreement was designed to replace the Safe Harbour pact, which the EU Court of Justice ruled invalid in 2015.  But the EDPS Giovanni Buttarelli warned Privacy Shield was "not robust enough".  "I appreciate the efforts made to develop a solution to replace Safe Harbour but the Privacy Shield as it stands is not robust enough to withstand future legal scrutiny," he wrote in a statement.  Mr Buttarelli's statement does not mean the agreement will be scrapped, but his concerns echo those expressed by European privacy regulators in April.  The Privacy Shield agreement, negotiated by the US and the European Commission, was intended to be ratified in June.  Safe Harbour referred to an agreement struck between the European Union and United States, designed to provide a "streamlined and cost-effective" way for US firms to get data from Europe without breaking EU rules. It was introduced in 2000.  The EU forbids personal data from being transferred to and processed in parts of the world that do not provide "adequate" privacy protections.  Safe Harbour allowed US companies to self-certify that they had taken the necessary steps to protect data, to avoid having to seek permission for each new type of transfer.  In 2013, Edward Snowden revealed details about a surveillance scheme operated by the NSA called Prism.  It was alleged the agency had gained access to data about Europeans and other foreign citizens stored by the US tech giants.  Privacy campaigner Max Schrems asked the Irish Data Protection Commission to audit what material Facebook might be passing on. The watchdog declined saying the transfers were covered by Safe Harbour.  When Mr Schrems contested the decision, the matter was referred to the European Court of Justice, which ruled Safe Harbour inadequate.  In February 2016, the EU and US agreed a new pact to make it easy for organisations to transfer data across the Atlantic.  Key points of the agreement are:  However, the agreement has been criticised by European privacy watchdogs.  In April, the Article 29 Data Protection Working Party said it was still concerned about the possibility of "massive and indiscriminate" bulk collection of EU citizens' data by the US authorities.  "Significant improvements are needed... to respect the essence of key data protection principles," he wrote.  In a statement, the EDPS said the Privacy Shield agreement needed to provide "adequate protection against indiscriminate surveillance" and "obligations on oversight, transparency, redress and data protection rights".	tech

A UKIP MEP complained about the pictorial instructions on how to vote, which show a pencil hovering over the Remain box.  The election watchdog said the graphic "shouldn't have been used".  Bristol City Council said it would amend the form and insisted it was not trying to influence the vote.  Follow the latest developments on our live page  Mike Hookem, a UKIP MEP for Yorkshire and the Humber, said a constituent of his had been alerted to the Bristol area postal voting packs.  "Any ballot papers which have gone out with marks showing either remain or leave boxes being ticked in the example need to be recalled and the person responsible needs to be investigated" Mr Hookem said.  "It may be an isolated incident around Bristol but in the interests of democracy we cannot take that risk."  The Leave.EU campaign tweeted images of the postal ballot instructions and called on supporters to tell them if they had received the packs.  A spokeswoman for the Electoral Commission said: "While it is unlikely that postal voters in Bristol might be persuaded to vote a different way because of the graphic in these instructions, clearly it shouldn't have been used.  "We are following up with the counting officer for Bristol City to ensure that it is amended before any further postal voting packs are issued to voters in the area."  A Bristol City Council spokesperson said: "This form is designed to explain the logistics of voting by post and not to suggest how someone should vote.  "The placement of the pen graphic was entirely incidental and we do not believe that anybody could reasonably be influenced by such a graphic.  "However, given current sensitivities, for all future postal vote dispatches the form and graphic will be amended."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36412487	Australia to sell £8m of seized bitcoins	A collection of bitcoins worth about £8m, which had been confiscated by police in Australia, will be auctioned off in June.  The 24,518 bitcoins will be sold mostly in blocks of 2,000 - each with a value of about £680,000.  Ernst & Young, the firm organising the auction, said the bitcoins had been "confiscated as proceeds of crime" but did not elaborate on the case.  One expert said the authorities had chosen a "safe" time to sell.  Australian newspapers have previously reported that 24,500 bitcoins were seized by police in the state of Victoria in 2013, after a man was arrested for dealing illegal drugs online.  In 2015, Victoria's Asset Confiscation Operations department "confirmed it had recently taken possession of 24,500 coins and would try to make the most of it", according to the Sydney Morning Herald.  "This is a significant amount of Bitcoin," Dr Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told the BBC. "It's about a week's worth of new Bitcoin that comes onto the market through mining."  Currently about 4,000 new bitcoins are generated a day as a reward for "miners" who offer their computer power to process Bitcoin transactions.  "Generally the view is that any time 10,000 bitcoins sell, the market price can be moved significantly."  The price of bitcoin rose to $530 (£362) on Friday, its highest level since August 2014.  Dr Hileman said the Australian authorities had chosen a "safe" time to sell because there is some uncertainty about what will happen to the value of Bitcoin in July.  "The Bitcoin protocol is designed to reduce the number of new bitcoins miners are given as a reward for processing transactions every four years.  "The reward will be halved on 14 July, so prices could go up due to the reduced supply of new bitcoins.  "But there is a question about whether security could decline, if rewards for miners are reduced significantly. So it's a safe time to sell, as there is no guarantee about what might happen in July."  The Australian Bitcoin auction, which will be open to bidders worldwide, is the first such sale outside of the US.  In 2014, the US Marshals Service began auctioning a collection of about 175,000 bitcoins that had been confiscated from the founder of internet marketplace Silk Road.  The final auction of those bitcoins attracted 11 bidders, possibly due to the high cost of each block on sale.  Dr Hileman said the sale of Bitcoin by the Australian authorities was an acknowledgement that the cryptocurrency was not illegal.  "Any time a government sells Bitcoin, it is acknowledging that this is a different asset to drugs, for example, that would not be sold in an auction," he told the BBC.  "That was one of the big takeaways from the US Marshal Service auction - they set a precedent that Bitcoin was not illegal.  "Australia has been going through its own regulatory process - and this makes a standing that Bitcoin is legal to use in Australia."	tech

If no one manages that then there is a £50,000 prize for the person who gets the most consecutive games correct.  Vote Leave has taken out an insurance policy to fund the contest.  But Britain Stronger In Europe has described the contest as a "con" - with odds of winning 8 billion to one.  The £50m represents the amount Vote Leave says Britain sends to the EU a day, a claim disputed by its critics.  The argument that Britain sends £350m a week to the EU has proved controversial because it does not take into account the rebate that the UK gets on its payments to the EU.  A Vote Leave source said the football contest could be a "game changer" for the campaign because it would allow them to gather the contact details of thousands of potential voters, many of whom would not normally be interested in the referendum.  Anyone entering will have to rate themselves on a scale of one to five as to whether they are more likely to back continued membership of the EU.  The campaign admits that the chances of winning the top prize are slim - but says it is "worth a punt".  But Will Straw, executive director of Britain Stronger In Europe, said the long odds were the same as those for Vote Leave "coming up with a coherent vision for what life would look like outside the EU".  He added: "Once again Vote Leave put wild guesswork at the heart of their campaign and it is the British people who they are asking to take the risk."  Hosts France take on Romania in the first game of Euro 2016 on 10 June, with England and Wales in action the following day.  Vote Leave's campaign director Dominic Cummings said: "This is the chance of a lifetime - just imagine what you could do with the £50m we send to the EU every single day.  "We want everyone to have the chance to win the sort of money most people can only dream of, unless they are a banker or a Euro MP."  You are staggeringly unlikely to win this competition.  There are 36 games in the group stages of the tournament, when there could be a victory for either side or a draw.  Then there are 15 knockout games, which cannot be drawn.  The odds of picking all 51 games randomly are one in 5,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, which is a bit better than the odds of guessing the mobile phone numbers of the next two strangers you see in the street.  Now, your in-depth knowledge of European football may tip the odds more in your favour, but remember you also have to guess which teams will qualify from the group stages, which may go down to goal difference or even goals scored.  The competition is a based on a similar contest in the US, run by billionaire Warren Buffett, one of the world's richest men, involving the annual men's NCAA basketball tournament known as March Madness.  Vote Leave says the contest is free to enter and is open to anyone who is over the age of 18 who is registered to vote in the EU referendum.  Entrants must supply their telephone number, email address and home address to qualify for the prize.  Vote Leave's privacy policy allows anyone to "opt out" from receiving campaign information "at any time".  The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority has again rebuked Vote Leave over its £350m a week claim.  In a statement on the authority's website, Sir Andrew Dilnot said that he was "disappointed" that the campaign group continued to claim the full amount could be spent in the UK, saying it "undermined trust in official statistics".	politics

VirnetX was awarded $625m (£426m) in February after a jury found Apple had wilfully infringed four of its patents.  The Texas-based firm is now seeking further damages and says Apple should be blocked from using its technologies to power its video and text chat apps.  It wants the court to disregard the verdict because the US Patent and Trademark Office has invalidated VirnetX's claim to the inventions - an action that is itself being challenged in a case before the Supreme Court.  Apple has argued that its customers would be harmed if it were forced to stop offering Facetime and iMessage to iPhone, iPad and Mac owners.  But VirnetX claims the step is warranted as its own secure messaging and video conferencing app - Gabriel Collaboration Suite - is suffering as a consequence.  Some parts of the media have described VirnetX as being a "patent troll", but this term is normally reserved for firms that own inventions but never apply them to a product of their own.  The Gabriel app, however, is not well known.

MI6 and and GCHQ advertised on the Mumsnet website for the first time this year, and MI5 has raised its target for women employees to 45% by 2021.  Flexible working and the importance of "high emotional intelligence" are also being stressed in recruitment.  The agencies were responding to calls from MPs to recruit more women.  Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee reported in March 2015 that 37% of intelligence agency staff were women and women only make up 19% of senior civil servants in the agencies.  One year on, the government says that it and the agencies - internal security service MI5, external spy agency MI6 and the government listening post GCHQ - "agree wholeheartedly" with the need for "diversity" in agency staff.  It says action has been taken since the report was published to "increase their focus" on "all aspects of diversity", including recruiting more women.  Recruitment targets, "diversity champions", events such as a recent "Women in Cyber" event and more career support for female officers are part of efforts to employ more women and encourage talented existing women to apply for promotion.  They also say they are doing more to "promote a flexible working culture" for men and women with childcare commitments and to allow women returning from maternity leave to take up their old jobs - including in intelligence roles.  The three agencies also said they were always looking for "new and innovative ways to recruit those with the right skills, mind-set and diversity of approach".  MI5 had already used Mumsnet as well as local newspapers to target women "not currently in work" while the other two agencies did so for the first time this year.  GCHQ has also removed a requirement of a 2:1 university degree from its "fast-stream" recruitment to encourage women who had followed a "non-traditional graduate route".  The government said the initiatives were having an effect as MI5 had recently been placed in the Times Top 50 employers for women and had increased its number of new female employees by 5% to 46% of new recruits. GCHQ had seen applications from women rise to 40%. MI6 had increased its female recruitment targets for 2016/17 after seeing a 4% drop in women - to 41% of new recruits.  The government also said career support for female staff was having a "real impact" with increased numbers of women applying for senior roles in MI5.	politics

Chinese microblog site Weibo said users had now made more than 1.2 million posts complaining about Windows 10.  The complaints in China follow criticism from IT experts who said Microsoft was using a "nasty trick" to make people upgrade.  Microsoft has not yet responded to the reports about Chinese complaints.  "The company has abused its dominant market position and broken the market order for fair play," Zhao Zhanling, a legal adviser for the Internet Society of China told the official Xinhua news agency.  He said by forcing the upgrade, Microsoft had not respected the users' right to choose what they install on their computers. This was important, he said, because eventually Microsoft might profit from the "unwanted" upgrades.  One Chinese man, Yang Shuo, who works at a Beijing-based PR firm, said the Windows 10 update interrupted him while he was working on a business plan. This meant he had to abandon the document which led to a meeting about a deal worth 3m yuan (£312,000) being cancelled.  The outcry on Weibo has led Microsoft to post information on the site to help people revert to older versions of Windows.  Earlier this week, Microsoft faced widespread criticism about changes it made to the pop-up box that regularly appears to encourage people using Windows 7 and 8 to upgrade.  The box was changed so that closing the pop-up by clicking on the "x" in its top- right corner was taken as permission for the scheduled upgrade to start. Typically, clicking an "x" stops a pop-up taking any further action.  The pop-up design change had been described as a "nasty trick" by some commentators.  The outcry over the change forced Microsoft to issue an update to give people another chance to cancel the Windows 10 installation.  Around 300 million devices have been updated to run the new system, according to figures from Microsoft, who said the free offer to install Windows 10 will end on 26 July.	tech

More transparency is needed about the "complex" way decisions are made at the Council of the European Union, the European Scrutiny Committee said.  They want to gauge how much legislation "is simply nodded through" by ministers after talks between officials.  The government said it was "fully committed to high levels of transparency in EU decision-making".  A Foreign Office spokesman added: "That's why we pushed for and recently secured a greater role for national parliaments in scrutinising EU legislative proposals."  Along with the European Parliament, the Council of the EU is the organisation's main decision-making body.  In its report, the European Scrutiny Committee said the process for agreement at the Council was complex, could involve discussions by one of 150 working groups at the official level and at the ambassadorial level - Coreper - before being agreed by ministers.  It recognised that progress had been made in increasing the information available about the final outcome of negotiations between ministers.  But they said it was "still very unclear how those decisions are reached", with some having to be agreed by consensus after years of difficult discussions "mostly at official level".  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, told the committee that decision-making by consensus meant that the process was one of "trying to stop really bad things happening and damage reduction".  But one of his predecessors in the role, Labour's Dame Margaret Beckett, who backs the EU Remain campaign, told the committee that she had never agreed to a measure that she thought "on balance, was in any way against the interest of our country" and said Qualified Majority Voting had allowed the UK government to advance its interests.  Committee chairman Sir Bill Cash, a leading Eurosceptic, said: "UK citizens should be fully informed and given the facts as to how the 55% of EU laws which govern them are made.  "Many UK laws and measures include obligations derived from EU law. The bulk of decisions on such laws are made by officials and then nodded through by ministers.  "There is no information on how those decisions are reached, including who has had to compromise and at what price. Over 50% of decisions are agreed by consensus, which means policy differences can be invisible to the electorate."  The committee urged the government to "take action" to make more information available to the UK Parliament and to take a lead in the EU by "making public statements of the reason for its vote more frequently".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36397675	Three announces mobile ad-blocking trial	Mobile service provider Three has confirmed it will block advertising on its network for a day-long trial in June.  In February, the company said it wanted to give its customers "control, choice and greater transparency" over the adverts they received.  But the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) said Three's approach was too "broad" and would harm businesses.  The opt-in trial will take place on a day between 13 and 20 June.  Three said it was exploring ad-blocking on its network because:  In February, it announced a partnership with ad-blocking start-up Shine, in which Li Ka-shing, the owner of Three's parent company CK Hutchison, is an investor.  The mobile network said the technology would block 95% of pop-ups and adverts on websites, but the pre-roll video adverts, sponsored articles and in-feed promotions on social networks such as Twitter and Facebook would not be blocked.  Steve Chester from the IAB said encouraging advertisers to produce a "lighter, less invasive ad experience" was preferable to ad-blocking.  "We're all committed to solving the ad-blocking issue but disagree with Three's approach that network-level ad-blocking is the way to go," he said.  "It's a broad-brush approach that the largest media owners can probably survive but not the smaller ones.  "In the long-term consumers will also lose out, as they'll most likely have to pay for services that are currently free because they're supported by advertising."  Many people already choose to block adverts online by downloading browser plug-ins or mobile apps that can strip promotional content off websites.  Ad-blocking at a network level could reduce mobile data use by customers, but could also let a mobile service provider decide who can advertise to its customers, or charge fees to "white list" advertisers.  Three told the BBC it was in the early stages of testing the technology and did not know whether it would charge customers for an ad-blocking service, but said it would not "white list" advertisers, were it to launch one.  The company said it would contact 500,000 of its customers to invite them to take part in the trial.	tech

Mark Collett and his girlfriend Eva Van Housen - who has a swastika tattoo - have been handing out Vote Leave leaflets and badges from an official-looking stall in Leeds city centre.  Mr Collett was chair of the BNP Youth Wing before the party expelled him.  Vote Leave said he was not part of their campaign and they had asked him to stop using their material.  Eva Van Housen posted a picture on Facebook on 8 May with a Vote Leave badge pinned on a top which revealed the swastika tattoo with the comment "had a really great time today with Mark doing a Vote Leave stall". She describes herself as a "white-national socialist" on Twitter.  Vote Leave is the officially designated campaign to get Britain out of the EU in 23 June's referendum.  A spokesman for the Yorkshire branch of the campaign said they had asked Mr Collett to stop campaigning with their materials on 8 May.  But on Facebook Van Housen posted on 15 May that the couple "did another really great Vote Leave stall today".  Mr Collett posted a photo last weekend of the couple at "another very successful Vote Leave stall this weekend with the help of some other veteran nationalists".  Vote Leave are looking into how the former senior BNP member managed to get hold of their campaign materials.  On his Facebook page, Mr Collett has called on other nationalists to campaign for Vote Leave posting "if you want to do your own stall contact Vote Leave and they will send you everything you need to get started".  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "Mark Collett and his associates are not part of our campaign.  "We are a volunteer organisation, but anyone who is or was in the past a BNP campaigner is asked not to campaign for us or to distribute Vote Leave material."  One Vote Leave organiser in Yorkshire said Mr Collett had signed up to the campaign using a fake email address under a different name. When they found out who he was, he was de-registered as a supporter.  But in the two weeks since that happened Mark Collett has continued campaigning with his girlfriend using Vote Leave materials outside shops in Leeds.  Ms Van Housen told BBC News she felt "very strongly about leaving the EU" and had obtained campaign materials from her local Vote Leave branch to set up a stall.  She added: "I have spoken to members of the public of all races, nationalities and sexual orientations, and we have had a very positive response from the public, they have greatly appreciated our campaigning work and we have truly made a difference.  "I have in no way brought my political views in to my Vote Leave campaign work. This is about leaving the EU and only that."  She said Vote Leave asked her to stop using their materials when they discovered that Mr Collett was a former member of the BNP.  "Vote Leave is a non-affiliated volunteer campaigning group, they have absolutely no right in telling me and my partner to discontinue the stalls," she told the BBC.  "Myself and my partner and any other nationalists will continue to hold Vote Leave stalls and leaflet up until the referendum. My political tattoos and beliefs are left out of my campaign work entirely."  Mr Collett has been contacted for a response but has yet to provide one.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36393483	EU referendum: Salmond predicts Scots poll in two years if UK backs Brexit	Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has said he would expect another referendum on Scottish independence within two years of a Brexit vote, in a BBC EU debate.  He said if Scotland was "dragged out" of the EU "against our will" on 23 June he believed there would be another vote - and it would be for independence.  But Conservative Liam Fox said the EU vote should not be "stoked by fear" of a second Scottish referendum.  Voters aged 18-to-29 took part in the BBC debate in Glasgow.  Ahead of the EU referendum on 23 June, the at-times feisty debate - entitled How Should I Vote? - also included Labour's Alan Johnson, who backs staying in the EU and UKIP's Diane James, who is campaigning for a Leave vote.  Former First Minister Mr Salmond told the audience a second Scottish independence referendum "would have to be within the two-year period of the UK negotiating to withdraw" from the EU, should it vote to leave.  He said: "If you had the situation where Scotland in four weeks' time votes Remain and the rest of the UK or England drags Scotland out by voting to leave then that would justify, in my opinion, another referendum."  It was lively. It was feisty. And that was just the audience.  The BBC referendum debate gathered together 18 to 29-year-olds from all over the UK to hear four panellists, the youngest of whom - 54-year-old Liam Fox - was a quarter of a century older than the oldest member of the audience.  But the most striking contribution came from 60-something Alex Salmond.  The former first minister of Scotland didn't just want to talk about this referendum, but the next one.  "In the circumstances of Scotland being threatened with being dragged out of the EU against our will, I think the result would be 'Yes' this time."  But Conservative MP Dr Fox accused Mr Salmond of "yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum".  Dr Fox said: "I have never been very sure what the SNP didn't understand about the result - the Scottish people voted to stay in the UK."  He said the EU referendum was "a decision that we take as the UK .. every vote counts. It's a decision for all the people in the UK and we should take it on the merits of the European Union debate and not be side tracked into yet another fear campaign about a Scottish referendum."  During a wide-ranging discussion, the audience criticised both campaigns for using the economy and immigration to "get the emotions ramped up".  Mr Salmond said he did not buy into some of the "scaremongering" material put out by the Treasury on the Remain side, adding: "It wouldn't be economic Apocalypse if we left the EU but there's more jobs and more chances if we stay in."  He said: "That's not the way to conduct referendum campaigns ... The remain campaign can't afford to lose 1% a month, otherwise they will lose. To win a campaign to motivate people you have got to argue a positive case."  Some of the young voters taking part criticised "tit-for-tat" attacks during the campaign, describing it as "petty name-calling" and saying it was no wonder people did not know which way to vote.  UKIP's Ms James did not accept that some in the Leave side's focus on immigration had been "appalling". She said there had been a focus on migration "on the basis that that's one very clear example that the UK government .. actually don't have control over a key aspect of our economy".  Other issues raised during the debate included travel, the NHS, house prices and jobs.  Asked whether travel across Europe would be affected by a vote to leave, the Conservative former defence secretary Mr Fox said: "Europe and exchange and trade and travel existed before there was a European Union and will continue after."  "Why do we have these arrangements? Because it is genuinely in the interests of both parties to do so."  But Labour's Mr Johnson said: "At the moment, we have a very beneficial system we can go anywhere within the EU, it's a two-way process ... There are 2.5m tourists who come to Scotland every year. How are you going to differentiate between the Polish plumber and the Polish tourist? It means surely, a system of visas."  He added: "Unless you put a border and watchtowers across the borders between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, you're going to have people coming across there because you're going to have an EU country and a non-EU country."  Asked whether visas would be required for European travel in the event of a Brexit vote, UKIP's Ms James said: "We just don't know". She said the PM should have identified that sort of detail already but had not published a "Plan B".	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36388265	Is there a place for old tech in the 21st Century?	It might have been the general consensus that the floppy disk, which was big in the 1980s, had had its day - but after the US government's revelation that the technology remains in use at the Pentagon, enthusiasts wonder whether there is still a place for old tech in today's hi-tech world?  I am a pilot, and I understand the role of new equipment allied with old stuff that, in my life at least, still has a role to play in life.  I have a Sharp VHS recorder purchased in 1999 in my drawing room, and an Aiwa hi-fi stack system, all still going strong.  I have cassettes from when I was a child in the 80s.  I am proud to say I still use video cassettes and vinyl, and have a huge record collection, supplemented by CDs to play in the car.  I get disillusioned with this throwaway society where once something is not fashionable anymore it's discarded.  I don't see why serviceable films on VHS from the 80s have to be digitally re-mastered, so that people must replace their video collection with DVDs.  Then, we have to do the same thing again with Blu-ray, and replaced again with downloads.  What I don't see is why I need to keep changing my collections because of marketers and society - it's nonsensical.  I bought my 1972 Akai 4000D player about a year ago from eBay and reconditioned it.  I'm an enthusiast and collect equipment like that.  You get 45 minutes on each reel, and it is very high-fidelity.  It still provides much (easy) listening pleasure.  I use the Apple Extended Keyboard II on my home computer as my main keyboard.  I write quite a bit for my day job and for pleasure, and I feel much more productive typing on a keyboard like this.  The only thing is that they are loud compared to more recent types; everybody in the house knows when I'm typing.  But that's a small price to pay for the pleasure of a mechanical keyboard.  Technological progress isn't always for the better, and our desire to have computers (and smartphones) as compact as possible has meant that keyboard design has suffered.  VHS player? Walkman?

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36389711	The long legacy of the floppy disk	The technology world may seem to be locked in an endless cycle of renewal - but not when it comes to the floppy disk.  More than 50 years after the technology was invented it has emerged that the US nuclear weapons force uses the disks in the 1970s computer system it still employs.  As it turns out the Pentagon is not alone in retaining an affection, sometimes born of technical necessity, for the humble disk. But why has it survived when so many other technologies have fallen by the wayside?  "They are just too useful," said Ian Rainsford, a spokesman for media firm Verbatim - one of several companies that still makes the disks.  In some industries, floppy disks are used in machines that sit on production lines and those chunks of industrial plants are unlikely to be shut down, changed or updated any time soon, he said.  "A lot of the industrial uses would be things like knitting or crocheting machines, CNC lathes and milling machines and precision cutters," he said.  "The machines driving production have remained the same and the company that developed the original equipment may well have gone out of business," he said.  "They certainly believe that if it isn't broke, don't fix it." he said.  What has changed is the volume of disks Verbatim now produces. It only turns out "thousands" of disks per month, he said, far less than the millions it cranked out in the mid-90s when the technology was ubiquitous.  But, he said, for the customers that do use them they are essential to keep that business going.  "The death of the floppy disk has been heralded many, many times," said Mr Rainsford. "I think once Microsoft started shipping Windows on CDs it was sounded for the first time and that was 21 years ago."  For Kevin Murrell, a director of The National Museum of Computing at Bletchley Park, it is no surprise that floppy disks, and the computers that use them, have stuck around.  "It's a good thing," he said. "It's a good, old proper technology that actually works and is proven.  "We regularly read floppy disks from 40 years ago and they are as good as new," he said.  "Magnetic tape has a real issue because when it is on the reels you have a lot of different layers so you have 'print through'," he said. "This involves the shadow of data on one section of tape being superimposed on the layer above and below. The interference means data quickly gets harder to read.  "We all thought that putting data on CDs would last for ever but that idea went out of the window a long time ago," he added.  And the history of technology is littered with short-lived storage systems, such as Jaz drives and zip drives, that are now obsolete.  By contrast, said Mr Murrell, a floppy is a much more reliable data storage format.  He added: "8in and 5-and-a-1/4in disks are usually a very safe bet."  The same can be said of the computer systems that still use them. More often than not, he said, those older computer systems are running some very sensitive and significant installations such as power stations or air traffic control systems.  These "safety critical" computer systems are built for purpose and would take a huge amount of time and effort to update. As a result, many stay in situ for decades.  An example of this was the Marconi TAC machine used to monitor the reactor at the Wylfa nuclear power station in Anglesey for 38 years. It used 8in disks and was turned off in 2004.  Old machines running computer code written decades ago sit behind the apps and websites of many modern services and sites, said Mr Murrell.  "Occasionally it comes out that software in banking systems is written in Cobol and is 30 years old, but it is still used because it is reliable and still works," he said.  "Would you rather have a system that is proven to work or a machine running Windows 10?" he asked.  James Bailey, a director at Hyperscale IT which helps firms find parts for old computer systems, said many organisations were running servers and software that was more than a decade old.  "It's a bit like running a vintage car, all the parts are out there in junkyards," he said. "It's just a question of finding them."  Hyperscale helps firms source power supplies, memory modules and other components to keep those ageing servers going to maintain the services they support.  Companies and other organisations stick with legacy kit because it works and because the time and money they can spend on coding and development is finite.  "If you decide to move that legacy to a new computer system you might miss the chance to innovate in another part of the business," he said.  Firms are often reluctant to spend money updating something that works because the end result will not progress the business.  "If you do update, then you'll end up in the same place at the end of all the work."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36387563	Researchers teach robots to 'feel pain'	Researchers from Germany are developing an artificial nervous system aimed at teaching robots how to feel pain.  As well as allowing robots to quickly respond to potential damage to their systems, it could also protect humans who are increasingly working alongside them.  The scientists plan to base the system on "insights from human pain research".  To test it, they fitted a robotic arm with a fingertip sensor that could detect pressure and temperature.  The researchers, from Leibniz University in Hannover, are developing a system that would allow a robot to "be able to detect and classify unforeseen physical states and disturbances, rate the potential damage they may cause to it and initiate appropriate countermeasures, ie reflexes", they explained.  Just as human neurons transmit pain, the artificial ones will pass on information that can be classified by the robot as either light, moderate or severe pain.  Researcher Johannes Kuehn told IEEE Spectrum: "Pain is a system that protects us. When we move away from the source of pain, it helps us not get hurt."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36380247	'50% of misogynistic tweets from women'	Half of all misogynistic tweets posted on Twitter come from women, a study suggests.  Over a three-week period, think tank Demos counted the number of uses of two particular words as indicators of misogyny.  It found evidence of large-scale misogyny, with 6,500 unique users targeted by 10,000 abusive tweets in the UK alone.  Twitter boss Jack Dorsey has said that tackling abuse is a priority.  The research comes as five UK MPs - Yvette Cooper, Maria Miller, Stella Creasy, Jo Swinson and Jess Phillips - launch their Reclaim the Internet campaign, in response to growing public concern about the impact of hate speech and abuse on social media.  The campaign has opened an online forum to discuss ways to make the internet less aggressive, sexist, racist and homophobic.  Launching the campaign, Ms Cooper told the BBC: "The truth is nobody knows what the best answers are. There is more when there is criminal abuse. for example rape threats, that the police should be doing but what is the responsibility of everyone else? What more should social media platforms be doing?"  She said that the campaign was an opportunity to "put forward their proposals and demands for the changes we want to see".  In response Twitter's head of trust and safety Kira O'Connor told the BBC: "Hateful conduct has no place on the Twitter platform and is a violation of our terms of service.  "In addition to our policies and user controls, such as block, mute and our new multiple tweet reporting functionality, we work with civil society leaders and academic experts to understand the challenge that exists."  The Demos study also looked at international tweets and found more than 200,000 aggressive tweets using the words, "slut" and "whore", were sent to 80,000 people over the same three weeks.  WHY IS ABUSE SO PREVALENT ONLINE?  The commonsense approach to posting comments on social networks would be to never say anything online that you wouldn't say to someone's face but that simple rule seems to be regularly ignored.  Being able to post anonymously helps and, in many ways, social networks have become the modern day equivalent of a natter over the garden fence or a gathering on the village green - but on a global scale.  And just as in the old gossip circles of old, there will be people whose comments are meaner or more aggressive than the rest, so that is amplified online. And now the voices of the trolls can be heard and they can pick victims - generally people they don't know - pretty much at random.  Abuse on social networks is not new and neither is the revelation that women contribute to the problem.  A 2014 study from cosmetics firm Dove found that over five million negative tweets were posted about beauty and body image. Four out of five were sent by women.  The bigger question is what can be done about it?  We have seen in recent years the police take the issue much more seriously and trolls have faced lengthy prison sentences. Some have made public apologies to their victims.  Education will be key. Teaching youngsters who haven't yet joined social media platforms that politeness is not a dying art and that if you say hurtful things online, they could genuinely cause distress, may give the next generation pause for thought before they start typing.  Demos used algorithms to distinguish between tweets being used in explicitly aggressive ways and those that were more conversational in tone.  Researcher Alex Krasodomski-Jones said: "This study provides a birds-eye snapshot of what is ultimately a very personal and often traumatic experience for women.  "While we have focused on Twitter, who are considerably more generous in sharing their data with researchers like us, it's important to note that misogyny is prevalent across all social media, and we must make sure that the other big tech companies are also involved in discussions around education and developing solutions."  She added that it was not about "policing the internet" but was more "a stark reminder that we are frequently not as good citizens online as we are offline".  Thousands have responded to the hashtag #ReclaimtheInternet, with many congratulating the female MPs for starting the campaign.  Others though questioned how effective the campaign would be, with some questioning whether it would damage free speech.  Have you experienced abuse on Twitter?

Downing Street said the Amstrad founder would be touring the country, championing enterprise and encouraging firms to take on more apprentices.  Last year he said he was quitting Labour because of his "disillusionment" with the party.  The businessman said he was "delighted" at his latest appointment, adding that "not enough of our young people know about apprenticeships and what they offer, and too few feel empowered to set up their own business".  Skills Minister Nick Boles said Lord Sugar had "huge credibility among young people".  In an interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme, Lord Sugar claimed former mayor of London Boris Johnson had gone "off the rails" in his criticisms of the European Union in recent weeks.  "These people that are advocating exit, with all due respect to them…some of them are politicians, and there's an ex-mayor who has gone off the rails at the moment, I had a lot of respect for him until a couple of weeks ago with some of the outlandish things he has been saying."  Despite being a strong supporter of the UK remaining in the EU, Lord Sugar said David Cameron and other pro-EU ministers needed to substantiate the claims they were making about the economic damage that a vote to leave would do.  "I said to the prime minister the other day you have a whole host of people giving you a load of statistics which you are rattling off.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36378087	Xiaomi Mi Drone poses price challenge to DJI	Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi has announced its first drone, pricing it significantly lower than a comparable model by the market leader DJI.  The Mi Drone can stay airborne for nearly half an hour and will be sold with a choice of stabilised cameras.  The move gives Xiaomi the chance to target a fast-growing market, at a time when it has failed to meet its own sales targets.  One expert said the firm now had to win over potential buyers' trust.  "The feature set between the Mi Drone and DJI's Phantom 3 is almost identical - they can both be made to return home and circle around a point of interest - but Xiaomi's product is so competitively priced you have to wonder if it can make much profit," Engadget's Chinese editor-in-chief Richard Lai told the BBC.  "So, the new drone will probably appeal to beginners. But experienced fliers want reliability and a brand with experience, and DJI has spent years refining its technology.  "It will take Xiaomi some time to prove itself as we still don't know how reliable its drones are, the quality of its video footage or how well its software will work."  Xiaomi plans to sell the Mi Drone with a 1080p high-definition camera with a 1km (0.6 miles) range for 2,499 yuan (£260), and a version with a higher-resolution 4K camera and 2km range for 2,999 yuan (£310).  By contrast, DJI sells the Phantom 3 4K with a range of 1.2km for 4,999 yuan (£520) in China.  Company executive Hugo Barra said that drones were "typically a product for rich people", but that the company wanted to target them at a wider audience.  Xiaomi is pitching its four-propeller aircraft at consumers wanting to take aerial photos and videos.  Mr Barra said the built-in gimbal stabilised the Sony-made camera sensor at "up to 2,000 vibrations per second", which he said was enough to avoid blur.  He added that it could stay airborne for up to 27 minutes using a 5,100 mAh battery.  That represents an extra two minutes of flight versus the Phantom 3, although DJI's more expensive Phantom 4 can stay aloft for 28 minutes and go further.  Although the Mi Drone will be sold under Xiaomi's brand, it was actually designed by Guangzhou Feimi Electronic Technology - a start-up that Xiaomi helped fund in 2014.  The company said it would start testing the product via an "open beta programme" involving the public in July, but has not said when the final product will go on sale, or whether it will be offered outside of China.  Xiaomi originally gave itself a sales target of 100 million smartphones for 2015, but managed to sell 71 million.  Figures for the first three months of 2016 indicate that it has recently been overtaken by two other Chinese phone manufacturers, Oppo and Vivo.  "Xiaomi's core smartphone growth is slowing, so the company is expanding into new growth markets as diverse as fitness bands, rice cookers and now drones," commented Neil Mawston from the consultancy Strategy Analytics.  However, he added, the global market for consumer drones would probably be limited to seven million units in 2016, meaning it was unlikely to become a big business for the firm in the near-future.  "I think there's probably a limited use for most people having a drone in their daily life," said another analyst, Tom Morrod from IHS Technology.  "They certainly are never going to match the smartphone sector, but they do have the potential to scale to something like DSLR camera sales.  "There are a lot of potential commercial applications for drones once regulators approve them.  "So, maybe there's a longer-term play here. When Amazon, DHL and other package delivery firms start deploying drones they might come and buy them from Xiaomi."  For its part, DJI said it welcomed the challenge.  "More competition will spur every company in this industry to improve its technology, and DJI will continue to strive to be the market leader," said a spokeswoman.	tech

The firm also said it would post a $950m (£646m) writedown, part of which is to cover redundancy payments.  A union official suggested the firm had cancelled plans to manufacture further handsets of its own, although this has not been confirmed.  The move comes just two years after the US company paid $7.2bn for Nokia's handset business.  Last week, a study indicated Windows-powered handsets accounted for less than 1% of global smartphone sales over the first three months of the year.  Microsoft is also in the process of selling its Nokia-branded feature phones business.  Microsoft said up to 1,350 of the job cuts would be made in Finland as a result of the latest announcement.  "My understanding is that Windows 10 will go on as an operating system, but there will be no more phones made by Microsoft," said a union representative.  A statement issued by Microsoft's chief executive did not make clear if this was indeed the case.  "We will continue to innovate across devices and on our cloud services across all mobile platforms," said Satya Nadella.  The company has promised to provide more information when it posts an earnings update in July.  But one expert said he still believed it still had plans for new handsets.  "The writing has been on the wall for some time about Microsoft's remaining smartphone operations in Finland," said Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.  "But Nadella's vision for Windows 10 is predicated on delivering the operating system to any screen, whether its a watch, a giant TV or a phone.  "So, Microsoft will continue to support smartphone licensees - including Alcatel, Acer and HP - for as long as it can.  "And I think we will eventually see a Surface-branded phone emerge as well.  "But that will be so Microsoft can show what the art-of-the-possible is for business-targeted devices - similar to what it has done with its Surface tablets and laptop - rather than trying to sell tens of millions of units itself to consumers."	tech

One factory has "reduced employee strength from 110,000 to 50,000 thanks to the introduction of robots", a government official told the South China Morning Post.  Xu Yulian, head of publicity for the Kunshan region, added: "More companies are likely to follow suit."  Since September 2014, 505 factories across Dongguan, in the Guangdong province, have invested 4.2bn yuan (£430m) in robots, aiming to replace thousands of workers.  Kunshan, Jiangsu province, is a manufacturing hub for the electronics industry.  Economists have issued dire warnings about how automation will affect the job market, with one report, from consultants Deloitte in partnership with Oxford University, suggesting that 35% of jobs were at risk over the next 20 years.  Former McDonald's chief executive Ed Rensi recently told the US's Fox Business programme a minimum-wage increase to $15 an hour would make companies consider robot workers.  "It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who is inefficient, making $15 an hour bagging French fries," he said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36378078	Netflix and Amazon face quota on EU-made content	On-demand video streaming services face a call that at least 20% of the catalogues they offer to EU subscribers should be made locally.  The European Commission has also proposed that the programming must be given "good visibility".  The move would affect US-based services including Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.  However, one expert suggested the new rules might not have as much impact as intended.  The call is part of a proposed update to the 28-nation bloc's Audiovisual Media Services directive.  One industry watcher said that many of the online platforms already meet the proposed quota requirement because they carry so much BBC-made material.  But even if the UK leaves the EU, and the BBC programmes no longer count, it would not necessarily mean lots of additional content from other countries being commissioned as a result.  "This is driven by the core problem that the EU identified 40 years ago, that the Hollywood studios and other US producers dominate global box office and broadcasting because they have scale that cannot be achieved in a fragmented EU," commented Alice Enders from the media consultancy Enders Analysis.  "It does send out an important signal to Netflix and others.  "But let's face it, the online services could meet the 20% quota by loading up themselves with lots of rubbish French, Italian, Spanish and whatever content.  "Or they could simply remove some of their lesser-watched non-EU material."  EU rules already oblige TV broadcasters to invest about 20% of their revenues into making or commissioning original content, and to spend at least 50% of their time showing European works, including material made in their own country.  But since audiences are spending increasing amounts of their time watching on-demand services, the EU civil service thinks the new measure is required.  "This will have a positive impact on cultural diversity and bring more opportunities for European creators," it says.  On-demand platforms would have to ensure at least a 20% of the catalogue they offered to EU subscribers be made up of "European works" and that this content be given prominence on viewers' screens.  This would not be enforced centrally from Brussels.  Rather, individual countries would have the right to demand the likes of Netflix and Amazon invest in local productions and/or buy the rights to EU-made shows and films.  It is suggested that the firms could either be given the option of either making the investments themselves or paying a levy into a fund that would then be shared out.  The European Commission acknowledges there could be a problem for smaller providers.  For example, it would be hard for Crunchyroll, a service that specialises in Japanese anime, or KorTV, which streams South Korean content, to meet the requirement.  As a result, it is proposed that a mandatory exception be made for companies with "a low turnover and low audiences as well as small and micro-enterprises".  The revised directive still needs to go before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers.  And even if it is adopted, local regulators would still have to enforce it.  Existing requirements affecting broadcasters are not always strictly adhered to.	tech

Users were angry that clicking the cross to dismiss the box meant that they had agreed to the upgrade.  Based on "customer feedback", Microsoft said it would add another notification that provided customers with "an additional opportunity for cancelling the upgrade".  The pop-up design had been described as a "nasty trick".  Microsoft told the BBC it had modified the pop-up as a result of criticism: "We've added another notification that confirms the time of the scheduled upgrade and provides the customer an additional opportunity for cancelling or rescheduling the upgrade.  "If the customer wishes to continue with their upgrade at the designated time, they can click 'OK' or close the notifications with no further action needed."  Senior editor at PC World magazine Brad Chacos, who describes himself as a fan of the Windows 10 operating system, had previously described the use of the cross to mean people had agreed to the upgrade as "a nasty trick".  Mr Chacos has been a vocal critic of what he described as the "heavy-handed tactics that Microsoft's been using to force people into the upgrade".  Previously, users had to press the cross to cancel the suggested upgrade, he pointed out.  Users have been telling the BBC about their own experience of unwanted upgrades, suggesting that the process is difficult to cancel once it has begun.  Havard Hughes' experience was typical of many.  "Windows 10 update ran on my PC despite all my efforts to stop it, including dismissing the update several times and frantically trying to abort the installation as it started when I was halfway through writing an important e-mail.  "My attempt to roll it back to Windows 7 resulted in the blue screen of death and a dead PC. I now have to reinstall my home computer from scratch because of this so-called 'free' upgrade.  "As someone who paid for my software and was perfectly happy with my fully functional Windows 7 machine, this has been an absolute disaster."	tech

The Chinese firm said it was pursuing its South Korean rival in two courts - one in California, the other in Shenzhen.  According to Huawei, several of its cellular communications and software inventions had been used in Samsung's phones without its permission.  Samsung told the BBC it would defend its business interests.  The specific patents involved have not been disclosed.  However, Huawei has said at least some of them are classed as Frand - an acronym referring to "fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory".  This means the Chinese company has committed itself to offering anyone a licence so long as they agree to a non-excessive compensation.  This kind of agreement is common in the tech sector as it makes it possible for different companies' products to communicate and share data formats with each other.  Huawei's intellectual property chief indicated it was seeking permission to use some of Samsung's technologies in return rather than seeking a payment.  "Thus far, we have signed cross-licensing agreements with dozens of our competitors," said Ding Jianxing.  "We hope Samsung will respect Huawei's R&D investment and patents, stop infringing our patents and get the necessary licence from Huawei, and work together with Huawei to jointly drive the industry forward."  A Samsung spokesperson responded in an email to the BBC saying "we will thoroughly review the complaint and take appropriate action to defend Samsung's business interests".  The action comes at a time when Oracle and Google are waiting for a jury to come back with a verdict in a copyright trial that has pitted the two giants against each other in the US.  But such clashes have become less common since Apple and Samsung's high-profile courtroom battle in 2011, which led to both firms revealing secrets about their inner workings and racking up large legal bills.  One expert noted that just because papers had been filed in the latest case did not mean Huawei and Samsung would necessarily fight a similar battle in public.  "Huawei may have initiated litigation as lever to get a settlement," commented Ilya Kazi from the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys.  "We don't know if it intends to go all the way through. Most cases do settle."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36371102	UK threatened by piecemeal devolution, warn peers	The future of the United Kingdom is being threatened by "piecemeal" devolution to England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, peers have said.  The cumulative impact that the transfer of powers was having on the "integrity" of the union had not been considered, the Lords Constitution Committee said.  Further granting of powers, it said, should be subject to an assessment of their effect on the UK's cohesion.  The SNP said the peers were "trundling out all the same old arguments".  The UK government has insisted the union is stronger as a result of the new settlement for Scotland, the proposed strengthening of the National Assembly for Wales and the Stormont Parliament in Northern Ireland and the Northern Powerhouse plan to empower Greater Manchester and other City regions by giving them responsibilities for health care, transport and planning.  But the cross-party committee has expressed reservations about the pace of devolution and the thinking behind it, arguing it has been "ad hoc and reactive" with too little thought given to the preservation and enhancement of the union.  Lord Lang, the Conservative peer and former Scottish secretary who heads the committee, said the union was "being taken for granted" and any further devolution must be governed by a new set of "constitutional principles" that safeguarded its integrity.  Under an agreement brokered in the aftermath of the No vote in the 2014 independence referendum, Holyrood is assuming substantial new powers over tax, including air passenger duty, borrowing and welfare as well as the right to legislate in a ream of new areas.  But the peers warned against Scotland taking any further steps towards "full fiscal autonomy", saying this would break the union apart. They also said the UK Parliament should scrutinise much more closely any future proposal for a second independence referendum.  While welcoming the more modest pace of devolution in England, the peers said the case for greater self-government for England remained "unresolved" and had clearly not been satisfied by either regional devolution deals or changes to voting procedures in the House of Commons giving MPs from English constituents a veto over legislation affecting England only.  "Since 1999, devolution has been largely demand-led and piecemeal," Lord Lang said. "The committee saw no evidence of strategic thinking about its cumulative impact on the union as a whole.  "The government does not seem to recognise the pressures being placed on the United Kingdom by the ad hoc, reactive manner in which devolution has taken place, and continues to take place. It's now time to focus more on the union."  Successive UK governments, he added, had "failed to adapt" to devolution and the sheer number of policy areas which were no longer the preserve of Whitehall, a state of affairs which required much closer collaboration if UK-wide policies were to be implemented properly.  As such, the devolved administrations must be regarded as "established components" of the UK's unwritten constitution.  "Instead of the 'devolve and forget' attitude of the past, the UK government should be engaging with the devolved administrations across the whole breadth of government policy," he said.  "Not interfering, but co-operating and actively managing the cross-border and UK-wide implications of differing policy and service delivery choices. Shared and overlapping policy areas need to be handled sensibly, with each administration conscious of the interests of the others."  The committee is made up of pro-Unionist Conservative, Labour and Lib Dem peers as well crossbenchers. The SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Northern Irish political parties are not represented.  The SNP said the report was "irrelevant" and questioned the right of unelected peers to pass judgement on Scotland's governing arrangements.  "This report indicates a spectacular failure of the committee to grasp devolution, and its recommendations would break the vow and promises made to the people of Scotland during the referendum campaign," said SNP MP Pete Wishart.  "The House of Lords seem to be confused that in the Fiscal Framework - agreed between the Scottish and UK Governments - it is crystal clear that the Barnett formula will remain."	politics

Clicking the red cross on the right hand corner of the pop-up box now activates the upgrade instead of closing the box.  And this has caused confusion as typically clicking a red cross closes a pop-up notification  The upgrade could still be cancelled, when the scheduled time for it to begin appeared, Microsoft said  The change occurred because the update is now labelled "recommended" and many people have their PCs configured to accept recommended updates for security reasons.  This means dismissing the box does not dismiss the update.  Brad Chacos, senior editor at the PC World website, described it as a "nasty trick".  "Deploying these dirty tricks only frustrates long-time Windows users who have very valid reasons to stick with operating systems they already know and love," he wrote.  Microsoft said: "With the free Windows 10 upgrade offer ending on 29 July, we want to help people upgrade to the best version of Windows.

But at an event in central London organised by the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics - a think tank which he helped to set up - he made it clear he would be unapologetic for his role in taking Britain to war in 2003.  He certainly hadn't drawn the lesson that western military intervention in the Middle East was counter-productive. He talked of a "generational struggle" against so-called Islamic State, saying "we are not being honest with our public if we are saying it is possible to defeat these people without making the commitment to defeat them and to do what it takes to defeat them".  For him, that was likely to require Western boots on the ground:  "You have got to defeat these people on the ground. The armed forces of America, the UK, France, other major countries have both experience and capability so even if we are using them in support of local forces, you have just got to decide what our objective is. Is our objective to defeat this enemy? My answer to that is yes.  "Do not be under any doubt at all - if you are going to defeat these people you are going to have to go and wage a proper ground war against them. The only question for us is if we are prepared to do that or not."  And he made no apology for toppling Saddam Hussein's dictatorship.  "There is a line today that's very common in western discourse, left and right, that says 'you know what, it would be better that these dictators stay in power'. I don't personally agree with it, but it doesn't matter if I agree with it or I don't - what the Arab Spring shows you is these countries with young populations, with radical forces operating within them, are not going to accept that...  "The answer is not have 20% of the population controlling the other 80% - that ain't going to work."  He drew his own lesson from the Iraq conflict, namely that it wasn't that it had been wrong to go to war but it was a lack of planning for the aftermath that had been at fault.  "We underestimated profoundly the forces that were at work in the region and would take advantage of the change once you topple the regime. The lesson is not complicated. It's simple."  So today we had a taster of how the former prime minister will take on the criticisms of him in Chilcot - criticisms he has seen but the wider public has not.  Like all other witnesses to the inquiry he won't see the full 6,000 pages until the day itself and will then face more searching questions about how the decision to go to war was taken.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36361896	Overwatch aimed for e-sports domination	World-of-Warcraft-maker Blizzard has released its first original gaming franchise in nearly two decades.  Overwatch - a first-person shooter - also marks the first time the studio has launched a title worldwide on PC and consoles simultaneously.  WoW is the second bestselling PC game of all time, but its subscriber numbers have halved since their peak in 2010.  Blizzard predicts strong sales of Overwatch and hopes it will attract large audiences as an e-sport.  The game is a departure from the developer's previous hits, in which players usually viewed the world from a god-like, third-person perspective.  Instead, players look directly down the barrel of their weapon as they roam a colourful world battling other gamers.  "Blizzard has a huge following on a global basis and is one of the best renowned publishers," said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games at the IHS Technology consultancy.  "But it has no pedigree in first-person shooters (FPS), so people will be excited to see what potential the game holds."  The game is also Blizzard's first new "intellectual property" in 18 years, since the studio has focused on spin-offs and expansions for existing franchises such as WoW, Diablo and Starcraft.  Subscribers to WoW have dropped from a high of 12 million in 2010 to 5.5 million in 2015, and the company has since stopped reporting the figures.  Thomas Tippl, chief operating officer at Activision Blizzard, said Overwatch would be "Blizzard's biggest launch since Diablo 3 in 2012" and hoped it would "resonate well in e-sports".  "E-sports is not only a driver of audience expansion, but also importantly drives growth in terms of time spent with our franchises," he said during an earnings call on 5 May.  If it captures the attention of e-sports competitors, it could have a very profitable future.  "Professional gaming competitions were watched online by roughly 200 million people in the past year, whilst over $200m (£138m) has been awarded in e-sports tournaments to date," said Dr Mark Johnson, a games researcher at the University of York.  "In recent years, Counterstrike has been the only highly successful FPS game with substantial longevity for professional gaming, so a game like Overwatch certainly has the potential to grab a huge new slice of this market.  "However, many FPS games have unsuccessfully tried to carve out a long-term sustainable place in e-sports, so it remains to be seen whether or not Overwatch has the right formula to knock Counterstrike off the pedestal."  Overwatch has already piqued the interest of many gamers, with almost 10 million players taking part in an early road test of the game.  Officially the trial period was to "test servers" and iron out any problems, but the studio's chief financial officer Dennis Durkin has acknowledged: "We're doing a tonne to expose players to the richness of this world."  "We learned a lot from the open test," Michael Chu, senior game designer at Blizzard, told the BBC. "We value the input of the community and we have been changing things here and there, addressing player concerns."  One of those concerns was about the portrayal of female characters. Some players complained that an over-the-shoulder victory pose for Tracer drew particular attention to her buttocks, while others questioned magazines featuring female characters littering the floor of an in-game toilet.  "There was a victory pose that we felt like we could make better and more exemplified the character. So we changed that," said Mr Chu.  The magazines were removed too, and the company says it has worked hard to create a diverse cast of characters.  "One thing we hope you'll notice in the game is that we have this big roster of heroes. We have some solider-like characters who have a military style, but we also have characters like Mercy, she's a guardian angel who moves around the battlefield healing.  "We wanted to get players working together as a team to achieve victory."  Despite speculation that Overwatch might be free to download, with revenue generated from in-game purchases, Blizzard said it had always intended to sell the game as an upfront purchase.  "It was always going to be a boxed product," said Mr Chu. "We feel like that is a really good way to go because so much of the gameplay comes from switching between heroes during combat, so having all the characters available rather than locked away was really important."  Unlike World of Warcraft, there will be no subscription fee to play Overwatch online. However, there will be in-game purchases in the form of Loot Boxes that can be used to customise characters.  Blizzard says that these can also be earned for free and it has promised "new maps and characters" will be added to the game at no cost.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36367216	Facebook to revamp Trending Topics	Facebook has announced changes to the way it runs its Trending Topics feed, following an internal investigation.  There will be more training for staff and the feed will no longer rely on a list of news organisations, including the BBC, Washington Post and Buzzfeed News, to validate subjects.  The feed, which lists popular headlines along with a brief description, has been accused of political bias.  However, Facebook's report found no evidence of this.  Facebook general counsel Colin Stretch said the investigation analysed 3,000 reviewer decisions following allegations that conservative issues were being suppressed.  The site was accused by anonymous former employees of tampering with its Trending Topics feature, promoting "progressive" views and websites over content presenting views from the American right.  Current and former staff were also interviewed by the firm.  The findings were revealed in a 12-page letter, addressed to US Senator John Thune but also published online, in response to Mr Thune's questions about the workings of Trending.  The Trending Topics feed currently works as a mixture of AI and human input, with potential subjects being suggested via algorithm and then reviewed by staff.  They are a mixture of popular subjects discussed on the social network and sourced from 1,000 media organisations. There was also a list of 10 organisations used to determine importance.  However, "as much as half" of the topics suggested algorithmically are rejected "because they do not make sense at the time or are duplicative", Mr Stretch said.  So-called "stale topics" - events still popular in discussions after two days but with no new developments - and "junk hashtags" - popular topics not related to actual events - are also sidelined, he added.  Topics with sources in foreign languages may also not be included on the grounds that the team may be unable to identify them, Mr Stretch explained.  The report did find that historically some topics that were discussed over a long period of time did not show up algorithmically.  For example, hashtags relating to the Black Lives Matter campaign failed to appear in December 2014 and were not manually inserted by the Trending Topics review team either.  However, the topic "Ferguson", which related to the police shooting of Michael Brown in Missouri, was added to compensate for this, wrote Mr Stretch.  Some Facebook users have queried the relevance of Trending Topics, which at the time of writing range from a "reported wardrobe malfunction" by US socialite Paris Hilton to the results of the Austrian presidential election.	tech

"They don't feel that anyone listens to them, never mind speaks for them," opposition whip Conor McGinn said.  He said the challenge facing leader, and Islington MP, Jeremy Corbyn was to relate to the rest of the UK.  Mr McGinn also warned that Labour could lose votes if it adopted an anti-nuclear weapons stance.  A review of the party's defence policy is under way. The Labour leader opposes Britain's Trident nuclear weapons system, but many of his MPs support its renewal.  Mr McGinn, who falls in to the latter category, warned: "Defence might not win you a lot of votes, but it can definitely lose you a lot of votes if you're not in the right place on it."  In an interview with Parliament's House magazine, Mr McGinn, MP for St Helens North, said: "I think there is a political crisis that has engulfed what would be seen as the traditional Labour working class. They don't feel that anyone listens to them, never mind speaks for them.  "And I think that's a real problem for the Labour Party particularly. Sometimes it can seem that we're preoccupied with things that are insignificant to the population."  Labour, he said, needed to appeal to ordinary voters if it wanted to win elections.  "I think when you lose an election you should look at the reasons why and try, within the parameters of your own values, to move closer to the public, not further away from the public."  He also set out what he saw as the "challenge" for Mr Corbyn, who after 30 years as a backbench MP representing the London constituency of Islington North was elected party leader in September 2015.  "I love London, and it's a fantastic city, and Islington is a great place," he said, "but it's not like the rest of the country".  "I think the challenge for Jeremy having been an MP for 30-odd years for a seat like Islington, is how he relates to the rest of the country," he added.  The MP also said many people wanted a secure job with a decent wage that enabled him to afford his own home, and an annual holiday or a new car.  "The problem with sections of the left is that they sneer at people like that," he said.  He added: "There is a patrician socialism that not only wants to tell working class people what's best for them, but what they should and shouldn't think.  "I think if we are to have a genuine revival in the politics of the left, then we need to start listening to people and hearing their truths."	politics

The social network told the BBC it had made a mistake and has now approved the image.  Australian feminist group Cherchez La Femme had expressed fury after Facebook rejected their advert for an event designed to promote body positivity.  Originally the social network told them the advert "depicts a body... in an undesirable manner".  While the event page was not taken down, the advert to promote it was not approved.  "Ads like these are not allowed since they make viewers feel bad about themselves," read the original response from Facebook's Ads Team, which the organisers shared as screenshots on their page.  It also suggested that an alternative image of someone "running or riding a bike" would be more appropriate.  "Our team processes millions of advertising images each week, so we occasionally make mistakes," said a spokesman.  "To be clear, the image complies with our advertising policies. We have now approved the image and apologise for any offence this caused."  Facebook's terms and conditions state that images used in advertising may not "show excessive amounts of skin or cleavage".  Jessamy Gleeson, one of the producers of the Melbourne-based "Feminism and Fat" event, told the BBC she was furious.  "They're not policing women's bodies when it comes to acceptable standards of beauty elsewhere," she said.  "I can see that they were attempting to try to tackle eating disorders - that makes sense - but at some point you have to consider that women of different weights exist on Facebook."  The group had contacted Tess Holliday's management for permission to use the image but had not received a reply, she said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36358517	Oculus anti-piracy update cracked in a day	An anti-piracy update for the Oculus virtual reality platform has been cracked within a day of release.  The update lets games verify that they were legitimately purchased and are running on an approved Oculus device.  It also breaks an unofficial patch called Revive that lets Oculus-only games run on rival devices.  But Revive's creator found he could disable digital rights management (DRM) in Oculus titles completely to keep the patch working.  That also stops software from verifying it has been legally purchased, paving the way for pirates to copy Oculus games.  "DRM as a means to prevent piracy is rather futile," said Ernesto Van der Sar, founder of news website TorrentFreak.  "If there's a demand to use a product or access a service, people will often find a way around DRM and other technological blockades.  "History has shown many examples of how it mostly inconveniences legitimate customers."  Facebook-owned Oculus has invested in exclusive software titles to encourage people to buy its virtual reality headset over competing devices.  The Revive patch, created by Libre VR, translated some of the functions of Oculus games into the OpenVR language, which is compatible with HTC's Vive and other headsets.  In December 2015, the company's founder Palmer Luckey said he did not mind if gamers did this.  "If customers buy a game from us, I don't care if they mod it to run on whatever they want," he wrote on online community Reddit.  He added that his goal was "not to profit by locking people to only our hardware".  The update to the Oculus operating system, released on Friday, introduced a new "platform integrity check" that let software identify whether an Oculus-approved headset was being used.  The developer of Libre VR responded with a new patch that bypassed DRM checks in some games completely. But that not only prevented software from checking whether it was being run on an Oculus headset, but also whether it had been legally purchased.  "This is my first success at bypassing the DRM, I really didn't want to go down that path," said the developer.  He told online technology magazine Motherboard: "By disabling the ownership check the game can no longer determine whether you legitimately own the game.  "I still do not support piracy - do not use this library for pirated copies."  Oculus has previously said people should not expect hacked games to work "indefinitely".  "Regular software updates to games, apps and our platform are likely to break hacked software," the company told technology news website Ars Technica in April.  Many gaming companies including Sony and Microsoft protect their software with some form of DRM, but Ernesto told the BBC it was not a surprise the Oculus update had been cracked so quickly.  "Oculus should focus on providing a superior platform and the best games instead of focusing on piracy at this point," he said.  "It's impossible to defeat piracy completely, but lessons from the movie and music industry show that providing great legal options work better than anti-piracy measures."	tech

The revised Project Ara handset no longer allows its main display or processors to be swapped out.  Google said the new design meant it could offer more space to other parts that added unusual functions.  One expert said the move increased the initiative's chance of success.  "A fully modular smartphone would have gone against every trend in the industry to integrate components tightly together and make smaller, faster devices as a result," said Ian Fogg, from the consultancy IHS Technology.  "By putting the front display, the processors and some of the core functionality into the frame's board, rather than on removable modules, it has significantly de-risked the project.  "That may not offer as much flexibility to users as the original plan, but it makes it easier for Google to bring Project Ara to market quickly."  Google originally revealed it was working on a customisable phone in October 2013, after its Motorola division - which it later sold - teamed up with the creator of the Phonebloks concept.  Just over a year later, Google announced it would shortly begin a trial in Puerto Rico, where it intended to offer consumers a frame and a range of 20 to 30 clip-on modules.  A promotional video published at the time suggested one of the benefits would be that owners could easily swap out a cracked screen and replace it with a new part.  But in August 2015, the pilot was cancelled and there was a change in leadership.  Ara's lead engineer Rafa Camargo described the new design as putting "modularity where it counts".  "We've integrated the phone technology in the frame. That frees up space for modules that will create and integrate new functionality that you cannot get on your smartphone today," he told developers at Google's IO conference in California.  He added that the revision meant the phone's frame could also become thinner and modules could be swapped without having to reboot the device.  The project's head of creative, Blaise Bertrand, said that one potential module would be a glucometer for people with diabetes, which he said was something mass-market handsets were unlikely to incorporate as standard.  He added that an advantage over current kit was that the phone could track a user's blood-sugar level alongside their activity levels rather than in isolation.  Mr Bertrand said his team was already working with Samsung, iHealth, Toshiba, Panasonic and Harman among others, to make the parts.  The current prototype can incorporate up to six modules, although Mr Camargo said that future frames could be larger or smaller.  Each slot should work for at least "10,000 connect cycles" he added, and the device could be made to eject one of the parts by giving it a voice command.  Google is now promising to release a developers' edition of the phone and "a few" modules before the end of the year, and aims to sell a version to the public in 2017.  It also intended to extend the concept to other types of computers, Mr Camargo added.  LG recently launched a modular phone of its own, to mixed reviews.  While many critics praised the idea behind the LG G5, they highlighted that only two add-on parts - a high-definition audio processor and a camera grip - currently took advantage of the facility.  "Google needs to make it very easy for developers to make the modules and easy for them to distribute and sell them," said Mr Fogg.  "How they are brought to market is going to be very important."	tech

It said material endorsing a terrorist organisation or its acts, or that encouraged people to join such groups, would be banned.  The rule will apply to services such as Xbox Live and Outlook webmail.  But Microsoft said it wanted its search engine, Bing, to be "unbiased" and would not remove terror-related search results unless required to by law.  The company said: "Societies, acting through their governments, ought to draw the line between free speech and limitations relating to particular types of content."  But it was considering adding "links to positive messaging and alternative narratives" to search results related to terrorism.  It encouraged people to report terror-related content on Microsoft services via its website, but said it wanted to develop technology that could scan documents, images, video and audio to identify known terror-related material.  In a blog post, the company said terrorism had "sparked intense discussion" about how companies should tackle such content on their services.  "We have a responsibility to run our various internet services so that they are a tool to empower people, not to contribute, however indirectly, to terrible acts," it said.  But it added it also wanted to "respect timeless values such as privacy, freedom of expression and the right to access information".	tech

Addressing activists, he called for a "mixed economy of public and social enterprise... a private sector with a long-term private business commitment".  He said a Labour government would break from the "failed economic orthodoxy".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.  At Labour's "state of the economy" conference in west London, Mr Corbyn set out his desire to reform capitalism and said his party needed to "deliver the new economy that this country needs".  "An economy that starts by tackling the grotesque levels of inequality within our society," went on Mr Corbyn.  "An economy that ensures every young person has the opportunities to maximise their talent and that produces the high-skilled, high-value, secure jobs they need. An economy that delivers new, more democratic forms of ownership and a zero-carbon economy that protects our environment."  Mr Corbyn said a proposed National Investment Bank would boost the UK's infrastructure.  "Building an economy for the future requires bold ambition, he said. "A new economics."  He said: "Wealth creation is a good thing: We all want greater prosperity. But let us have a serious debate about how wealth is created and how that wealth should be shared."  Having survived, so far, the rumblings of mutiny among fellow Labour MPs, both the party leader Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow chancellor John McDonnell are determined to begin setting out their economic pitch.  Mr Corbyn called it "a new economics". Mr McDonnell described his aim as being no less than the "fundamental business of reforming capitalism".  So today was big on vision, but short on new detail. Perhaps no surprise with the next general election, in all likelihood, not until 2020.  No one can doubt their ambition: "I want us to surpass even the Attlee government for radical reform," the shadow chancellor said, a reference to the administration that founded the NHS.  But to do that, they have to win the next general election.  Will Labour MPs put up with them for long enough for that to happen? And, if they do, can they sell such a left wing, socialist pitch to the electorate?  In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next election unless it showed it was a responsible custodian of public money.  "We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances," he said.  Councils would be given the power to limit "skyrocketing" rent increases, he added, pledging to help people "at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market".  The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.  They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.  Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.  Mr Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.  The "local rent regulation" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.  The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to "pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.  Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was "creating a bigger and better private rented sector".  "These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent," she said.	politics

The shadow chancellor pledged to help people "at the mercy of an unforgiving, unrestrained housing market".  And he said a future Labour government would build 100,000 council homes a year and boost home ownership.  Ministers said the "proposals for excessive state regulation" would "destroy investment in new housing".  At a conference on the economy hosted by Labour in London, party leader Jeremy Corbyn said government intervention was needed to solve the housing crisis.  He said the party would "always seek to distribute the rewards of growth more fairly" and pledged to break with the "failed economic orthodoxy that has gripped policy makers for more than a century".  Labour's proposed National Investment Bank will boost the UK's infrastructure, he added.  In his speech, Mr McDonnell said Labour would not win the next general election unless it showed that it was a responsible custodian of public money.  "We can reject the dreadful choice of austerity and maintain solid government finances," he said.  He highlighted reviews Labour had set up into the workings of the Treasury, HM Revenue & Customs and the remit of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee.  BBC News political correspondent Chris Mason said the shadow chancellor was seeking to take on critics that have suggested the party is only ever capable of grumbling about the government, rather than setting out an alternative.  But he said, coming four years before the next general election, the speech was big on vision, but short on detail.  The measures put forward at the conference will be subject to consultation, and will not immediately become party policy.  They include powers to regulate private rent rises - similar to those pledged by former Labour leader Ed Miliband in the party's unsuccessful general election campaign - below the rate of inflation for the duration of a tenancy.  Critics previously said Labour's pre-election proposals would reduce investment in housing stock.  The "local rent regulation" suggested by Mr McDonnell would be available to councils in each area, rather than set nationally.  The National Landlords Association welcomed Labour's focus on making housing more affordable but warned the party not to "pull the rug from under the feet of responsible landlords", while new Labour mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, told the BBC he did not favour rent controls in the capital.  Mr McDonnell said there would be a new "forum" for elected mayors who are in charge of cities across the country.  "For the first time, national economic policy making will be influenced directly by local decision makers representing their metropolises and their local communities," he told the conference.  The forum will look for solutions to the "housing crisis" with Labour favouring an extension of local authority-guaranteed mortgages.  Mr McDonnell said he wanted to see more local authorities following the examples of Manchester, Warrington and Sandwell by "offering cheap, local authority-backed mortgages to first-time buyers in particular".  He criticised the workings of the government's Help to Buy scheme, saying it was not targeted at people who need assistance the most.  "Labour would make it a mission to ensure that families and young people on ordinary incomes aren't locked out of home-ownership," he said.  He said new council homes would be a "top priority", funded by savings in the Housing Benefit bill.  The shadow chancellor said Labour governments under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown had relied too heavily on tax revenues from financial services, and public-private partnerships to fund infrastructure projects, and did not do enough to clamp down on tax evasion and avoidance .  "It helped create an unfair tax system," he said.  But he said in opposition, the party was holding the Conservatives to account and a future Labour government would ensure the UK would "no longer act like a tax haven for the super-rich".  Addressing the Labour proposals on housing, a Department for Communities and Local Government spokeswoman said the government was "creating a bigger and better private rented sector".  She added: "The vast majority of tenants across the country are seeing their rents remain stable, and are happy with the service they receive from landlords.  "These proposals for excessive state regulation would destroy investment in new housing, push up prices and make it far harder for people to find a flat or house to rent."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36311961	The teenager obsessed with retro Apple tech	Fifteen-year-old Alex Jason owns a vast collection of vintage Apple devices which he now plans to exhibit near his home in the US state of Maine.  Alex started collecting his "orchard" at the age of 10 and says he has around 1,000 items, stored in the basement of his family home.  He is currently involved in the renovation of a former library building in which he hopes to exhibit his collection next year.  He says he prefers PCs for gaming.  As a result he built his own computer which runs both Apple and Windows operating systems - complete with LED light displays.  "Graphics cards that are for PCs are more designed for gaming," he told the BBC.  "The only thing I don't like about Windows is the viruses. I know there's a few for Mac but Windows - you click on one thing you're not supposed to and you get hit."  Alex's dad Bill bought a job lot of 50 old Apple computers for $2,000 (£1,380) to start the collection off.  "Originally my goal was to get them, work on them, play retro games and learn the history," Alex said.  "Then I realised, showing my friends, that they'd never seen them. Dad and I got this vision to start a museum and that's been our goal."  While Bill has contributed to the collection, Alex has also raised money for new items by mowing lawns, as well as fixing and re-selling other computers.  "I traded my mini-bike and snow blower for an iMac G5," he said of one of his earlier purchases.  "A couple of my friends thought I was stupid, but I did it because the mini-bike needed a lot of work."  His collection includes Apple computers from almost every generation, in addition to prototypes and accessories, some more unusual than others, like the Apple Cursor 3 - a joystick-shaped mouse - which Alex believes is the only one that has ever surfaced.  Alex is currently on the look out for a very rare Lisa 1 computer, released by Apple in 1983.  The device was dogged by hard-drive problems so most were returned and destroyed by the company.  "When I'm looking at older computers, although I think they're awesome I have to lower my expectations, I know the processing power isn't as good as it is now," Alex admitted.  "The other night I was working on a Power Mac. It's a fantastic machine, they were fast when they came out but not now - you have to have patience and I don't have a lot."  So far Apple has not offered any official support, although Alex is hoping to get in touch with Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, aka Woz.  Alex has a 10-year-old sister who doesn't share his passion for retro-tech - but she definitely has inherited the Jason family tech enthusiasm.  "She is more software inclined," he said.  "She's doing a lot with Photoshop - cover art for video games."  Alex is very clear about his own career path.  "I want to get my computer engineering degree," he said.	tech

But No 10 said while it was traditional to meet US candidates visiting the UK, no invitations had been issued.  A spokeswoman said there were "no confirmed dates" for visits as party nominees had not yet been chosen.  The PM previously called Mr Trump's proposal for a ban on Muslims entering the US "stupid, divisive and wrong".  Last year Mr Trump, who is now the presumptive Republican nominee for the presidential election, said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  While it is true that hopefuls like Scott Walker, Chris Christie and Marco Rubio met the prime-minister when they were passing through London - that was before they had declared they were candidates for the Republican nomination.  A senior source said the PM would be happy to see Mr Trump once he becomes the official nominee - that will happen after the Republican Convention in July.  Four years ago the then Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, visited Downing Street - and caused consternation when he criticised Britain's preparedness for hosting the London 2012 Olympics.  Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."  Downing Street has since said the PM stands by his criticism of but will work with whoever is elected US president.  In an interview with US news channel MSNBC, Mr Trump said: "I will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he's a nice guy. I will do just fine."  He added: "But they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street - and I might do it."  Speaking on Friday, Mr Trump said he had been invited to Downing Street two days ago.  Downing Street said: "It's long-standing practice for the PM to meet with the Republican and Democrat presidential nominees if they visit the UK.  "Given the parties have yet to choose their nominees, there are no confirmed dates for this."	politics

Despite this, net use among this group is growing with the numbers trying the net doubling since 2011, it found.  It also revealed that 25% of disabled people have yet to use the net - a figure campaigners called "shocking".  About 88% of all UK adults, about 46 million people, used the net in the last three months, it said.  The ONS bulletin on net use in the first three months of 2016 revealed that 91% of people living in London went online regularly. By contrast, in Northern Ireland only 82% of people are regular users of online sites and services.  Pete Lee, from the ONS's surveys and economic division, said the statistics revealed some significant changes in usage and exposed those sectors of the population where net use remained low or patchy.  Net use among women aged 75 and over had grown by 169% since 2011, it found. However, it found that a significant number of older people who start using the net did not do so consistently. About 5% of those aged 75 or more had stopped using the net in early 2016.  "While we have seen a notable increase in internet usage across all groups in recent years, many older and disabled people are still not online," said Mr Lee.  Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said it was "shocking" that 25% of disabled people had not used the net as it created a significant digital divide.  "Digital access has the power to make life cost less," he said. "Many people go online to compare the best consumer deals and offers."  "Life costs more if you are disabled, from higher energy bills to specialist equipment. Scope research shows these costs add up to on average £550 per month," he added.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36340514	China 'flooding' social media with fake posts	China is "flooding" social media with comments by paid supporters in a bid to sway public opinion, a report has said.  The research by Harvard academics draws on leaked documents to paint a picture of the way China polices social media.  The government and its army of helpers write 488 million fake posts a year, the report said.  The profusion of comments on social media sits alongside other efforts, to find and delete content deemed too sensitive for Chinese citizens.  The vast majority of the comments and posts made on social media are crafted to look like they come from ordinary people, said the authors of the paper, who were led by Gary King from Harvard's department of government.  Many of the posts do not attempt to rebut or argue with critical commenters, they said.  "They do not step up to defend the government, its leaders, and their policies from criticism, no matter how vitriolic; indeed, they seem to avoid controversial issues entirely," said the paper.  "Letting an argument die, or changing the subject, usually works much better than picking an argument and getting someone's back up," it said.  More often Communist Party workers or ordinary citizens employed to post on behalf of the government engage in "cheerleading" about the state's achievements or its history.  The helpers are known within China as the "Fifty Cent Party" because of an unsubstantiated rumour that contributors are paid 50 cents for each of their posts.  The 488 million posts per year are made more effective by making sure they are added during the busiest times on social media or when a controversial issue is being widely debated.  The study used documents and spreadsheets leaked in 2014 that revealed the names and online pseudonyms of people employed by the Chinese authorities to post on the state's behalf.  The academics extrapolated from this sample in an attempt to estimate the true scale of official activity on social media sites.  There were good psychological reasons for using distraction rather than censorship or counter-arguments, the paper said.  "Since censorship alone seems to anger people, the 50c astroturfing program [entailing creation of fake grassroots content] has the additional advantage of enabling the government to actively control opinion without having to censor as much as they might otherwise," the authors concluded.	tech

Maker SoftBank is hoping that it will spur new apps and new capabilities for the humanoid robot which has sold well but still has no clear defined purpose.  Ten thousand of the robots have been sold but developers have been slow to make apps for its closed Naoqi operating system.  Android will run on a tablet strapped to the robot's chest.  Neither Google nor SoftBank has disclosed what sort of business deal they have struck and it is unclear if the robot will take advantage of new features such as the recently announced artificial intelligence Google Assistant.  But it will almost certainly offer Google some degree of control over the robot as well as a cut of revenues.  Pepper has been in big demand in Japan with each batch of 1,000 units selling out in minutes. It will go on pre-sale in the US in July.  It costs 198,000 yen ($1,800) and each one is sold at a loss.  The 1.2m (4ft) humanoid bot features more than 20 motors and has articulated arms. It was designed to understand emotions and mimic human body language - so, for instance, its shoulders go up when it is in standby mode, imitating sleep.  So far, Pepper is being used as a waiter, salesman and customer service representative in around 500 companies in Japan, including Nestle, Mizuho Bank and Nissan.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36340511	Gaming ransomware gang releases master decryption key	The gang who made the notorious Teslacrypt ransomware virus has shut up shop and released the master key it used to scramble data.  The key has been used to to make a free decryption tool that can unscramble files encrypted by the malware.  It means many of those hit by the malware will be able to recover data without paying a ransom.  It is not yet clear why the gang behind Teslacrypt decided to stop using their malware.  The Teslacrypt ransomware targeted gamers and, on infected machines, sought to encrypt more than 185 different types of files associated with popular games such as Call of Duty, Minecraft and World of Tanks.  Victims could get their files decrypted by paying a ransom of up to $1,000 (£690).  Over the past few weeks, researchers from security firm Eset noticed that the malware was being spammed out far less than usual. Many of the underground distributors of Teslacrypt were swapping to use a different ransomware family called CryptXXX.  Eset sent a message to the hackers behind Teslacrypt via the technical support address given on the payment page the malware displays on infected machines. In the message, Eset asked for a copy of the master encryption key.  To its surprise, it got a reply in which the hackers said the project was now "closed". In the body of the short message was the master encryption key used to scramble files on infected machines.  The message ended: "We are sorry!"  In a blogpost, Eset said it was "surprised" that the hackers had released the key so others can make a decryption tool.  Paul Ducklin from security firm Sophos said it was "unusual" for cyber-thieves to give away their secret key.  "Only victims who have been hit recently and haven't yet paid up, or victims who backed up their already-encrypted data "just in case", will get much use out of the master key at this stage," he wrote.  Mr Ducklin speculated about why the hackers had decided to stop sending out their ransomware. Perhaps, he said, the gang had been hacked by rivals who released the key to ruin the business of a competitor.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36330992	House of Lords: Where the Lib Dems still rule the roost	It was part-way through the Queen's Speech, just after she mentioned the EU referendum, so you might have missed it - but when she promised that "my ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons", she was signalling a retreat.  Just a few weeks ago, arguing that the primacy of the Commons was being undermined by the House of Lords, ministers were considering curbing the power of peers.  A new law would stop the Lords from blocking what is called secondary legislation. When the Queen's Speech was published on Wednesday, however, there was no bill.  During the parliamentary session just ended, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats. Of those, the most humiliating was over tax credits.  Here the government had argued the Lords was breaking a convention - an unwritten rule - that secondary legislation isn't rejected, because Parliament has already scrutinised and approved the principle behind it by passing the primary legislation.  Peers denied there was such a convention, pointing out they had thrown out secondary legislation on five previous occasions.  Lord Strathclyde, a former Leader of the Lords, was asked by the prime minister what should be done, and he recommended legislation to stop it.  It isn't just Conservatives who are unhappy with the Lords.  "We're defeating the government more often than is good for us," a Labour peer told me recently - but isn't that the job of the opposition?  Yet it is not so simple as that if you expect your party to be in power again one day. Then, you worry about the House of Lords doing the same to your legislation.  My Labour source blames the Liberal Democrats, as well as David Cameron for allowing his coalition partner to nominate so many new peers in the last Parliament.  It is the Lib Dems, he says, who insist on inflicting so many defeats. Labour peers don't like it, but fear if they don't go along with it, Lib Dems will say they have become the only real opposition to the Tories.  So what are the Lib Dems up to? Lord Newby, the chief whip, cheerfully admits he is up for a fight.  "There's no point in us existing," he told me, "if we don't vote for the things we believe in."  That's another thing, says my Labour contact: they hardly exist at all in the Commons, most of their MPs were rejected by the voters, yet in the Lords it is as if the general election never happened.  In the Commons, just eight of 650 MPs are Lib Dems; in the Lords, they have 109 peers out of 807, about half of the number of Labour, with the Conservatives on 247.  Lord Newby denies it is undemocratic for his party to wield so much influence when the party was almost wiped out at the general election.  "The only suggestion I can make is get used to it or reform the House of Lords," he says.  Labour peers believe this is the real strategy, provoking a constitutional crisis; after all, the Lib Dems have no love for the Lords, and want a wholly elected second chamber in its place.  "It's true we don't have a vested interest in the mechanism as it is," says Lord Newby, though he denies wanting to precipitate reform by creating a crisis.  He thinks the real vested interest is that of the two biggest parties. He accuses Labour of backing a "spurious" Conservative claim that governments get their way in the Lords 70% of the time.  He even accuses them of deliberately engineering some unnecessary votes when there aren't enough opposition peers around, so the government wins, helping keep up that average of government successes.  I suspect the real reason David Cameron backed off from a confrontation from the Lords actually lies elsewhere: in the House of Commons.  Earlier this month, MPs on the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, said removing the Lords power to veto secondary legislation would be a mistake.  The committee, chaired by Bernard Jenkin, one of Mr Cameron's most trenchant Conservative critics, was clear.  "We think the issue of the excessive size and unbalanced composition of the Lords is a much more pressing issue, and it is wrong to consider the powers and functions of the House of Lords in isolation, on the basis of one wholly exceptional and highly political event," he said.  It is the increasing difficulty he has with Conservative MPs. On tax credits and making all secondary schools become academies, to give just two examples, it was Tory MPs who rebelled.  Loyalty, it used to be said, was the party's secret weapon. Today, a significant number of MPs no longer see it as a virtue.  As the measures announced in the Queen's Speech work their way through the parliamentary machine in the coming months, don't be misled by the number of defeats MPs inflict on the government.  It is the number of measures withdrawn before any vote is taken, or never proposed at all, which is the real measure of the government's problem.	politics

In 2015, the Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL) said Google should respect French "right to be forgotten" rulings worldwide.  But Google said the ruling could lead to abuse by "less open and democratic" countries.  The company is now appealing against a 100,000-euro (£76,000) CNIL fine.  The "right to be forgotten" refers to a landmark ruling passed by the European Union's Court of Justice (ECJ) in May 2014.  It gives people the right to have results linked to their name removed from search websites, if they "appear to be inadequate" or "irrelevant".  Google says results can end up removed "even when those links point to truthful and lawfully published information like newspaper articles or official government websites".  Companies offering services to European citizens must comply with the ruling, even if their websites are not hosted in Europe.  Google said it had reviewed almost 1.5 million requests, of which about 40% resulted in the removal of a search result.  Google has previously said it does remove results when a valid "right to be forgotten" request is made.  However, it currently does not remove the affected search results from all versions of its website worldwide.  People using Google in Europe cannot find the deleted results using any version of the search engine - but people outside Europe can see the affected search results when they use a non-European version of the website such as google.com.  The CNIL wants Google to remove the affected search results globally.  It has pointed out it is relatively simple for Europeans to access international versions of Google and find the deleted results.  Google has argued that a French authority such as the CNIL should not "impose measures outside of the nation's borders".  "For hundreds of years, it has been an accepted rule of law that one country should not have the right to impose its rules on the citizens of other countries," said Kent Walker, the company's general counsel.  In an open letter published in French newspaper Le Monde, Google said it had already received requests from countries to block content worldwide that was illegal locally.  "If French law applies globally, how long will it be until other countries - perhaps less open and democratic - start demanding that their laws regulating information likewise have global reach?" it said.  "This order could lead to a global race to the bottom, harming access to information that is perfectly lawful to view in one's own country.  "This is not just a hypothetical concern. We have received demands from governments to remove content globally on various grounds.  "We have resisted, even if that has sometimes led to the blocking of our services."  According to AFP, Google expects the Council of State, France's highest court, will take at least a year to review its appeal.  "We look forward to the court's review of this case," said Mr Walker.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36306419	Archive of historic BT hack preserved	An archive detailing a historic hack and its fallout has been handed over to the National Museum of Computing.  Previously, the cache of documents, press cuttings and letters had been kept by Robert Schifreen, who hacked BT's Prestel system in 1984.  He and Steve Gold took control of Prestel and penetrated the email inbox belonging to the Duke of Edinburgh.  The legal case around the hack helped define computer misuse laws in the UK and around the world.  The archive contains detailed information about how the hack was carried out and the two-year legal wrangle it began.  Robert Schifreen said the whole saga had begun by accident.  "I was testing a modem and was typing in random numbers to see if they worked or not," Mr Schifreen told the BBC. "And one of them did."  The number gave access to Prestel - a basic, text-based computer system developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s that gave people an early taste of online information services.  Customers dialled up and browsed thousands of pages that held information about everything from stocks and shares to weather forecasts and news headlines. In 1983, it was expanded to include a crude form of email.  Purely by accident, Mr Schifreen had stumbled across a live Prestel account that had the number 2222222222 and a password of 1234.  Even better, it was not a customer account.  "It was only supposed to be for Prestel staff," he said.  A quick scan of the pages available via this account revealed a phone number for a test mainframe used by administrators maintaining the service.  "I tried that on and off for a good few months," said Mr Schifreen. "One day, after months of trying, I dialled up this test computer, and it showed a page saying, 'This is the system manager password'."  "I logged in with it, and it said, 'Welcome to Prestel. You are now system manager'."  Initially, this gave Mr Schifreen and Mr Gold access to only the test system. However, the Prestel system administrators had made another security blunder.  "The golden rule they broke was that in this test computer they used live data," Mr Schifreen said.  "They used live passwords on that test machine."  Those live passwords let the pair get access to the working system.  The hack was aided by the fact that the two men were dialling up after 18:00, when phone calls got a lot cheaper.  This had proved useful, Mr Schifreen said, because by then the Prestel security team had gone home for the day.  As a responsible hacker, Mr Schifreen was open about his findings and informed Prestel owner BT about his high-level access and his ability to change any page on Prestel.  Initially, BT dismissed his claim that he could edit any page and brushed him off.  "I changed [the main login page] and then called them back and said, 'Now tell me it cannot be done,'" he said. "They got straight on the phone to Scotland Yard."  But there was just one problem with calling in the cyber-cops - at the time there, was no law under which the men could prosecuted.  "There were no specific laws," said John Austen, former head of the Scotland Yard computer crime unit, who arrested Mr Schifreen and Mr Gold.  "But that was not just in the UK. There were no laws anywhere in the world other than prosecutions undertaken by the FBI into wire fraud."  "I'd never arrested computer hackers before then," he said.  Initially, the pair were charged with offences under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act as this was the law that seemed to capture the essence of what they had done in reusing the internal passwords.  The charges stuck, and the two hackers were found guilty.  They appealed, and the conviction was overturned.  The prosecution sought to get this decision undone, which led to the case being referred to the House of Lords.  But the Lords upheld the original appeal, and the two men were acquitted in 1986.  At the time, Lord Justice Lane said it had been inappropriate to use the forgery law to prosecute the two hackers.  "The police were quite happy that I was acquitted as it demonstrated the need for a computer hacking act of some sort," Mr Schifreen said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36332146	Google patents 'sticky car' to reduce crash injuries	Google has patented a sticky coating for driverless cars that could reduce damage done to pedestrians in the event of a collision.  People struck by the vehicle would become glued to its bonnet, rather than being thrown off and further injured.  One transport safety professor said the concept could reduce injuries sustained in a pedestrian collision.  Google did not say whether it intended to implement the idea in its driverless vehicles.  "It does have some merit to it," said Andrew Morris, Professor of Human Factors in Transport Safety at Loughborough University.  "When pedestrian accidents happen, often the person is thrown up onto the bonnet and there may be injuries from that contact, but sometimes there are not.  "But when a driver brakes in a collision, a totally natural reaction, the pedestrian is thrown onto the ground and you can get injuries from that contact."  Google's patent explained that the adhesive layer would be hidden under a protective coating, to ensure it did not gather debris during journeys.  "Upon the initial impact between the colliding object and the vehicle, the coating is broken, exposing the adhesive layer," the patent document said.  Google has been testing driverless cars since 2009, and the company says its vehicles have driven more than a million miles autonomously.  While there have been some minor collisions along the way, the most serious involving a bus, the company's monthly reports suggest a majority of incidents are the fault of human drivers in other vehicles.  Prof Morris said it remained to be seen whether the idea would work in practice.  "Whether they could realistically make a car that has the right material in it and works reliably, we can't categorically say that," he told the BBC.  Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: "As well as developing new technology that prevents pedestrians from being hit in the first place, it's also crucial to develop ways of reducing the severity of injuries suffered if a pedestrian is knocked over."  "This idea is a fascinating example of just how far vehicle technology is changing," he told the BBC.  "It will obviously need to be developed and tested to ensure that it works reliably and doesn't cause any unintended consequences."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36330031	Ed Balls to publish 'revelatory' political memoirs	Ed Balls is to publish his political memoirs in the run-up to Labour's annual party conference in the autumn.  Mr Balls, a minister in former Labour PM Gordon Brown's government and shadow chancellor under Ed Miliband, lost his seat at the 2015 general election.  The book is billed as a "brave and revelatory account" of his time on the Labour front bench.  Mr Balls has recently kept out of the limelight - until he entered the fray in the EU referendum debate this week.  The former shadow cabinet minister shared a platform with Chancellor George Osborne and former Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable to campaign for a Remain vote on 23 June.  Mr Balls' book, called Speaking Out - Lessons In Life And Politics, will come out on 8 September - two weeks before Jeremy Corbyn's second conference as Labour leader.  Publishers Hutchinson said: "Speaking Out is a brave and revelatory account by an influential thinker and an extraordinary politician.  "It is a project that is unique in its candour, eloquence and range: a reckoning, a record of a remarkable career and a rallying cry."  The publishers said Mr Balls would use the book to talk about "victory and failure: about the mistakes made, change delivered and personalities encountered over the course of two decades at the frontline of British politics".  After he lost his Morley and Outwood seat to the Conservatives in last year's general election, Mr Balls became a senior fellow at Harvard University and chairman of Norwich City FC.	politics

They are Lord Bridges, Lord Neill of Blaydon, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield and Baroness Lady Thomas of Walliswood.  Under the House of Lords Reform Act 2014, peers who fail to attend proceedings for a whole session have their membership ended.  Speaking in the Lords, Lady D'Souza thanked them for "their much valued service" - which was met with laughter.  She said: "I have to notify the House that the noble Lords Lord Bridges, Lord Neill of Blaydon, Lord Thomas of Macclesfield and the noble Baroness Lady Thomas of Walliswood yesterday ceased to members of the House under section 2 of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014 by virtue of not attending any proceedings of the House during the session 2015-16.  "On behalf of the House I should like to thank the noble Lords for their much valued service to the House."  Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Walmsley later criticised the "unfortunate laughter" that greeted the announcement.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36326627	Google launches conversation-based Assistant	Google has announced a conversation-based tool to control smartphones, smartwatches and other devices.  Google Assistant can be used to find information, play media and carry out tasks - such as booking cinema tickets - via a back-and-forth chat between the user and the software.  The firm also announced a voice-activated device with a built-in speaker called Google Home to provide the tech in living rooms.  It will compete with Amazon's Echo.  Amazon launched its own dialogue-based smart home device in 2014, and has since included the Alexa voice assistant that powers Echo in some of its other products.  Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai credited Amazon with having pioneered the idea.  His announcement was made at the start of the firm's IO developers' conference in California.  "Google's new Assistant is its attempt to bring together a set of disparate efforts that have lacked a coherent brand," commented Jan Dawson from Jackdaw Research.  "Referring to the combined functions of Google Now, OK Google, and other elements has been tough in the past, because there wasn't a single name for this functionality.  "This should help Google compete more effectively both with Amazon's Echo device but also with better-branded personal assistants like Siri, Cortana, and Alexa."  Google Assistant can link into third-party services including Ticketmaster, Spotify, Uber and Whatsapp. But Alexa already works with many more.  "Amazon should take note of Google Home given Google's search and artificial intelligence capability, but Alexa has an early lead in third-party integration," noted Geoff Blaber from the CCS Insight consultancy.  Google Assistant also plays a role in a new chat app called Allo, in which it can make suggestions based on what the user is talking about with their friends.  One executive demonstrated the AI tool proposing a restaurant to visit when two users discussed wanting to eat Italian food.  Allo's other unusual feature is that it can provide replies on its user's behalf.  This includes commenting on pictures sent by friends, thanks to its use of image recognition algorithms.  The company acknowledged that the process would not be perfect but said the suggestions should improve the more people used the app.  A partner video chat app called Duo provides a live view of the caller before the recipient decides whether or not to answer.  In the past, Google IO has provided a first look at the next version of Android.  But many details about Android N were released weeks ahead of this year's event.  However, there were new details about a forthcoming feature how virtual reality would be integrated into the OS via a platform called Daydream.  It introduces a dedicated VR app store and provides a set of specifications that devices must meet in order to provide a lag time of less than 20 milliseconds between a movement of the user's body and an on-screen response.  Daydream also includes a reference design for a VR headset mount, into which phones can be fitted, and a controller - a handheld device featuring a trackpad and two buttons.  Google is not making either, but hopes that manufactures will put its designs into production.  "One of the worst things about Samsung's Gear VR [headset] is the control system - Daydream looks much better," said Mr Dawson.  The firm also announced an upgrade to its smartwatch OS, Android Wear.  It now supports "standalone" apps, meaning the software can link directly to the cloud via wi-fi or a watch's own 3G/4G chip, rather than having to link up via a smartphone.  This should make apps run faster and addresses a problem that had also plagued apps on the original version of Apple's rival Watch OS.  In addition, the updated Android Wear provides ways to reply to messages beyond speaking into the device's microphone.  Users will able to:  How practical this will be is unclear, particularly as an on-stage demo went wrong.  "Android Wear 2.0 is a reset for Google's wearables platform," said Mr Blaber.  "Having learned lessons from the first generation, Google and partners will hope 2.0 will kick start wearables adoption and usage."  Google rounded off IO's first event with a look at a feature that could shake up one of Android key principles.  Rather than making users install an additional app each time they want to access a new service, the firm wants to make it possible to quickly download only the code needed to carry out a specific task.  "We are evolving Android apps to run instantly without installation," explained Google executive Ellie Powers.  "As a developer... you'll modularise your app and Google Play will download only the parts that are needed on the fly."  Examples given included a parking meter app that automatically presents its payment interface when a motorist leaves their car at a stand, and a news app that streams its videos when a user clicks a link.  The idea echoes Scopes found in Ubuntu's smartphone OS and Microsoft's App-V facility, which both aim to provide access to third-party services without making users download full apps.  Analysts had mixed feelings about the proposition.  "Android Instant Apps [are the] first real signs of the post-app era," tweeted Gartner's Brian Blau.  But Creative Strategies' Carolina Milanesi wrote: "Is it like a smart preview that will get me to install the apps I don't have?"  And Moor Insights' Patrick Moorhead added: "When I think about Android Instant Apps, why is the first thing I think of [a] security panic?"	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36318353	Queen's Speech: Prison shake-up at heart of new laws	The government's planned new laws have been set out by the Queen - including the biggest prison shake-up in England and Wales "since Victorian times".  Satellite-tagging will be used and re-offending league tables published.  There is also support for a spaceport and driverless cars - but a planned British Bill of Rights is on hold.  EU Out campaigners criticised the absence of a promised Sovereignty Bill and said legislation had been "watered down" because of June's referendum.  But David Cameron said it was a "bold" and "radical" agenda.  He told MPs: "This is a Queen's Speech that combines economic security with extending life chances for all, it's the Queen's Speech of a progressive, one nation Conservative government."  But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, giving his response in the Commons, accused Mr Cameron of turning a blind eye to the "consequences" of cuts to public services, branding his government a "driverless car heading in the wrong direction".  He added: "This government is failing to deliver an economy that meets the needs and aspirations of the people that sent us here - a government that is consistently failing to meet its own economic targets.  "They have failed on the deficit, failed on the debt, failed on productivity, failed to rebalance the economy."  He said the government had been "forced to back down" on a series of proposals in recent months - most recently on forced academisation of all England's schools - and predicted that many of the bills announced would never reach the statute book.  The gold shone bright as ever. The gleaming horses trotted in traditional time.  But the biggest event of Parliament's year felt like an impeccably choreographed, grandly produced, historically faithful sideshow.  The only hint of change in the ceremony - the monarch, for the first time, taking the lift.  David Cameron's hope for today was to create a coherent sense of his remaining ambitions, help for those he believes politics has left behind.  For his critics it takes some convincing, particularly in a time of cuts, to give that any credence.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said policies such as the planned renewal of Trident nuclear weapons, a continued squeeze on public spending and signals of "yet more cuts to welfare" were at odds with the Scottish government's "progressive agenda".  The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament, a tradition that can be traced back to 1536.  For the first time, the Queen used a lift rather than a flight of stairs when she arrived at the Houses of Parliament in what Buckingham Palace said was a "modest adjustment to arrangements" made "for the Queen's comfort".  Other measures in the 21-Bill programme include:  The government is also pushing ahead with controversial plans to monitor internet use through its Investigatory Powers Bill and crack down on extremism, including stronger powers to disrupt radicals' activities and to intervene in unregulated schools which are "teaching hate".  The Queen's Speech is being seen as an attempt to secure a legacy of social reform for the prime minister but critics say it is overshadowed by 23 June's referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU, which has split the Cabinet.  Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused the government of abandoning plans for a Sovereignty Bill, promised earlier this year, to reassert the supremacy of the UK Parliament.  He accused David Cameron of "jettisoning or watering down" key elements of legislation in a "helter-skelter pursuit" to win the referendum.  UKIP deputy leader Paul Nuttall described the Queen's Speech as "light on major announcements," adding that some Conservative MPs had been "convinced to support Cameron's decision to support the 'Remain' side by promises of a Sovereignty Bill, and they must now feel utterly betrayed by the man they're whipped into cheerleading".  The Queen made only the briefest of direct references to her government holding "a referendum on membership of the European Union".  But - in a move that may be seen as an attempt to reassure voters ahead of the EU referendum - she added: "My ministers will uphold the sovereignty of Parliament and the primacy of the House of Commons."  The planned prison reforms, drawn up by Justice Secretary and leading Leave campaigner Michael Gove, were billed as the centrepiece of the Speech.  Mr Cameron told MPs: "For too long in our country the young offender institutions and prisons have not been working. They give the public the security of knowing that offenders are locked in but they're not doing enough to turn around the lives of people who will one day be let out.  "So in our prisons we are going to apply the lessons learned in other public service reforms - publishing results, giving the people who run the services proper control over them, encouraging innovation, rewarding success and not tolerating persistent failure."  He rejected claims by Green MP Caroline Lucas that the reforms would be undermined by big cuts to prison budgets and overcrowding, saying the government's "whole aim was to try and do more with less".  One of Europe's biggest jails, HMP Wandsworth, is among six institutions where governors will be given new powers over budgets and setting the daily regime.  Satellite tracking tags which monitor the movements of offenders using GPS technology will be piloted in eight police areas from September, in a move which could see prisoners become weekend inmates and spend the rest of the week at home as they hold down jobs.  Prisons will also be forced to publish statistics on education, reoffending and inmates' employment on release.  According to The Guardian, the government will also adopt the findings of a review of education in prisons, which will recommend allowing inmates to use iPads in their cells to "learn independently" and stay in touch with friends and family via Skype.	politics

But its Nokia-branded handsets - which are powered by the Series 30+ operating system, making them less powerful than its Lumia Windows phones - will continue to live on.  The division that makes them has been acquired by HMD Global, a new private equity-backed firm, and Foxconn subsidiary FIH Mobile.  Nokia said it had signed a 10-year deal for them to continue using its name.  "Feature phones were never a core part of Microsoft's strategic aim behind the purchase of Nokia's devices business," commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology research team.  "Following the Microsoft reorganisation last year, it was clear the feature phone business was an unwanted extra and Microsoft most likely took the first good offer to take the business off its hands.  "While the feature phone market is declining, shipments were still in excess of 400 million units in 2015. The Nokia brand is very strong in certain markets too and HMD will probably target these emerging markets."  Microsoft is being paid $350m (£240m) for the deal, which includes the Taiwanese firm Foxconn taking ownership of a feature phone factory in Hanoi.  About 4,500 workers will switch companies as part of the arrangement, with the deal due to be completed before the end of the year.  In a separate agreement, HMD has acquired the exclusive rights to use Nokia's name for a new range of smartphones and tablets.  HMD is owned by Smart Connect, a private equity firm led by Jean-Francois Baril. The executive worked at Nokia for 13 years, serving as its chief procurement officer until 2012.  "Branding has become a critical differentiator in mobile phones, which is why our business model is centred on the unique asset of the Nokia brand and our extensive experience in sales and marketing," said HMD's chief executive Arto Nummela.  For years to come students at business school will study the deal that saw Microsoft pay $7.2bn for the Nokia mobile phone business in 2014 - and not in a good way.  The deal was Steve Ballmer's last throw of the dice as Microsoft chief executive and on the day it was announced he told me it was a "big bold step… an important piece of the puzzle as Microsoft seeks to become this phenomenal device and services business".  But the following year, almost the entire cost of the deal had been written off and the Nokia brand had gone from the high-end Lumia phones.  Now the feature phone business - which had always made Nokia a household name in countries like India - has been sold too. At the same time, Finland's Nokia, still a big force in telecoms networks, has unveiled a plan to make it a force in phones again by licensing the brand to another Finnish firm started by former employees.  Although Microsoft has given up on becoming a "phenomenal" device business, half of Ballmer's strategy is beginning to work. Under Satya Nadella, it's finding that selling services is a more profitable path than making phones.  Nokia itself is currently focused on telecoms infrastructure equipment, smart health kit and high-end virtual reality cameras.  But the deal allows it to benefit from its mobile legacy without taking on much risk itself.  "These deals reunify the Nokia brand feature phones with the upcoming Nokia-brand smartphones," said Mr Fogg.  "That will make it easier for HMD to upsell consumers from feature phones to smartphones in countries where Nokia feature phones are still in usage."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36324835	Andy Burnham to run for Manchester mayor role	Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham will put himself forward to become the mayor of Greater Manchester.  Mr Burnham told the Guardian the role was "a cabinet-level job, which needs cabinet-level experience".  The Leigh MP said Westminster had "become a bit of an irrelevance for some people" adding that "we really need to change the way politics works".  The first elections for the role, currently filled by interim mayor Tony Lloyd, will be held in 2017.  Mr Lloyd and another former Labour minister, Ivan Lewis, are also seeking Labour's nomination.  Mr Burnham, the former health secretary, had been expected to announce his candidacy on Thursday but his intentions became clear when one of his Twitter profiles was rebranded as "Andy4Manchester".  As a national political figure over many years, Andy Burnham will be seen as the first genuine big hitter to throw his name in the hat to become Greater Manchester mayor.  The Leigh MP's move will be read by many as him giving up on a Labour return to government in 2020, but it's also a sign of the shift in power from Westminster to the North West.  Mr Burnham wasn't part of any negotiation for devolution to Greater Manchester and he was completely taken by surprise by the deal to merge health and social care, claiming the area was taking responsibility for an "NHS funding crisis" rather than anything else.  But time passes quickly in politics and Mr Burnham now sees opportunity where he once predicted disaster.  He'll be up against two well-established candidates for Labour who have spent months visiting local party groups to garner support.  He may find that being a big player in the national game doesn't particularly endear you to those who've stayed home to hold the fort but he's a formidable addition to the panel Labour members will eventually choose from.  The race to be the mayor of Greater Manchester has just got a bit more interesting.  Powerful regional mayors are a key part of the government's drive to devolve more responsibility to local authorities for Whitehall.  About 2.7 million people live in Greater Manchester, which has been at the forefront of the devolution project under the "Northern Powerhouse" banner.  Among the new powers transferred to the new mayor - who will also hold the office of police and crime commissioner - are responsibility for a £300m housing investment fund and control of transport budgets.  The leaders of the 10 councils that make up the Greater Manchester Combined Authority will form part of the new mayor's cabinet.  Another shadow cabinet minister Luciana Berger, recently said she was considering running for the new "metro mayor" role in the Liverpool area.  Speaking to The Guardian, Mr Burnham rejected the suggestion his decision showed he did not think Labour could win the 2020 general election, saying the party could "gain strength" from the powers being given to cities.	politics

Governors at six "reform prisons" in England will be given direct control.  Such freedoms for governors should be part of a modern justice system, the Prison Reform Trust said.  But the government must also address "real problems within prisons", the Prison Officers' Association warned.  Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, welcomed the government's new focus.  "For far too long prisons have been our most neglected, least visible public service," she said.  "More freedom for governors, long overdue access to modern IT, sensible plans for release on temporary licence and constructive use of tagging to curtail liberty should all be part of a modern justice system."  But she stressed the most pressing priority was to restore prison safety and stem a "catastrophic rise" in suicides, violence and disorder.  "Reform will run into the sand unless government is prepared to tackle prison numbers and introduce major sentencing reform as part of its groundbreaking Prisons Bill," she said.  Under the Prisons and Courts Reform Bill:  The prime minister first outlined plans to give prison governors "complete control" over their prisons in February.  The education plans follow an independent review of prison education by former head teacher Dame Sally Coates.  The prison reform plans were first outlined by David Cameron in February - and the concerns remain the same now as they were then.  How can such changes have a meaningful impact on rehabilitation, education and reoffending when so many jails are struggling simply to maintain order and stability?  If successful, the greater freedom governors will have, and the incentives on offer for improved performance, may help drive down recidivism levels and, as a result, reduce the overall prison population.  But there are so many factors that affect whether a prisoner steers clear of crime after release - family support, housing, employment to name a few - that there can be no guarantee that the changes to the way prisons are managed will be successful.  The Prison Officers' Association, the sector's union, said it was "still questioning" what freedom for governors really meant.  But it said it would "engage" with any new freedoms. Prison regimes had to tackle the "unprecedented" rise in violence, self-harming and deaths, a statement said.  Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, welcomed more autonomy for governors but said the success of the reforms would depend on the government driving down prisoner numbers.  The Prison Governors' Association said most governors were in favour of having greater autonomy but some feared that, without increased resources in prisons, they could be "held accountable for matters outside of their control".  Labour's shadow justice secretary, Charles Falconer, said the government had failed "every time" at reforming prisons in the past.  Instead prisons have become "dangerously overcrowded with rising levels of violence, drug abuse and serious assaults on staff", he said.  Of the six prisons pinpointed, inspectors have warned that Ranby prison is at risk of being overwhelmed by the supply of legal highs. A a prisoner was murdered at Coldingley in April.  Chief inspector: 'Some prisons not fit for purpose'  Rapt, a charity which helps prisoners give up drugs and crime, welcomed the changes but said it was "critical" to improve education and tackle the issues of drugs, mental health and violence.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36320322	Millions of hacked LinkedIn IDs advertised 'for sale'	A hacker is advertising what he says is more than one hundred million LinkedIn logins for sale.  The IDs were reportedly sourced from a breach four years ago, which had previously been thought to have included a fraction of that number.  At the time, the business-focused social network said it had reset the accounts of those it thought had been compromised.  LinkedIn now plans to repeat the measure on a much larger scale.  One expert said the service should have reset all its accounts the first time round.  LinkedIn is often used to send work-related messages and to find career opportunities - activities its members would want to stay private.  Criminals could make use of this information or see if its subscribers had used the same passwords elsewhere.  "We are taking immediate steps to invalidate the passwords of the accounts impacted, and we will contact those members to reset their passwords," a spokeswoman for the California-based firm told the BBC.  "We have no indication that this is a result of a new security breach.  "We encourage our members to visit our safety centre to ensure they have two-step verification authentication and to use strong passwords in order to keep their accounts as safe as possible."  Details of the sale were first reported by the news site Motherboard.  It said the details were being advertised on at least two hacking-related sites.  A total of 117 million passwords are said to be included.  The passcodes are encoded, but in a form that appears to have be relatively easy to reverse-engineer.  LinkedIn had about 165 million accounts at the time of the breach, but the discrepancy in the figures might be explained by the fact that some of its users logged in via Facebook.  After the breach first occurred, a file containing 6.5 million encrypted passwords was posted to an online forum in Russia.  LinkedIn reacted by saying it had invalidated all the accounts it believed had been compromised and emailed affected members saying they needed to register new passwords.  But Motherboard has tracked down one user, whose details are in the batch currently on sale, and found that the password listed for him was still active.  A security researcher who has also been given access to about one million of the advertised IDs said he believed it was "highly likely" that the leak was real.  "I've personally verified the data with multiple subscribers [of my own site] 'Have I been pwned'," Troy Hunt told the BBC.  "They've looked at the passwords in the dump and confirmed they're legitimate."  Another expert noted that the problem stemmed from the fact that LinkedIn had originally "hashed" its passwords but not "salted" them before storing them.  Hashing involves using an algorithm to convert passwords into a long string of digits. Salting is a secondary step meant to stop unauthorised parties from being able to reverse the process.  "A salt involves adding a few random characters, which are different on a per-user basis, to the passwords," explained Rik Ferguson, chief technology officer at the cybersecurity firm Trend Micro.  By doing this, he added, you prevent hackers from working out the encoding process by referring to tables that list commonly-used passwords and the various hashes they produce.  LinkedIn introduced salting after the attack, but that only benefits the login databases it generated afterwards.  "Using salting is absolutely best practice for storing passwords under any circumstances and was the case back in 2012 as well," Mr Ferguson said.  "If LinkedIn is saying now that it didn't know which accounts had been affected by the breach, then the sensible thing to have done at the time would have been a system-wide forced reset of every password."	tech

Speaking to BBC HARDtalk's Stephen Sackur, Lord Lester QC argued it was a question of values adding that the European Court of Human Rights defends common values including liberty, free speech and privacy.  The 1998 HRA incorporates the European Convention of Human Rights into domestic law and requires British courts to "take into account" judgments of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR).

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36320413	Queen's Speech: EU vote awkward backdrop to PM's plans	So Parliament's show of the year is here - the full regalia of state has seen Westminster bursting into colour.  The Queen's Diamond Jubilee state coach made its way to the Palace of Westminster carrying the Imperial State Crown before both houses came together for her speech.  It is a moment when the unity of state is on very purposeful display.  But after the gilded regalia is gone and the red carpets are stripped away a more prosaic political reality returns.  Her Majesty's Government is drawn from a party with a small majority locked into public division over an EU referendum with the potential to decide the fate of her prime minister and members of the cabinet.  In press released comments to accompany the speech, David Cameron said the government's legislative programme involved "difficult choices" and "big and bold reforms".  But those reforms are likely to be a little less difficult and perhaps a touch smaller and less bold than they might otherwise be - because the wrong referendum result has the potential to terminate the prime minister's oversight of all of them.  This is a moment when Mr Cameron can ill afford controversies over planned legislation or public spats with his own backbenchers threatening to rebel over upcoming bills.  It is striking that some of the most heavily trailed parts of the Queen's Speech are those that have the effect of promoting the government's desire to be seen as compassionate.  The programme sees legislation introduced "to tackle some of the deepest social problems in society, and improve life chances".  The planned laws involve changes to adoption and social work designed to lift children out of poverty and prison reform for "changed and reformed lives" for offenders.  The prominence given to these announcements follows a series of damaging climb downs in which critics accused ministers of having to be forced to take the compassionate argument in the face of threatened backbench rebellions.  Take the recent changes of heart by the government - which has a working majority of just 17 - over housing child refugees from Europe or over planned welfare cuts for the disabled.  The latter involved the resignation of Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, who after a fierce battle with the Treasury left behind him excoriating comments suggesting the government had lost its way in helping the poorest.  Of course, Mr Duncan Smith - who opposes Britain's membership of the EU - leads us back to the prime minister's bigger battle - the referendum. The campaign has split the Conservative Party and is becoming increasingly embittered with rows having the potential to bleed through into other areas of policymaking.  The government's plans for a "British" Bill of Rights is one such area likely to become a battleground for the competing sides in the EU debate.  The proposal formed a meagre eleven words towards the end of the Queen's Speech with little additional detail from the government - other than to say the rights would be based on those set out in the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), while taking into account UK laws. The lack of detail may help avoid a potentially explosive row over the bill - for now.  But Mr Duncan Smith has attacked David Cameron for abandoning other key legislation, citing a failure to include a planned Sovereignty Bill to re-assert the supremacy of the UK Parliament.  It is another sign of how hard it can be during the campaign to disentangle the usual process of government from the deepening divisions over the referendum.  But despite the challenges for the government, the speech does contain some striking and potentially controversial measures.  Proposals to privatise the Land Registry will provoke a fierce response from unions, which have already raised concerns over thousands of jobs.  The Counter-Extremism and Safeguarding Bill includes stronger powers to disrupt radicals' activities and is likely to provoke strong debate.  The Prison and Courts Reform Bill gives new powers to prison governors to control their own jails, which the government claims is the "biggest reform of our prisons since Victorian times".  The former Home Secretary Michael Howard says all this shows the government "is not distracted by the referendum". That's despite his own opposition to the government's position on remaining within the EU.  These are awkward times indeed for the government - but ones from which attention is deflected for one morning only, thanks to the gleaming regalia of the Queen's Speech.	politics

As part of its Digital Economy Bill, the government promises more protection for children online.  It also pledged more protection for consumers from spam email and nuisance calls, by ensuring direct consent is obtained for direct marketing.  And it reiterated its plans for driverless cars to be tested in the UK.  The Conservative Party pledged in its manifesto to increase protection for children online.  The forthcoming Digital Economy Bill will propose that all sites containing pornographic material must check that users are over 18.  The details of how this will work are not yet clear, and security expert Dr Gilad Rosner, who is a member of the Cabinet Office Privacy and Consumer Advocacy Group, said the government may struggle to implement the plan on free pornographic sites.  Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC, said the issue was "a matter of urgency" and that children who had ready access to adult content could develop a "warped" view of sexual relationships.  According to the government, one in five children aged 11-17 had seen pornographic images that had shocked or upset them.  As part of its Modern Transport Bill, the government wants to "ensure the United Kingdom is at the forefront of technology for new forms of transport, including autonomous and electric vehicles".  It will include legislation to make sure drones and autonomous vehicles are safe and to alter the insurance regime to take account of driverless cars.  Trials of automated cars are currently taking place in Bristol, Greenwich, Milton Keynes and Coventry. and there are more than 60,000 electric cars registered in the UK.	tech

It opened its first bricks and mortar store in Seattle in 2015, with a second to follow this summer in San Diego.  Speaking at its annual shareholders meeting, Mr Bezos also promised new services for Amazon Prime members.  He said he wanted Amazon users to feel "irresponsible" for not signing up to the membership service.  Mr Bezos gave no details about the new services, although it has been rumoured that Amazon plans to launch its own-label food and home products.  Currently users who belong to Amazon Prime, which has an annual fee of £80 ($99), can get unlimited next-day delivery at no extra cost as well as access to a video and music streaming service and e-reader Kindle's lending library.  "Our goal with Amazon Prime... is to make sure that if you are not a Prime member, you are being irresponsible," he said.  "We're definitely going to open additional stores, but how many we don't know yet," he added. "In these early days it's all about learning, rather than trying to earn a lot of revenue."  As Amazon mulls expansion into the real world, struggling clothing retailer Gap has said that it would consider allowing its clothes to be sold on Amazon.  "To not be considering Amazon and other would be - in my view - delusional," said chief executive Art Peck at the company's annual investor meeting in San Francisco.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32816450	Queen's Speech: What is it and why is it important?	The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of the State Opening of Parliament. It is one of the highlights of the Parliamentary year, full of both pageantry and political significance.  What is the Queen's Speech?  In a nutshell, it is a list of the laws that the government hopes to get approved by Parliament over the coming year. By convention, it is announced by the Sovereign in the presence of MPs, peers and other dignitaries in the House of Lords.  The occasion marks the start of the Parliamentary year and has added resonance after a change of government, with the contents of the Speech highlighting the priorities of new ministers and setting the scene for Parliamentary battle ahead.  Has there always been a Queen's Speech?  Traditions surrounding the State Opening of Parliament and the delivery of a speech by the monarch can be traced back as far as the 16th Century. The current ceremony dates from 1852, when the Palace of Westminster was re-opened after the fire of 1834.  There is normally one Queen's Speech every year, although the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government decided against having one in 2011, arguing that its legislative programme was so extensive that it would require two years to implement. The coalition government also decided to switch the State Opening from its traditional November date to the Spring.  Does The Queen write the Speech?  No. It is written by ministers but is delivered by the Sovereign from the throne of the House of Lords on behalf of Her Majesty's government.  The Speech varies in length from year to year, depending on the number of actual bills and other items - such as draft legislation and foreign policy objectives - included but normally takes about 10 minutes.  The Queen, to whom the document is sent beforehand for signing, also uses the occasion to give details of upcoming visits to the UK by other heads of state and any state visits she is making overseas.  Does The Queen come every year?  Pretty much but not quite. This will be the 65th time during her reign that she has delivered the Speech. She has been absent on two occasions, in 1959 and 1963, when she was pregnant. On those occasions, the Speech was read by the Lord Chancellor.  Is there a lot of pomp and ceremony involved?  Yes. The State Opening begins with the Queen's procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster, escorted by the Household Cavalry - an event which always draws large crowds along the route.  The Queen arrives at Sovereign's Entrance and proceeds to the Robing Room. Wearing the Imperial State Crown and the Robe of State, she leads the Royal Procession through the Royal Gallery, packed with guests, to the chamber of the House of Lords.  The House of Lords official known as 'Black Rod' is sent to summon the Commons. The doors to the Commons chamber are shut in his face: a practice dating back to the Civil War, symbolising the Commons' independence from the monarchy.  Black Rod strikes the door three times before it is opened. MPs then follow Black Rod and the Commons Speaker to the Lords chamber, standing at the opposite end to the Throne, known as the Bar of the House, to listen to the speech.  The speech itself is carried into the Chamber by the Lord Chancellor in a satchel. He hands the speech to the Sovereign and takes possession of it again once it has been delivered.  Until a few years ago, the Speech was written on a rare form of calf's skin known as vellum. It is now written on high-quality parchment paper.  What happens after the Speech?  The Queen returns to Buckingham Palace while MPs and peers break for lunch. A couple of hours later MPs reassemble in the Commons to begin debating the Speech.  After introductory speeches by two MPs - traditionally one a relative newcomer and the other a long-serving member - the prime minister gets to his feet to "sell" the Speech to the Commons, explaining what is in it and what it says about his vision for the country and the changes he wants to make.  The leader of the opposition then gets their chance to respond before backbenchers chip in. The debate on what is known as the "Humble Address" normally lasts about five days, with a largely symbolic vote taking place at the end.  Members of the House of Lords also debate the Queen's Speech but do not vote on it.  It is in the Queen's Speech. That means it will happen?  Not necessarily. The Queen's Speech is the equivalent of the government's "mission statement" for the year ahead but that does not mean everything in it will become law.  There are plenty of examples of proposed legislation that falls by the wayside due to political opposition.  A recent high-profile example was a bill proposing elections to the House of Lords in 2012, which was withdrawn four months after being announced by the coalition government.  In contrast, there are bills which are not mentioned in the Queen's Speech which are subsequently introduced in response to changing circumstances.  Traditionally, the first Queen's Speech of a new Parliament tends to contain more bills than later ones as ministers seek to capitalise on the momentum of their party's election victory, at a time when the opposition is often at its most divided.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36316472	Labour's Lady Royall: No life bans over anti-Semitism	People thrown out of the Labour Party for anti-Semitic views should not be banned for life, the author of a report into its university organisations says.  Baroness Royall said people may "change their views" and should be able to apply to rejoin the party.  Her inquiry into anti-Semitism claims at Oxford University Labour Club found no evidence of institutional racism.  But it said "difficulties" had to be addressed to ensure a "safe space" for all Labour students.  A wider inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism, led by civil rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti, is under way.  A Labour spokeswoman said the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee (NEC) accepted the report but shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he disagreed with Baroness Royall, saying the party had to be "extremely firm" on any kind of racism.  He told BBC Newsnight: "I don't want these people to be members of our party, so we have a difference of view on that."  Asked if Ken Livingstone could ever be a member of the party again, following comments he made regarding Hitler and Zionism, Mr McDonnell insisted he would not prejudge the outcome of the wider inquiry.  He added that Baroness Royall's report would now go before the NEC and would influence future policies.  Labour has been beset by growing claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks in recent months, and critics have accused the leadership of not doing enough to combat the problem.  Leader Jeremy Corbyn has said the party has been "resolute" in tackling anti-Semitism and that he has taken "decisive action" over any allegations since he became leader.  Baroness Royall, whose review began before Ms Chakrabarti's was launched, said her recommendations should apply to Labour as a whole in its response to any instances of anti-Semitism.  On banning members, she said: "It is not recommended that where a person is excluded from membership for anti-Semitism this should automatically be a life ban.  "I recognise that people may change their views and that where that is demonstrable a person may be allowed to seek NEC approval for any future application to join the Labour Party."  Her investigation was launched after Alex Chalmers resigned as co-chairman of Oxford University's Labour Club (OULC) after it voted to support Israel Apartheid Week. He said many members had "some kind of problem with Jews".  In a statement the club said at the time: "We are horrified at and whole-heartedly condemn anti-Semitic behaviour in all its forms."  Labour MP John Mann said in a tweet that the report showed there "definitely is" a problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party.  Setting out her conclusion, Baroness Royall said: "I do not believe that there is institutional racism within OULC.  "Difficulties, however, face OULC which must be addressed to ensure a safe space for all Labour students to debate and campaign around the great ideas of our movement."  Ms Chakrabarti's inquiry, set up after MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone were suspended amid anti-Semitism claims, will report by the end of June.  Lady Royall said it should consider whether Labour should change its rules to allow swifter action to deal with anti-Semitism, to empower the NEC with an independent panel to exclude members where there is evidence of anti-Semitism and to introduce more rigorous vetting procedures for candidates.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36279855	How will virtual reality change our lives?	Virtual Reality (VR) has been with us for many decades - at least as an idea - but the technology has now come of age.  And it's not just gamers who are benefiting from the immersive possibilities it offers.  Four experts, including Mark Bolas - former tutor of Palmer Luckey, who recently hand-delivered the first VR handset made by his company Oculus Rift - talked to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the future of VR.  Mark Bolas is a professor at USC School of Cinematic Arts and a researcher at the Institute for Creative Technologies. He has been working in virtual reality since 1988.  VR hits on so many levels. It's a real out-of-body experience, and yet completely grounded in your body.  People have always wanted to master their environment, to extend our agency. We want our hands to be able to do more; that's why we have hammers.  VR allows us to go beyond the limitations of physical tools to do anything that can be computed. If you want to create a two-mile high tower made out of toothpicks, you can do it.  I did a series of 14 different environments; one where you felt like you were very high and had to look down: that was the first time people found this sense of vertigo within a virtual environment. I did a world where you look up towards the sky and see fireworks exploding; that's just magical.  I wanted to build a tool so people could use it. The best way to do that was to stay away from the consumer market because it really wasn't ready, and to go after industrial uses.  So my company created a viewing system that actually meets the specs of modern VR.  Because it had such high resolution, commercial users could use it to solve real problems.  Automobile companies used it for car design. Oil and gas industry used it to visualise data to figure out the right place to sink a well.  The next step was to make these cheap. Consumer VR up until then had a really narrow field of view; it was like looking through a tube of paper. Peripheral vision is really important for a visceral sense, and that's what people really react to.  To find a way to make it low cost and still retain that field of view, we harnessed the power of mobile phones - the screens, tracking and processing - and we figured out a lens design that was extremely inexpensive.  It's been really fun playing all these years, but there's something more important now, which is making it a space that allows us to harness our emotions, our desire to connect with people.  I'm worried by our current computer interfaces. I watch people walking around like zombies with cell phones in their hands, and I have to manoeuvre a mouse to fill out little boxes on web forms in a horribly frustrating way. I think VR will allow us to transcend this.  I don't worry so much about where VR is going, I worry about where we currently are.  Maria Korolov is a technology journalist who has devoted her career to writing about virtual reality.  The biggest way [VR is changing the workplace] is training and simulations. If you have to train somebody on a very expensive piece of machinery, you want to do it in a simulator. The Army, for example, has been an extremely early adopter, as has the air force.  One recent example was a doctor [who] practised surgery on a tiny baby's heart. He took scans of the heart, uploaded them to the computer and toured it with this little virtual reality headset, was able to plan out his surgery ahead of time, and saved the baby.  In education, the biggest change has been Google Expeditions. Google has been seeding elementary schools with over 100,000 virtual reality headsets and lesson plans. Kids are able to go on a virtual reality field trip to, say, the surface of the moon.  Gamers want something visceral. When you're riding a roller-coaster and you go down a hill, your stomach drops out: even though you know it's not real, your body reacts as if it's there. When I showed a shark simulation to people and they screamed, I laughed because, "Ha ha, they're not real." Then I put it on and the shark came at me and I screamed, because it's a physical reaction.  The adult industry is jumping into this with everything they've got because it is so compelling. I have sampled it purely from a reviewer perspective, and it felt like you were in a locker room, and you don't know where to look because everyone's naked, and the lights are too bright, and they're interacting with you. This is going to be big.  The way the internet has changed the way we communicate information, virtual reality will change the way we communicate experiences.  If I wanted to show you what it's like to cook a meal, I could invite you to my virtual apartment and take you through a virtual cooking class. If I wanted to experience a walk in the woods with you, I could take you to my favourite virtual woods.  It will make the world even smaller than it is now. It will increase the ability of people to telecommute and work together across national boundaries dramatically. It's definitely going to bring us closer together.  Psychologist Skip Rizzo is director for medical virtual reality at the University of Southern California. He has been using VR since the 1990s when he became frustrated with the tools available to help rehabilitate people with brain injuries.  I noticed many of my clients were engaged in video games, and people that were very challenged in maintaining attention and focus in everyday activities could focus on those tasks and actually get better.  That was the first light bulb. Could we build virtual environments that represent everyday challenges that would help cognitive rehab?  We started off building virtual environments from video imagery that we had of Iraq and Afghanistan, and talked to a lot of veterans. The environments we created involved riding in a Humvee in a mountainous area, or a desert roadway.  We put somebody in a simulation that is reminiscent of what they were traumatised in, but at a very gradual level so they can handle it. The clinician can control the time of day, the lighting conditions, the ambient sounds.  The therapist tries to mimic what the patient is talking about in their trauma narrative. And eventually by confronting it with therapists, you start to see post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms start to diminish.  We've used VR to help people with high-functioning autism be more effective at job interviews. This involves having them practise their interviews with a wide range of interviewers - different age, gender, ethnic background, and different levels of provocativeness.  We know that the brain is quite good at suspending disbelief, so even though people know these aren't real people, they relate to them as if they are.  This is why VR is so compelling, because whatever is learned in those worlds hopefully will benefit how the person translates their behaviour in the real world.  Nick Yee is a social scientist who studies how people behave and interact in virtual worlds and online games.  We weren't interested in the technology for the technology's sake; the bigger question was using VR as a new platform to study human psychology.  Studies show when we step into virtual bodies, we conform to the expectations of how those bodies appear.  When we're in a more attractive body, we leverage stereotypes we have about how attractive people behave.  People perceive taller individuals as being more confident, and we adopt those norms when we too are given a slightly taller body in virtual reality.  You're more likely to be persuaded by and like a person if you share similar traits, even cues as arbitrary as having the same birthday, the same first name.  Our brains are wired with all these heuristics for who we like, how easily we're persuaded.  VR is uniquely powerful in terms of its ability to manipulate bodies and faces, and hijack a lot of the soft-wiring of how our brain makes sense of the world.  We ran another study where we had a virtual presenter mimic a participant's head movements at a four second delay, while the presenter was giving a persuasive argument, and we found that people are more likely to be persuaded when they are being mimicked.  You can imagine running into a computer agent in the virtual world that sort of looks like you, and has a bit of your mannerisms, and you can imagine how much more persuasive that computer agent could be.  This ability in VR to use algorithms to make [computer agents] more likeable, or their message more persuasive, that's definitely an interesting potential use of virtual worlds.  It absolutely does worry me. We thought about this a lot at the lab. Can people inoculate themselves against these strategies? We were pessimistic. We knew from our own studies that a lot of these manipulations can be subtle to the point of being undetectable, yet still have a measurable impact. It's hard to guard against them.

The deepening divisions in Conservative ranks on Britain's future in the EU were exposed when Lord Heseltine accused Boris Johnson of losing his judgement with "preposterous, obscene remarks".  Mr Johnson had compared the EU with Hitler's desire to dominate Europe.	politics

Diplomats expect Mr Trump to come after his formal nomination as the Republican candidate in July.  Relations between the UK government and Mr Trump are not good, and the prime minister and Mr Trump have clashed.  No request or offer has been made but most presidential nominees travel to show off their diplomatic credentials.  UK Prime Minister David Cameron says Mr Trump's plan to ban Muslims from the US is stupid and wrong. The presumptive Republican nominee says he and the prime minister are not going to have a good relationship.  In December, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."  Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Monday, Mr Trump said: "It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows.  "I hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either."  But that is not stopping ministers and diplomats quietly preparing for Mr Trump to visit the UK in the coming months.  The mood in Whitehall is that the government must now prepare for the possibility that Mr Trump could be the next US president and efforts need to be made to repair relations with the millionaire property magnate.  In 2012, the then Republican nominee Mitt Romney visited the UK and caused some offence by suggesting Britain was not ready for the Olympic Games.  On Tuesday, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan invited Mr Trump to visit him and his family in London to learn about Islam.  He told ITV's Good Morning Britain: "If I can educate the presumptive Republican presidential nominee about Islam, I'm happy to do so."  Government sources say they have been struggling for months to convince parts of Whitehall to take Mr Trump seriously. And they say it is possible his potential rival, Hillary Clinton, could face indictment over the alleged use of private email for government business.  One source described Mr Trump as a political tsunami sweeping up blue collar workers, while Mrs Clinton had not tried to do anything different.  So diplomats are now trying to build a relationship with Mr Trump's team and get ready for the moment they come to the UK.  A petition advocating a ban on Mr Trump coming to the UK after his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering US following the San Bernardino shootings in California in December attracted 574,000 signatures.  In a Commons debate, Labour MP Paul Flynn said barring him from the UK risked being seen as anti-American, but SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said a ban would be justified on the grounds of "religious harmony".	politics

Mr Khan gained 44.2% of first preference votes to Conservative Zac Goldsmith's 35.0%, but how did support for the two men break down at neighbourhood level?  The map below shows how voters in London's wards used their first preference vote for mayor.  In the 630 neighbourhoods mapped, Labour took the majority of the votes in 388. The Conservatives were the strongest party in 242 wards.  Labour and the Conservatives dominated the contest - no other party managed to win on first preferences in any part of London.  Khan or Goldsmith? London mapped by first preference vote share  Labour increased its support in the north and west of the city, compared with the 2012 election, and managed to take a larger share of the vote than the Conservatives in the City of London.  Khan's highest share of the vote - 76.9% - was in Little Ilford, Newham. His lowest levels of support were in Knightsbridge and Belgravia at 12.6% - which coincidentally saw the highest share for Zac Goldsmith at 76.0%.  To see how the mayoral candidates for the Conservatives, Greens, UKIP and the Lib Dems fared use the dropdown menu below.  Mr Goldsmith had the largest share of the vote in west London, as well as a large concentration of support in the north-west and the south-east. However, he struggled to do as well as Labour in much of central London.  Overall voter turnout was higher at this election than in 2012, with 45.3% of people turning out to vote. There were just two neighbourhoods that bucked the trend, both in Lambeth: Bishop's ward, where turnout fell by 4.9 percentage points, and Coldharbour, where it slipped by 1.6.  People turned out to vote in greater numbers in those parts of London that tended to favour the Conservative candidate: the northern and southern edges of the city.  At 62.0% and 59.3%, turnout was highest of all in East Sheen and Kew - two wards where Mr Goldsmith thrashed Mr Khan.  But the ward with the third-highest turnout in London, Dulwich Village, was a better bellwether for the overall result: Mr Khan overturned a majority for Boris Johnson at the last election in 2012.  The ward with the lowest proportion of people voting was Fieldway in Croydon, at 26.6%. This was up on 23.7% in 2012.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36311598	HP reveals high-speed 3D printers with jet fusion tech	HP has unveiled two high-end 3D printers, which it says are up to 10 times faster and cheaper to run than rival systems.  The firm adds that the "multi jet fusion" technology it has developed means its machines can build "superior quality" prototypes.  One expert said the innovation had the potential to be "revolutionary".  But, at present, HP's machines only print in one colour and one material, which will limit their appeal.  The company is hoping to challenge Stratasys and 3D Systems - the two leaders in the 3D-printing industry.  "HP's printers can produce really high-resolution parts at a cost and a speed that blows the competition out of the water," commented Joe Kempton, an analyst at the tech consultancy Canalys.  "Its technology really is a huge step forward and a game-changer.  "What its competitors have, at the moment, is a wider range of materials and the ability to print in multi-colour. But in the long term, HP should be able to close that gap."  Unlike many high-end 3D printers, HP's technology does not use a laser to administer its print material.  Instead, it lays down a thin layer of powder before using a thermal "inkjet" array to introduce an added chemical agent that fuses the material together.  This is repeated layer-by-layer until the object is complete.  The company says its machines can target 340 million points - called volumetric pixels (voxels) - every second.  The caveat is that its first printers to use the tech can only produce goods made from a monochrome thermoplastic.  Competing machines can build models out of metals, various types of plastics, waxes and other materials - sometimes combining different elements together - as well as different colours.  HP's entry-level model is the Jet Fusion 3D 3200, which is about the same size as a washing machine.  It will cost $130,000 (£89,750) when it is released next year. The firm is pitching it as a way to make prototypes.  Its higher-end Jet Fusion 3D 4200 - whose price has not yet been announced - is targeted at customers who also want to be able to turn around "same-day" small-scale production runs.  HP's head of imaging and printing Stephen Nigro told the BBC his company wanted to "move 3D printing from prototyping to production".  He added that future printers would also be able to make ceramic-based objects and multi-coloured items.  Demand for 3D printers is growing but they remain a relatively niche product category.  About 245,000 models were sold in 2015, according to the research firm Gartner.  It forecasts the number will grow to 5.6 million in 2019, although much of that growth will be driven by models costing $2,500 or less.  HP announced it was going to enter the 3D-printing market in 2014, but said it did not want to release a product until it had a "significant" market advantage.  "Competitors have had a significant amount of time to try and adapt and advance their own research," said Mr Kempton.  "However, at the moment there's nothing on the market that is comparable in terms of speed and cost to HP's printers".	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36311668	Random number generator 'improved'	A new method for computer-generating random numbers is being called "remarkable", and could help improve computer security.  Random numbers are important for computer encryption, lotteries, scientific modelling, and gambling.  Researchers said the new method could generate higher-quality random numbers with less computer processing.  The problem of generating random numbers lies in the fact that computers are fundamentally predictable machines, running calculations and delivering answers based on mathematics.  There are currently two main methods for generating random numbers.  In the first, a computer picks numbers according to an algorithm or from a pre-generated list.  This method, while fast and not requiring much computer power, is not truly random, because the results are predictable.  The second method, pseudo-random generation, introduces an unpredictable element from the real world into the algorithm.  This might be a reading of air temperature, a measurement of background radiation, or variations in atmospheric noise.  Some of these measurements, however, have their own patterns - and may not be truly random.  They can also be difficult to acquire.  The new solution takes two "weak" random sources to generate a single, high-quality random number.  That made it a faster, more practical solution for an almost-perfectly random number, said Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University, and it could have implications for encryption and security.  "In cryptography, random numbers are essential," he said.  "Given enough time, all algorithms can be reverse-engineered.  "You have to build the algorithm so that it takes so long to reverse-engineer it's not worth it.  "Random number equations are central to injecting this randomness."  "It's not often that cryptographers and mathematicians get excited... but it does look like party time.  Dr Mads Haahr of Trinity College Dublin, who created the online random number generator random.org, said the development was an improvement in efficiency, but not a fundamental leap forward.  "While the paper might be a good contribution in the specific research area of randomness extraction, I would not call it a breakthrough... all those things are already possible with existing methods and have been for many years," he said.  "If the authors' claims hold up, we will be able to do these things faster than before, and with equipment of poorer quality, which is great, but the method doesn't enable any applications that weren't possible before.  "I'm glad to see there is good research going on to improve the state of the art.  "In many ways, randomness is the under-appreciated cornerstone of data security.  "As regular users of information technology, we tend not to appreciate how important it is."  The new method was detailed in a paper by two researchers from the University of Texas, published online in July 2015.  It has taken almost a year for other researchers to examine its findings, expand upon the method, and for the original authors to add revisions.  The team will now present its research at the annual Symposium on Theory of Computing in June, where it will be one of three recipients of the best paper award.	tech

The Nulled website was a popular marketplace for stolen account details and hacking tips.  The leaked data contained more than 5,000 purchase records relating to the exchange of stolen information.  The site has been taken offline, stating it is undergoing "routine maintenance".  Researchers at Risk Based Security said the data dump contained the "complete forum's database" including 12,600 invoices, usernames, members' PayPal addresses and IP addresses.  It also contained millions of forum posts and private messages detailing illegal activities.  And some of the data could be used to work out members' identities, if they did not take steps to conceal it.  Risk Based Security added the website had used message board software with known vulnerabilities, and the site also used a weak hashing algorithm to protect members' passwords.  The data breach was confirmed by independent security researcher Troy Hunt.  "Data breaches like this remind us that even criminal elements are not immune from having their identities disclosed and released publicly," said Mr Hunt.  "While many of them no doubt took precautions to hide their true identities, inevitably many others will now be feeling very nervous at the prospect of being outed while engaged in fraudulent activities."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36311648	Otto offers retro-fit driverless lorries	A group of former employees from Google, Apple and Tesla has formed a start-up aimed at turning commercial lorries into self-drive vehicles.  Rather than building vehicles from scratch, Otto will make kits to retro-fit existing lorries.  The start-up, which will be self-funded, is betting on autonomous lorries becoming a reality before cars.  Drivers will still be required to take the wheel on non-motorway roads.  Implementing self-driving technology on US motorways is seen as being easier than on other roads or city streets.  Details about when the first models will hit the road and the price of them are not yet available, although Otto has said that it would be "a fraction" of the cost of building a truck from scratch.  The kit will include cameras, radar and lidar sensors which will allow the vehicle to safely keep within a lane, maintain a set speed and slow or stop when necessary. It is unlikely, at this stage, to be able to change lanes.  Driverless trucks are already becoming a reality.  Daimler has tested its Mercedes-Benz lorry on motorways in Germany and has also been granted the first autonomous truck licence in Nevada. In Europe, convoys of semi-autonomous driving lorries from six different manufacturers have travelled across the continent with a driver in the lead setting the speed and route and the other trucks following automatically.  One of Otto's main goals will be to reduce road accidents involving drivers who work long hours.  According to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, there are around 4,000 fatal accidents in the US each year involving trucks or buses. Between 10% and 20% of these are linked to driver fatigue.  Otto is looking for 1,000 truckers to volunteer to have self-driving kits installed on their cabs to fine-tune the technology.  The American Trucking Association, the US trade group for lorry drivers, said it was looking at drawing up a policy for self-driving technology later this year.  "We are paying close attention because this could be huge for trucking in terms of labour costs and safety," Dave Osiecki, chief of national advocacy told the AP news wire.  San Francisco-based Otto currently has around 40 employees, including Anthony Levandowski, who built Google's first self-driving car.  In an interview with technology website BackChannel, co-founder Lior Ron, ex-product boss for Google Maps, said the firm had already completed several tests of a retro-fitted Volvo cab.  "We have driven on a bunch of roads in California and outside, testing the sensors. And we've done driving with a safety driver in the back seat but the truck driving autonomously, and a couple of miles completely driverless without a driver in the back seat at all."  But the firm has greater ambitions, he added.  "We want to get the technology to the point where it's safe to let the driver rest and sleep in his cabin and we can drive for him, exit to exit."	tech

The shadow mental health minister and MP for Liverpool Wavertree said she was "flattered" that people had asked her to stand for the "metro mayor" role.  Another Liverpool MP, Steve Rotheram, is also considering seeking Labour's nomination, the BBC's Arif Ansari said.  Elections for mayor of the Liverpool City Region will be held in 2017.  It will cover five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, St Helens, Knowsley, Sefton and Wirral - as well as Halton in Cheshire.  If they do choose to run, Ms Berger and Mr Rotheram would face competition for Labour's nomination from the current mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, who has already confirmed he will put himself forward.  Ms Berger added: "I will be consulting with family, friends and members of my constituency Labour Party in the coming days, before reaching a decision on whether to put my hat in the ring."  Ministers have championed the idea of regional elected mayors in exchange for the devolution of powers from Whitehall.  Labour's former shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said last week he was considering putting himself forward for a similar role in Greater Manchester.	politics

Ms Bennett said she would not stand for re-election when her second two-year term in office expires this summer.  The Australian former journalist said she intended to remain "fully engaged" in the Green Party after stepping down.  Green peer Baroness Jones and London mayoral candidate Sian Berry have said they do not want the job.  Baroness Jones tweeted that she had "no leader ambitions", while Ms Berry wrote on Facebook that she "definitely will not be standing in the election for a new leader".  Ms Bennett said she had been "proud to lead a party through a period of phenomenal expansion and increased impact".  An ex-journalist who worked for the Telegraph, the Independent, the Times and the Guardian, she became party leader in September 2012.  She succeeded Caroline Lucas, the Green Party's MP for Brighton Pavilion.  Earlier this month, she defended her leadership after the Greens lost four councillors in local elections in England, and won a 2.5% share of vote in the Welsh Assembly elections, behind UKIP.  In a statement, Ms Bennett said: "With the support of our passionate members and supporters we have been able to achieve much in a relatively short period.  "There's greatly increased public understanding that when you want the honest, caring, committed view - one that isn't guided by the views of the latest focus group or fear of a tabloid backlash but by fundamental principles and values."  Ms Bennett took part in televised leaders' debates ahead of last year's general election.  Last year, she had to apologise to members following a radio interview in which she blamed "brain fade" for her inability to explain a series of party policies.  Speaking to the BBC following her decision to stand down as leader, she criticised the "soundbite" culture in politics and the media.  "I'm not smooth," she told Radio 4's World At One.  "Sometimes I get stuck for words. But what I think is, we also need to think about what kind of politics we want. Some of our political reporting is very much aggressive attacks on quite minor points, refusing to engage in the broader issues and that really doesn't do the public, the voters, any kind of favours."  Ms Bennett said she did not know who would run for Green Party leader.  Richard Mallender, chairman of the Green Party Executive, thanked Ms Bennett for "her outstanding leadership over the past four years."  Baroness Jones said it was a "really tough job" and she was "disappointed" Ms Bennett was stepping down.  "What we need now is some new people to come forward," she said. "There is incredible talent in the party who are not well known because they are not elected."  Nominations for Ms Bennett's successor will open on June 1 and close on June 30.  A campaign period will run from 1 July until 24 July, at which point a one-month balloting period will begin with the result to be announced at the party's autumn conference in Brighton in early September.	politics

The five-year plan will see the autonomous cars, vans and buses slowly introduced to the eastern city of Wuhu.  Initially no passengers will be carried by the vehicles as the technology to control them is refined via journeys along designated test zones.  Eventually the test areas will be expanded and passengers will be able to use the vehicles.  "They want to be the first city in the world to embrace autonomous driving," said Wang Jing, Baidu's head of driverless cars, in an interview with the BBC's Click programme.  "This is the first city that is brave enough, daring enough and innovative enough to test autonomous driving," he said.  Mr Jing said the first phase of the trial would last about three years and would involve restricted areas in the city where buses, mid-size vans and cars would be tested.  After three years, the areas of the city in which the autonomous cars can drive will be expanded and the service will be commercialised to allow some of the three million inhabitants of Wuhu to use it.  After five years, he said, the whole city will be open to the driverless vehicles which will mix with human-driven cars, trucks and buses.  Mr Jing said the city was keen to use robot vehicles because they were a much more efficient way to transport people and goods.  The current model in which many households own a car was a "great waste" of resources, he said, because most of the time private cars stood idle. By contrast, he said, robot cars would be much more heavily used.  A study released this week suggested that greater use of driverless cars could promote congestion. The study by accounting group KPMG suggested the robot cars could be used widely by groups, such as the young and old, who do not usually drive thereby increasing the numbers of vehicles on the road.  Mr Jing said he hoped the Wuhu trial would lead to projects elsewhere.  "We are trying to give the experience and data to the central government so they can see the benefit and that will make it easier for us to push to other cities in China," he said. "We hope it will be a starting point that lets us take it to other countries."  Baidu is known to be working closely with German car maker BMW on the development of control systems for autonomous vehicles. The cars emerging from that partnership as well as others made by Chinese car maker Chery will be used in the Wuhu trial.  Many tech firms, including Google, and car manufacturers are also working on control systems for robot cars.	tech

The UK PM has called the Republican hopeful "stupid, divisive and wrong" over his call for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US.  Mr Trump replied by warning he may not have a "very good relationship" with Mr Cameron if he enters the White House.  He is also involved in a spat with new London Mayor Sadiq Khan.  The US presidential contender said he would not forgive Mr Khan for calling him "ignorant" - and challenged the Mayor to take part in an IQ test, an offer mocked by Mr Khan's team.  Last year, Mr Trump, who has beaten his rivals to become the presumptive Republican candidate, called for a temporary halt to all Muslims entering the US in the wake of the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino, California.  He said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  Responding to Mr Trump's comments at the time, Mr Cameron said: "I think his remarks are divisive, stupid and wrong and I think if he came to visit our country I think it'd unite us all against him."  Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier on Monday, Mr Trump said: "It looks like we're not going to have a very good relationship, who knows.  "I hope to have a good relationship with him, but it sounds like he's not willing to address the problem either."  Mr Trump said he was not anti-Muslim but "anti-terror", saying "we have a real problem and we have to discuss it", as he called on Muslims to work with the people and "turn people in" that they suspected of extremism.  "I have many Muslim friends," he said. "I was with one the other day, one of the most successful men, he's Muslim and he said, 'Donald you have done us such a favour, you have brought out a problem that nobody wants to talk about'."  David Cameron's official spokesman was asked about Mr Trump's suggestion that they might not have a good relationship following the Republican candidate's latest comments.  "The prime minister has made his views on Donald Trump's comments very clear. He disagrees with them and I haven't got anything further to add," said the spokesman.  "He continues to believe that preventing Muslims from entering the US is divisive, stupid and wrong."  The Number 10 spokesman said that Mr Cameron was "committed to maintaining the special relationship" whoever wins the presidential election.  "He has been clear that he will work with whoever is president of the United States," said the spokesman.  No proposal had been made for a phone call between the prime minister and Mr Trump, but the spokesman said Downing Street would be willing to consider it.  Mr Trump also criticised what he called the "very rude statements" made about him by Sadiq Khan, after Mr Trump suggested he would make an "exception" to the ban for the London mayor.  Mr Khan, the first directly-elected Muslim mayor of a major Western capital city, dismissed Mr Trump's offer and accused the US presidential hopeful of holding "ignorant" views of Islam which "could make both our countries less safe" by playing into the hands of extremists.  Responding, Mr Trump told ITV: "I am offended, he doesn't know me.  "I think they were very rude statements and, frankly, tell him I will remember those statements," he added.  Mr Trump also challenged Mr Khan to an IQ test.  But as the public spat between the two men continued, a spokesman for Mr Khan said US voters would reject Mr Trump's "ignorant, divisive and dangerous" views.  He said there were "no plans" to seek direct talks with Mr Trump and mocked his IQ challenge, saying: "Ignorance is not the same thing as lack of intelligence."  Mr Khan, who was elected Labour mayor of London last week, told BBC News his message for Mr Trump and his advisors was" your views on Islam are ignorant".  "We've shown in London that there's nothing incompatible with being a mainstream Muslim and Western liberal values, and we showed that comprehensively on 5 May," he added.  Mr Trump, who is the presumptive nominee for the Republican Party after pushing out more than a dozen rival presidential candidates during the US primary season, reiterated that he backed the UK leaving the European Union.  In contrast to US President Barack Obama, who has warned that an EU exit would leave the UK at the "back of the queue" in trade talks, Mr Trump said he did not think it would harm the UK's trade position.  "It wouldn't make any difference to me whether they were in the EU or not," he said. "They certainly wouldn't be back of the queue, that I can tell you."  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson told ITV's Good Morning Britain that it "can't be good" if Mr Trump were to be elected as US president in November.  "I'd agree with that. I have huge and infinite faith in the American people that he won't be," she said.	politics

The group were involved in a fake robbery at London's National Portrait Gallery and a fake kidnapping at Tate Britain in July 2015.  The channel, with 718,000 subscribers, has built a reputation for filming staged pranks around the city.  A fifth member was imprisoned in March following a bomb hoax.  "The hoaxes may have seemed harmless to them, but they caused genuine distress to a number of members of the public, who should be able to go about their daily business without being put in fear in this way.  "We hope these convictions send a strong message that unlawful activities such as these will not be tolerated in London," said Robert Short, of the Crown Prosecution Service.  Daniel Jarvis, 27, Helder Gomes, 23, Endrit Ferizolli, 20, and Ebenezer Mensah, 29 were sentenced on Monday at the City of London Magistrate's Court.  All four pleaded guilty to two counts of using threatening, abusive, or insulting words or behaviour with intent to cause fear of, or provoke unlawful violence for their involvement in the two hoaxes.  For the charge at the National Portrait Gallery, Mr Jarvis was sentenced to 20 weeks, Mr Mensah and Mr Gomes to 18 weeks each, and Mr Ferizolli to 16 weeks. All four were also sentenced to eight weeks for the fake kidnapping at Tate Britain, to run concurrently.  Danh Van Le, a fifth member, was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment in March for his involvement in the fake robbery, and also to 24 weeks for a separate bomb hoax.  "Our aim was never to get away with breaking the law," a member of the group known as Light told the BBC at the time.  Light said the group hoped to continue but would "re-evaluate" their approach.  "We are a big influence and we try to use that positively," he said of the channel's large following.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36304722	Anti-Semitism inquiry leader Shami Chakrabarti joins Labour	The leader of Labour's inquiry into anti-Semitism, Shami Chakrabarti, says she has joined the party in order to gain members' "trust and confidence".  But she said she would investigate "without fear or favour" and her recommendations would be "mine alone".  The inquiry was set up after MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone were suspended amid anti-Semitism claims.  Islamophobia and other forms of racism will also be looked at.  The announcement of the review last month, alongside a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, came as critics claimed the party leadership was not doing enough to combat the problem.  Ms Shah, the MP for Bradford West, was suspended after social media posts emerged in which she suggested Israel should be moved to the United States.  Mr Livingstone was then suspended after claiming Hitler supported Zionism, as he tried to defend her.  Ms Chakrabarti was political neutral in her previous job as head of campaign group Liberty.  Explaining why she joined Labour on the day she was asked to lead the review, she said: "This is a party looking at itself in the mirror and I wanted to have the trust and confidence not just of the Labour leadership but of party members."  She said she wanted members to know the inquiry, which will report by the end of June, was "in the party's interests".  She added: "I consider myself to be independent. I do not think I am less independent for making absolutely clear that I share the values of the Labour Party constitution and will seek to promote those values in any recommendations and findings.  "It is a judgment call but I thought that was the most honest thing to do - to be clear that I was undertaking this because I do believe in the values of the Labour Party and want to see them promoted not just in the Labour Party but in the world."  Labour - along with other progressive parties - had to "openly look at itself in the mirror" and combat not only prejudice but also complacency, she added.  The inquiry will consult Labour members and supporters, as well as members of the Jewish community and other minority groups, she said, and could suggest changes to Labour's rules and procedures.  Ms Chakrabarti said she would seek submissions from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn although she could not compel anyone to give evidence.  Labour peer Baroness Royall - who is already leading a review into anti-Semitism allegations including in the Oxford University Labour Club - and Professor David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the study of anti-Semitism, will be vice chairs.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36302214	UK working on digital driving licence	The UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is working on a smartphone version of its driving licence.  Chief executive Oliver Morley tweeted a photo showing a "prototype" using Apple's Wallet app on an iPhone.  He says it will be an "add-on" to the plastic card rather than a replacement.  Wallet already stores boarding passes and credit, debit, gift and discount cards. Payment information is encrypted end-to-end and authorised with the user's fingerprint or passcode.  CCS Insight analyst Ben Wood said: "Security has taken a significant step forward to support digital payments on phones, so the framework is in place for other secure applications, such as a digital driving licence.  "There are not many people in the UK that do not carry a smartphone with them every day, so it is a logical next step."  Chris Green, technology analyst at the business consultancy Lewis, said digital wallets were "a massively underrated and under-exploited resource".  "People are getting more and more used to the technology because of e-ticketing," he said.  "People are far more comfortable with the concept of keeping key information on their smartphone."  DeLaRue, which prints British banknotes and passports, has already said it is working on a paperless passport.  And the NHS has announced a £4bn plan to move to a "paperless" platform.  Morpho Trust, a US security company that provides driver's licences, has been piloting a digital licence product in Iowa since August 2015.  It says it:  And inn Australia, the New South Wales government has announced the introduction of digital licences, which it says will eliminate the need for a physical card.  The first licences issued under the new system are for fishing, the purchase of alcohol, and responsible gambling.  A driver's licence is due to be available in digital format by 2018.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36301904	Google to phase out full support for Flash on Chrome	Google is planning to phase out full support for Adobe's Flash software on its Chrome browser by the end of 2016.  The technology will only be enabled by default on 10 sites, including YouTube and Facebook. On all others, users will have to choose to activate it.  Flash, which is used for multimedia content, has become very popular with cyberthieves who exploit bugs to compromise web users.  Google follows other browser-makers who have ended support for Flash.  Some of the other sites on which Flash will still be active are Twitch, Amazon and many Russian sites such as Vk.com, Yandex and Mail.ru.  In a message posted on a Chromium-dev discussion forum, Anthony Laforge, Google's technical lead on Chrome, said internal metrics revealed the 10 chosen sites were the most popular Flash-using sites that users visited.  Mr Laforge said the changes would mean that on other sites Chrome would seek to use alternative technologies, such as HTML5, to play video. Where only Flash is available, browser users will be asked if they want to allow the software to run.  Chrome will remember which sites have permission to run Flash so users are not endlessly bothered with pop-ups.  Google said it was also working on ways to ensure that Flash still ran unimpeded when companies used it on internal networks.  Many other tech firms, including Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla, have taken steps to stop Flash running. In 2015, Facebook's security chief Alex Stamos called for it to be killed off once and for all.  However, it still lives on because many sites still make heavy use of it and many games employ it in ways that are hard to replicate with other web technologies.  Shortly before Google announced its plans, security firm Fireeye revealed the latest reported vulnerability in Flash was being actively exploited by cyberthieves. The malicious campaign began only days after the bug was first discovered.  In a blogpost, Fireeye researcher Genwei Jiang said attack code was being included in Flash files embedded in Microsoft Office documents.  Adobe has published patches that stop Flash being used as an attack route via this flaw.  Writing on the Sophos security blog, Paul Ducklin said this was the third time in three months that Adobe had needed to produce patches for vulnerabilities that, if exploited, would let attackers compromise a victim's computer.  He recommended that Flash be uninstalled where possible.  "We need it so occasionally, that we download it every time we need it, install it, use it, then uninstall it altogether and delete it," he said.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36281608	'We need to defend mobility online'	Most people reading this article know the internet as a place with relatively few limits.  You probably have access to a mobile device. You can search for information, read the news, and communicate with people freely.  And you likely learn something new every single day as a direct result of your time online.  But for hundreds of millions of people, the internet isn't so simple.  Our lives are increasingly lived online, yet so little attention is paid to the invisible borders that prevent people and information from moving freely through the world.  Digital mobility isn't a widely examined concept, but it should be.  In many places around the world, individuals are being targeted for their political, religious and sexual identities.  In Iran, where I was born, being gay is a sin, a crime, and the conservative clerics would have you believe it's also a myth.  The state propagates the idea that homosexuality is a manifestation of transsexuality: if you're a man who loves a man, you must be a woman trapped in a man's body. In an odd bit of selective outrage, the government even pays for gender reassignment surgery.  Every day people leave their country of birth or hometown because of homophobic harassment and persecution.  What's so harmful in the case of Iran is the barriers to accessing information — there are gay people in Iran who don't know that being gay is even a concept.  The Iranian government blocks about a quarter of all internet sites, including many that include positive messages about LGBT issues.  That sort of censorship profoundly limits Iranians' digital mobility—and leaves a vulnerable population exposed to grave danger.  Let's take another example: an ISIS fighter who wants to escape the horrors of the caliphate. I recently travelled to Iraq to interview former ISIS fighters —people who just weeks ago had volunteered to be suicide bombers.  I learned that when aspiring fighters arrive at ISIS's headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, they are forced to give up two of their most prized possessions, their passport and their mobile phone — symbols of their physical and digital mobility.  The former fighters described life in the caliphate in stark contrast to the common ISIS narrative of a group of noble warriors fighting for Muslims' rights. The recruits couldn't speak freely, move freely, or use technology.  They were prisoners in every sense. Once the new joiners completed their six weeks of obligatory religious and military training, they got their phones back.  The defectors I spoke with were the lucky ones. They had contacts in a nearby military force who coordinated their escape.  Most people aren't so lucky. If my interviews are any indication, there are many young people who know immediately upon arrival in the caliphate that they have made a huge mistake and that they want to leave, but they don't know how.  They do, however, have access to a mobile phone and wi-fi. It would be a mistake not to exploit this opportunity to reach disaffected members of ISIS.  Although these examples illustrate seemingly isolated cases of life under severe censorship or the deprivation of information, pro-democracy think tank Freedom House reports that, two thirds of the world faces some type of repression.  And more governments than ever are censoring information that is in the public's interest.  It's easy to take each of the above examples as isolated cases, or to make excuses for such oppression as the result of cultural differences. But we shouldn't.  We should regard free access to information and digital mobility as a fundamental right—a right that is as crucial to human liberty as the ability to move from place to place or cross borders.  Fortunately, technology can play a crucial role in undermining repressive governments' attempts to censor and weaponise the internet.  BBC News World On The Move is a day of coverage dedicated to migration, and the changing effect it is having on our world.  A range of speakers, including the UNHCR's special envoy Angelina Jolie Pitt, and former British secret intelligence chief Sir Richard Dearlove, will set out the most important new ideas shaping our thinking on economic development, security and humanitarian assistance.  You can follow the discussion and reaction to it, with live online coverage on the BBC News website.  A small but committed group of developers and companies are creating the next generation of proxies, circumvention tools, and cyber attack mitigation services—technological tools that allow people to access blocked content or protect websites from cyber attack—all of which make it harder for a repressive government to effectively erect borders around its internet.  Achieving digital mobility isn't inevitable, certainly not for the millions of people coming online in repressive societies.  Protecting individuals' right to access information freely requires our constant vigilance and technological ingenuity.

Baroness D'Souza said the Lords "should be free to scrutinise, to question and to hold the government to account".  A review of the Lords was launched after it blocked government plans to cut tax credits in October.  Lord Strathclyde, who led the review, said there was no suggestion the Lords' powers would "fundamentally change".  During the last parliamentary session, the Lords inflicted 60 defeats on the government, including several changes to the housing bill last week.  In return ministers have been clear they are looking into ways of making that harder.  The review recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords has over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead creating a new procedure allowing them to send secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to "think again".  Under the recommendation, they would be allowed to do this only once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagreed.  Baroness D'Souza, who is standing down from the role of speaker in the summer, told the BBC's Sunday Politics: "Obviously we would expect the Lords to want to retain their power to scrutinise... if you start curtailing or eroding or limiting the power of the Lords to do its job, there is a question as to what it is there for."  She said the Lords "should be free to scrutinise and to question and to hold the government to account and to send back legislation it feels is not adequate, either in terms of its clarity or because it infringes the individual liberties we all hold dear".  "There's going to be lively debate about this in the House of Lords and I think there will be a lot of views expressed."  But Lord Strathclyde told Sunday Politics said there was "absolutely no suggestion" the House of Lords' powers would "fundamentally change".  He said: "I made the most mild and humble recommendation about the smallest part of the legislative process on secondary legislation, where frankly most of us had understood that the customs, practice and conventions that had been built over the course of the last 50 years would stick.  "Last October they broke down, as a result of which there is no consensus and no agreement on what those powers should be, which is why I propose not so much a diminution of the powers of the House of Lords but a new power to reject and ask the House of Commons to think again."  Lord Strathclyde added the Conservative government had faced "blocking tactics, using vetoes, rather than working with the House of Commons and the government to try to improve that legislation".  Baroness D'Souza also said she would be pushing for a motion on the issue of reducing the size of the Lords, saying it should not be larger than the House of Commons, and suggesting the number of peers be cut to around 500 from its current 807.  She said she believed at least 20% of peers in the house should be independents or cross-benchers and no one party should have a political majority, adding these changes could be implemented by 2020.  The current size of the House was so large, it was starting to have an impact on the ability of the House of Lords to hold the government to account, the Lord Speaker added.  Sunday Politics will be broadcast on BBC One at 11:00 BST.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36287322	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addresses Progress conference	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has called for inclusivity in the party, as he addressed the annual conference of Blairite group Progress.  Addressing members, who include some of Labour's best-known MPs, he said he was not interested in hearing "personal abuse" but wanted the party to concentrate on "inclusive politics".  Progress was founded by Lord Mandelson to promote New Labour ideas.  It is the first time Mr Corbyn has attended its conference.  He was greeted with laughter when he said: "It is my first time speaking here.  "In fact it's the first time I've ever been invited to a Progress conference - you set a pretty high bar if you have to be elected leader of the party if you ever want to get invited here."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said it was interesting that Mr Corbyn was speaking to some of his fiercest critics - some of whom have been talking privately about trying to get rid of him as leader.  Progress has borrowed Mr Corbyn's "straight talking, honest politics" slogan for its 2016 conference in a further sign it is offering an olive branch to the Labour leader.  Mr Corbyn told members: "I don't do any kind of personal abuse.  "I don't make it and I don't respond to it because if I did I wouldn't have time to do anything else."  He said he wanted more debate as "working together the party can achieve great things".  He added: "I want to see our party even bigger and even stronger but above all united in the fundamental determination to challenge the economic strategy of this government.  "Our party is big, our party has wonderful traditions, our party has people with unbelievable levels of brilliance.  "Working together they achieve a great deal. A democratic policy making process that everyone feels part of and can come into is a very important step forward on this."  He ended by saying the central theme of the party was inclusivity.  He spelt out that this meant "everybody in society actually matters and we shouldn't walk by on the other side because somebody has been so badly treated they end up sleeping on the street and become just a statistic - they deserve to be treated properly and with respect".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell has described it as a "right-wing conservative" group which had never accepted Mr Corbyn as Labour leader.  Speaking in January, after several resignations from the Labour front bench, Mr McDonnell said: "They do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party, based around the organisation Progress largely.  "I don't think they've ever accepted Jeremy's mandate really."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36285648	Assembling Eric: Bringing back the UK's first robot	London's Science Museum has launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund the rebuilding of one of the first robots.  Eric, as it was called, was originally built in 1928, and was the UK's first humanoid robot, impressing audiences with his movement and speech.  He travelled the globe as a showcase for futuristic technology - but disappeared in the 1930s.  Now, the museum is trying to raise £35,000 to rebuild him and has received more than £6,000 in four days.  Eric was created by British duo Captain William H Richards and Alan Reffell. Made mostly from aluminium and weighing 45kg, he could stand, move his limbs and rotate his head.  Perhaps most impressive for the time, Eric could apparently respond to voice commands and "speak" - but only in carefully stage-managed appearances.  "Eric holds a unique place in our history. He was everything we now imagine a robot to be - a talking, moving mechanical person," Museum curator Ben Russell said.  The team behind the project tracked down relatives of Eric's inventor to collect as many documents as possible, including photographs, drawings and technical diagrams.  Working with robotics artist Giles Walker, the plan is to reconstruct Eric as faithfully as possible using modern components.  "It's one of our human instincts to anthropomorphise; we've built machines that look like us," Russell said in an interview with Wired Magazine.  "Robots are almost like mirrors, they reflect back on ourselves, tell us who we are and how we are and what we think is important. When you take that long view you realise the places where you tend to find robots say a lot about the time and why they were important."  Eric was first built at short notice for the London Engineering Exhibition of 1928, when the keynote speaker dropped out of his opening address. Instead, the robot was scheduled to make the opening speech.  Writing about the unveiling at the time, Popular Science Monthly said: "The Thing's enormous size and the stark immobility of his face gave him a really terrifying quality... [the crowd] returned his lifeless gaze.  "They felt subconsciously that here was some strange symbol of relentless Fate itself."  Eric stood up and began his speech as any human might: "Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it gives me great pleasure..."  Robots, at the time, were a relatively new concept. Mechanical automatons had existed for many years, but the term "robot" was coined in a 1920 play "RUR" by Czech writer Karel Capek. Those letters - for Rossum's Universal Robots - appeared on Eric's chestplate.  The mechanical man proved a hit with audiences and Eric went on tour to technology exhibitions across the world, from Germany to New York.  Some time in the 1930s, however, he disappeared without explanation: lost, dumped, or possibly recycled.  If the museum's project is completed, Eric will form the centrepiece of a new robotic exhibition, which is due to run from February to September 2017.  The exhibition will showcase the evolution of modern robotics from a 1582 iron manikin to the toy robots of the 1950s.	tech

Their concerns had stopped them either using online banking or shopping or posting on social media, the survey by a Department of Commerce agency said.  The study asked 41,000 households about their activity in the past 12 months.  A US official said mistrust about privacy was causing "chilling effects".  The agency that carried out the study, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), called for encryption and security to be improved.  The report, based on data collected by the US Census Bureau in July 2015, said 45% of online households had refrained from at least one of the activities identified in the survey, and 30% had refrained from at least two.  Asked about the activities individually, 29% of households responding said they had avoided conducting financial transactions online; 26% avoided buying goods or services; 26% avoided posting to social networks and 19% said they had stopped themselves expressing a controversial opinion on social media because of privacy concerns.  When respondents were asked what concerned them the most about online privacy and security, 63% said identity theft.  The respondents, who were allowed to give multiple answers, also cited credit card or banking fraud (45%), data collection by online services (23%), loss of control over personal data (22%) and data collection by the government (18%); 13% also said they were concerned about threats to personal safety.  The data suggested 19% of US online households had been affected by an online security breach in the previous year. The NTIA said this represented about 19 million American households.  The survey also suggested that households with more internet-connected devices were more likely to suffer a security breach online - 31% of those using at least five different internet-enabled devices were hit by a breach, it said.  "For the internet to grow and thrive, users must continue to trust that their personal information will be secure and their privacy protected," NTIA policy analyst Rafi Goldberg said in a post accompanying the report.  "[Our] initial analysis only scratches the surface of this important area, but it is clear that policymakers need to develop a better understanding of mistrust in the privacy and security of the internet and the resulting chilling effects."  Andy Mulcahy, editor at UK-based online retail association IMRG, said transparency was the key to increasing participation online.  "Businesses often avoid drawing attention to the fact they track data on people, which isn't as underhand as it sounds," he said.  "The nature of how this technology works is that we leave a trail of data whenever we interact with sites, but being more transparent about what they have, how it is used, and why, could actually... build trust."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36284335	Police asked to investigate Conservative election letters	Police have been asked to investigate claims letters sent in David Cameron's name led to a breach of election law.  The former Liberal Democrat MP Adrian Sanders has demanded Devon and Cornwall Police take action.  He said the general election mailshots last year meant the Conservatives had broken local spending limits.  A Conservative Party spokesman said they did not fall under constituency spending restrictions because they did not name the party's local candidate.  The letters repeatedly referred to Torbay, telling voters how important it was for them to back the Tories in that constituency.  One concluded: "The only way you can stop Ed Miliband and the SNP taking us back to square one is to vote Conservative here in Torbay."  The BBC has been shown similar correspondence sent to voters in another seat.  Mr Sanders, who lost his Torbay seat to Conservative Kevin Foster in the 2015 general election, said: "It is a specific targeted mailshot to a voter in a given constituency saying vote for our candidate in that constituency.  "That has to be a local cost, not a national expense."  A Conservative spokesman said: "Simply referring to the location where the elector lives does not promote any named candidate.  "The literature only promoted the national Conservative Party.  "Such literature was not a local election expense under the RPA [Representation of the People Act] regime, as it was not connected with promoting the election of any candidate."  Gavin Millar QC from Matrix Chambers said Mr Sanders had a strong case and claims about election literature could lead to by-elections.  He said: "The law says if you're convicted of the offence of making a false declaration you attract automatically a five-year incapacity for holding public office and that means you must relinquish your seat in Parliament if you're an elected MP."  But Mr Millar, a former Labour councillor, added that other national parties also tended to think they could record similar expenses in their national return.  The Conservative agent in Torbay at the general election responsible for reporting local expenses, Alison Hernandez, has since been elected as the local police and crime commissioner.  Devon and Cornwall Police have asked West Mercia Police to investigate earlier allegations of undeclared spending - made after an investigation by Channel 4 News into visits by a Conservative Party campaigning "battle bus".  The Conservative Party has acknowledged that, owing to an "administrative error", some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.  Ms Hernandez has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. She denies any wrongdoing.  The law which governs local election spending - the Representation of the People Act - defines election expenses as those incurred "with a view to, or otherwise in connection with, promoting or procuring the candidate's election at the election".  The Electoral Commission has previously said such letters are "generally reportable" under national spending limits, but the final position depends on specific "facts and context".	politics

The interior designer, 56, has received undisclosed damages, an apology and reasonable legal costs from the group, it was revealed in London's High Court.  Ms Hoppen's solicitor, Henry Fox, said the group had admitted in February to unlawfully intercepting phone messages.  The group said the method - which resulted in articles between 2004 and 2006 - should never have been used.  Ms Hoppen appeared on BBC Two's Dragons' Den for two series before quitting the show in January 2015.  She is also the former stepmother of Sienna Miller, whose past relationship with fellow actor Jude Law was of huge interest to the tabloid media.  In 2011, Ms Hoppen accepted £60,000 in damages over a separate phone-hacking case involving the now-defunct News of the World.  Ms Miller's phone was also hacked by the paper and in 2011 she received £100,000 in damages.  Mr Fox said a separate claim brought against Mirror Group Newspapers by Hilary Perrin - who from 2000 to 2006 was director of regional organisation for the Labour party and also director of the London Labour Party - had also been settled with the payment of damages, costs and an apology for the damage and distress caused.  He said Ms Perrin's voicemails had been hacked in February, March and April 2004 and she was also targeted by private investigators on two occasions.  Ms Perrin had never sought publicity and was distressed to think the paper had potentially jeopardised her political career by intercepting private messages left by those who had placed their trust in her, he added.  Ms Waite said that Mirror Group Newspapers acknowledged Ms Perrin's information should never have been obtained or used in the manner it was.  Neither Ms Hoppen nor Ms Perrin were in court.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36285643	Zuckerberg: Facebook investigating censorship claim	Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has said the company is investigating claims it censored news reports with conservative viewpoints.  It follows a week of allegations in the media and discussion in the US Senate.  The tech news website Gizmodo had said Facebook staff suppressed articles on conservative topics from the site's "trending" news section and "injected" others, even if they were not trending.  Mr Zuckerberg said Facebook had found no evidence the report was correct.  "Facebook stands for giving everyone a voice," he wrote in a post.  "This week, there was a report suggesting that Facebook contractors working on Trending Topics suppressed stories with conservative viewpoints. We take this report very seriously and are conducting a full investigation to ensure our teams upheld the integrity of this product."  He said if any evidence of "anything against our principles" was discovered "you have my commitment that we will take additional steps to address it".  Mr Zuckerberg said he was inviting leading conservatives to meet him to discuss their views.  Gizmodo's original report alleged that staff tampered with trending topic stories and were told to include stories published by the BBC, CNN and other mainstream news organisations ahead of smaller news sites.  It said the trending topics section was run like a newsroom, with curators able to "blacklist" or "inject" topics.  The report was followed by a release of documents to The Guardian, which appeared to show editorial decision-making by Facebook staff, alongside the company's algorithm, to determine what is trending.  Stories pulled from mainstream news organisations by the editorial team are called "external" topics, the documents say, and are gathered via feeds from 1,000 media sources.  These sources include the BBC, Reuters and many national newspapers, as well as smaller popular sites.  The criteria for marking a story as having "national" importance required that it be the lead on at least five of 10 websites: the BBC, CNN, Fox News, The Guardian, NBC, New York Times, USA Today, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, Yahoo News or Yahoo.  Blacklist tools, the documents say, were only to be used for two reasons: where a story did not relate to something that actually happened, or where a story was duplicated.  Facebook had been coming under increasing pressure to make its processes more transparent before the release of documents to The Guardian.  Republican Senator John Thune, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, asked if the company was misleading the public about its news features.  "Social networks such as Facebook are an increasingly important source of news for many Americans and people around the world," he said.	tech

The warning about the second attack came from Swift, which oversees the financial messaging network that underpins global money transfers.  Swift said the target was a commercial bank but did not name the organisation or reveal if any cash had been taken.  The attack used techniques and tools resembling those used to steal cash from Bangladesh in February, it said.  Swift is used by about 11,000 financial institutions around the world to move large amounts of cash.  The attackers had a "deep and sophisticated knowledge of specific operational controls" at the targeted bank, and could have been aided in their theft by "malicious insiders", said Swift.  In both attacks the thieves sought to submit fraudulent messages to the Swift network to transfer large amounts of cash to accounts they controlled.  Analysis of February's attack suggested the gang aimed to steal about $1bn by moving cash from an account held by Bangladesh's central bank at New York's Federal Reserve to other accounts.  A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted staff and stopped much of the money going astray.  The second attack showed that the Bangladesh theft was not an isolated incident but "part of a wider and highly adaptive campaign targeting banks", said Swift.  It added that its core network remained secure despite the attempts by cyberthieves to manipulate it.  In April, Swift released software updates that it said would help customers improve security.  An investigation into February's attack revealed that the cyberthieves won access to the central bank network because of poor security controls.  The bank had no firewall, which is designed to block unauthorised access requests. It also used second-hand internet routers, which had cost $10, to connect to global financial networks.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36280481	Is technology becoming less disruptive?	The Brooklyn Cruise Ship Terminal opened in 2006 - the same year that Twitter launched.  So, you'd think that when one of the tech sector's biggest events - TechCrunch Disrupt New York - moved to the birthplace of hipsters, that cutting-edge development and a good amount of facial hair would be on display.  But this year's New York Disrupt didn't seem very disruptive.  TechCruch's biggest Disrupt conference in San Francisco, its London version, and past New York events have always attracted innovative technology developers.  Jordan Crook, senior writer for TechCrunch, was unconcerned by what seemed to be a slow burn in the sector, even in areas like virtual reality and artificial intelligence.  "It's easy to see with hindsight that what seemed to be a slow transition was really a massive shift," she says.  Take the technology for drones, which started as toys. Over the last year this has shifted and drones are being used for farming and policing and are being tested by companies like Amazon for delivering packages.  SeaDrone, a finalist in Disrupt's start-up battlefield, is using drones to improve fishing.  But along "start-up alley" many companies seemed focused on disruptive ideas from the past like dating apps, search engines and coffee-makers.  Tony Xu, the creator of delivery company Door Dash, pushes back on the idea that there is limited disruption going on.  "You need to understand your segment of the market," he tells the BBC.  His company connects people looking to order food from local restaurants with "dashers" - ordinary people who can collect and deliver food from restaurants that don't typically offer this service.  "Delivery isn't novel, but we claimed this space," he adds.  Since 2013 Door Dash has given the 85% of US restaurants that don't deliver, the opportunity to participate in this market. Mr Xu points out disruption doesn't have to be totally new, simply changing the way we think a certain industry operates is enough.  Connecting riders with taxis didn't seem that novel when it launched. Uber's success - connecting drivers and passengers in a given area and allowing them to pay via their phone - has spurred hundreds of businesses to copy the model for other industries.  K. Kavi Raj, founder of app development company On Demand Bay, saw this as his chance for innovation.  "When Uber became big we got a lot of requests for similar apps, so we thought we should come up with something ready-made," he explains.  His company has sold mobile platforms to companies all over the world, helping to launch an "Uber" for tutors, for delivering alcohol and for musicians.  One of the most disruptive things about tech start-ups has been their ability to change the way we do everyday tasks and there was a big focus on that at the conference.  For example, Dog Parker offers dog owners piece of mind for a small fee. The company puts dog houses outside shops so owners can ensure their pets are safe while they are inside.  Peloton is looking to break into the fitness industry with a stationary bike that allows users to follow a gym class on a tablet screen in real time at home and to track and compare their performance.  For cyclists keener to be out on the streets, Lumenus is looking to solve the issue of limited visibility. The company sells jackets and backpacks with LED lights linked to the user's smartphone. The lights flash to indicate where the cyclist will be turning, based on directions from Google Maps.  New York's Disrupt was not devoid of exciting announcements.  Dag Kittlaus, the creator of Siri, launched his newest project Viv. The artificial intelligence (AI) platform acts like a digital assistant acting on voice instructions.  With an instruction like "order flowers for Mother's Day" Viv would find mum's address in the contacts list, figure out the date of Mothering Sunday, connect with flower delivery sites and send them a customer's payment details.  The winners for the start-up battlefield, Beam, found their niche in the gaming industry.  The company hopes to capitalise on the growing market of gamers who watch each other play online. Its founders developed a platform where users can interact directly on the games they are watching through crowdsourced controls.  "While this may seem like a slow burn I think it's just another step and we will look back at 2016 and say this was the year of a lot of development," says Ms Crook.  It is worth remembering too that New York is not the best barometer of transformation for the tech sector. Start-ups in New York tend to focus on the industries already established in the city.  But it is too soon to tell whether 2016 turns out to really be a year of transformation or if the time of disruption is over.	tech

On Thursday, a report citing a source within Apple said suppliers in Taiwan should expect fewer orders.  The pace of iPhone sales has slowed, particularly in Asia, and there are no major new product releases scheduled.  The tech giant is vying with Google's parent firm, Alphabet, for the title of the world's most valuable company.  Alphabet claimed the most valuable company spot in February after reporting its 2015 financial results, but had fallen back below Apple in the following weeks.  Shares of Apple have been falling since April after the company's first-quarter earning report showed slowing demand.  "People are getting negative data points about component orders and production forecasts, and the features on the new iPhone do not seem to be a big change from the 6S," said Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang.  Apple's stock price fell 3.3% to $89.47 during afternoon trading, leaving its market valuation at $494bn. However, it later recovered slightly, closing 2.4% down at $90.34.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36271515	Conservative Party releases election expenses after court action	The Conservative Party has produced documents about its spending during the general election after the Electoral Commission took court action.  The watchdog applied to the High Court to force the party to disclose the documents, as part of an investigation into an alleged spending rules breach.  Within hours, the commission said it had received the documents from the party and was reviewing them.  The allegations relate to accommodation costs of activists on its "battle bus".  The Conservative Party acknowledges that due to an "administrative error" some accommodation costs for the activists may not have been properly registered.  It says the bus tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative campaign headquarters and the costs would not have breached national spending limits, as it says it was "some millions below the national spending threshold".  But others argue that spending ought to have been declared under the local campaigns, in constituencies where the battle bus and its activists visited .  On Thursday, Lincolnshire Police joined a list of police forces investigating whether election spending for candidates was not properly recorded.  The police probe will ascertain whether the expenses for the people using the bus should have been filed by the MPs' agents in their local expenses.  The case has also led to calls for the new police and crime commissioner for Devon and Cornwall to stand aside while she is investigated over her part in the campaign.  The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said it will review allegations that Alison Hernandez failed to declare expenses as an election agent in Torbay in the 2015 election. She has denied any wrongdoing.  In a statement, the Electoral Commission said: "Using its powers under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act (PPERA) 2000, and in line with its enforcement policy, the Electoral Commission may issue a statutory notice requiring any person, including a registered party, to provide us with specific documents and/or information as part of an investigation.  "This places the recipient under a legal obligation to provide the required material.  "However, if the recipient does not comply with this statutory notice, the commission may apply to the High Court for a disclosure order which if granted would be the court compelling the respondent to release the required documents and information to the commission."  The commission said the Conservatives had failed to act properly on two statutory notices requiring it to produce information - providing "limited disclosure of material in response to the first notice (issued on 18 February 2016) and no material in response to the second notice (issued on 23 March 2016)" - despite being granted extensions to the original deadlines to comply.  Prior to receiving the information, the commission's Bob Posner said: "We are today asking the court to require the party to fully disclose the documents and information we regard as necessary to effectively progress our investigation into the party's campaign spending returns."  A Conservative Party spokeswoman said the party had advised the Electoral Commission on 29 April "that we would comply with their notices" by 13:00 on 12 May.  "There was no need for them to make this application to the High Court," the spokeswoman added.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36276671	Photoshop gets 'Shazam for fonts' artificial intelligence tool	Photoshop is to use artificial intelligence to help users identify typefaces they have seen elsewhere.  Developer Adobe describes its DeepFont feature as "Shazam for fonts" - a reference to the song-recognising app.  It will work on both the mobile and desktop versions of the image-editing software, but users will need a Creative Cloud subscription.  One expert said the tool would probably be popular with professionals, who often struggle to identify a design.  Other font-matching online services already exist, but Adobe suggested the machine learning technology behind its system gave it an edge.  The US company's announcement was timed to coincide with its digital marketing summit in London.  Adobe first revealed it was developing a point-and-click way to identify fonts last year, but waited until now to confirm its rollout.  The process is carried out remotely on the company's computer servers.  They use an algorithm that looks at the curves and other characteristics of the selected text and then compares them to a database of about 20,000 fonts.  The algorithm has been trained using millions of images to spot similarities, so does not need to find a direct match.  This means that it works with screenshots, photos of printed examples and even scribbled sketches.  "You highlight the text area that you are interested in being recognised, and it will give you a list of the top five fonts that match what you highlighted," Anil Kamath, head of the company's data science team, told the BBC.  "That applies to an image that you can take with your phone.  "So, you might write something on a white board, take a picture of it and ask the software to suggest fonts that it corresponds to."  The results include typefaces created by third parties as well as those in the Adobe Type library.  One expert said the challenge of identifying fonts came up "surprisingly regularly".  "I can attest first-hand to seeing groups of designers sitting around trying to figure out what's that font," said Clive Howard, an analyst at Creative Intellect Consulting, who previously worked at a design studio.  "They often have an existing website or are given a flat file - a JPeg image or a printed thing - and the client doesn't know what font the original design agency used.  "I've also seen designers come in in the morning having stolen one of the ads you see on the Tube, and then sit around trying to work out the font because they think it's cool and want to use it.  "Sometimes you can't use a typeface for commercial reasons, so then it would be great to know what fonts are similar."  Design professionals already have access to products, including Fontspring's Matcherator, WhatTheFont and Fonts.com's Search by Sight, which attempt to solve the problem by other means.  But Mr Howard said the integration of DeepFont into Adobe's software should give it an added advantage.  "Having to fish around for a separate tool and figure out how it works is always going to be challenging, so having a feature within the software designers already use is a benefit," he said.  "Adobe's creative tools are pretty much locked in as industry standards.  "But it's still important that the firm adds new capabilities because we've seen other software-makers sit on their laurels thinking they are the only game in town, and they haven't lasted."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36275930	New York blogger reveals parking ticket errors	A blogger in New York has used public data to prove that the New York Police Department (NYPD) ticketed thousands of cars that were actually parked legally.  Ben Wellington made the discovery after officers kept ticketing his own car, parked on a pavement ramp on the street where he lives.  Drivers have been allowed to park on some of these spaces since 2009.  The NYPD wrote to Mr Wellington to confirm his findings and sent a message to officers clarifying the rules.  To discover the extent of the problem, Mr Wellington examined data published through New York City's Open Data portal, which includes information on the most common parking places in the city where tickets are issued to cars on pedestrian ramps.  He then checked some of the locations via Google Street View to ensure that the ramps were not connected to a crosswalk - in which case the ticket would have been justified.  At one spot in Brooklyn, $48,000 (£33,000) had been issued in erroneous fines over a two-and-a-half year period.  Mr Wellington detailed several examples on his blog, I Quant NY, including three more spaces at each of which more than $40,000 (£27,500) in fines had been given out over the same period.  "It was a surprising find," Mr Wellington told the BBC. "What I was actually most surprised by was the response from the police department who basically said, 'yep, that's all true' - that's an unusual thing to happen when working with public data."  In a statement, the NYPD said: "Mr. Wellington's analysis identified errors the department made in issuing parking summonses.  "It appears to be a misunderstanding by officers on patrol of a recent, abstruse change in the parking rules.  "We appreciate Mr Wellington bringing this anomaly to our attention."  It added that while traffic agents had been trained following the adoption of new rules in 2009, officers hadn't.  A message has now been sent to all officers updating them on pedestrian ramp regulations.  To allow others a means of quickly checking which pedestrian ramp parking spaces are most frequently ticketed, Mr Wellington has plotted the 1,000 most common locations on an interactive map.  "I think all those spots got eight or more tickets in the last two-and-a-half years," said Mr Wellington. "The list of five or more tickets had about 2,000 spots."  Mr Wellington has used open data in the past to challenge ticketing decisions in the city.  He said he hopes his latest success will help to empower fellow citizens.  "I see it as a sign of what the future of government could look like as more data gets out and more citizens have the ability to look through that data and make recommendations for how cities could run better," he said.  Mr Wellington added that he plans to do a follow-up analysis six months or a year from now, to check whether the number of erroneously issued tickets at pedestrian ramps has fallen.  Use of public data in cities around the world has increased in recent years.  The Future Spaces Foundation think tank, based in London, recently reported on how much transport data had been made openly available in various cities around the world.  For example, there are now more than 460 apps powered by Transport for London data while, in Singapore, commuters are able to access information on the current levels of standing room and seating available on public transport.  The city's Land Transport Authority app also includes data on the availability of parking spaces near to a passenger's destination.	tech

Stockbroker Peter Hargreaves told Reuters the UK would "become incredibly successful" as it "will be insecure again - and insecurity is fantastic".  The Remain campaign said his comments showed Leave campaigners were "willing to risk making families worse off".  The UK was "stronger and better off" in the EU, director Will Straw said.  The UK votes on whether or not to remain a member of the European Union in a referendum on 23 June, with the economy one of the key battlegrounds in the campaign.  Remain campaign Britain Stronger in Europe says the UK economy will shrink and jobs will be lost if Britain withdraws from the EU - but Leave campaigners says the economy would thrive as it would be free of what it calls EU red tape and able to negotiate trade deals with other countries.  In an interview with Reuters news agency, Mr Hargreaves - who has donated £3.2m to Leave.EU, a group founded by UKIP donor Arron Banks which lost out to Vote Leave in the race for the official designation - said a vote to leave would create uncertainty in the UK.  But he argued that was what the country needed, saying it "would be the biggest stimulus to get our butts in gear that we have ever had".  "It will be like Dunkirk again," he said. "We will get out there and we will be become incredibly successful because we will be insecure again. And insecurity is fantastic."  Mr Hargreaves, who founded investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, criticised some of the "bizarre" EU regulation Britain's financial services and business were subject to, saying it was set by people "who have never been to Britain and wouldn't know how to spell financial services".  He stepped down from the board of the company last year, but still owns a stake of more than 30%. He was speaking in a personal capacity.  Green MP Caroline Lucas, on the board of Britain Stronger In Europe - the official Remain campaign - said remaining in the EU would ensure the UK enjoyed "continued prosperity as part of Europe".  "Insecurity might be exciting for billionaire hedge fund managers like Peter Hargreaves, but for most people in Britain it risks jobs being lost, prices rising and small businesses being hit.  "It also risks our hard won rights at work and the environmental protections which keep us safe," she said.  The group's executive director, Will Straw, said Britain was "stronger, safer and better off in Europe than we would be on our own".  "These out-of-touch remarks from the Leave campaign's biggest donor show they simply do not care about the damaging consequences for people's jobs, family finances and Britain's economy," he added.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36276754	India to ban unofficial maps and satellite photos	India is introducing legislation to ban maps or satellite images of the country unless they are approved by government.  The new bill, which would affect digital maps from Google, Apple, and Uber, is facing stiff opposition from campaign groups.  The government said the rules would not create barriers to business if the bill became law.  The bill bans all types of geospatial information, maps, raw data or photographs, acquired by any means, including satellite photography.  Offenders could be fined up to 1bn rupees (£10.4m).  It also requires anyone who has already gathered such information to apply for a licence to keep it.  It was designed to regulate both the creation and distribution of geospatial information in India "which is likely to affect the security, sovereignty and integrity" of the country, the Ministry of Home Affairs said.  Critics say the definition of geospatial data is so wide it could include printed maps, world atlases, or depictions of the country in international magazines imported to India.  The proposed law is likely to cause problems for Apple and Google's map products, as well as services offering "value added" geolocation services, such as taxi-hailing app Uber.  It is also unclear if companies such as Google would have to go through a separate vetting process every time they updated their satellite imagery - a process that takes up to three months.  There is an exemption for government agencies and departments.  Google already offers slightly altered versions of its maps inside India, eliminating the Line of Control that divides Indian-controlled and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir and locating the whole disputed region within India's borders.  Both Google and Uber declined to comment.  Anyone creating, distributing, or owning unsanctioned maps must apply to a government agency for a licence, and submit the material for inspection.  The geospatial data will then be considered by a security vetting committee, which will decide if the applicant is granted a licence.  Once the material is cleared, it must be watermarked with the insignia of the vetting authority.  "It's only a draft proposal before the country," the Minister of State for Home Affairs, Kiren Rijiju, said in a tweet. "I would appeal not to pass hasty judgment, but put up your suggestions."  Speaking to the Economic Times, he said: "It is a general concern being raised that India as a responsible country must have provisions to secure its boundary and territory.  "That is why the bill is necessary.  "It is not a question of sending a message to any firm or company - but it is a question of addressing our own security concern."  In a country where the number of people owning a mobile phone is rocketing, providing online maps is a big and growing business.  If this bill goes through, no-one, from Google to the smallest business, will be able to run their map services in India without a licence.  The government will control how anyone uses online maps.  When I want to book a cab using a taxi app service, I'm sharing my location with the service to find a cab.  The driver uses a map to navigate.  When I take a picture and upload it with metadata, I'm creating mapping information that would require a licence.  A growing protest online, with the hashtag "#savethemap", claims the bill won't just hurt individuals, but also small businesses.  Campaigner Sumandro Chattapadhyay says companies such as Uber and Google will survive by getting all their maps vetted by the government.  "But smaller companies have no means to know what kind of geospatial information they can store and what they cannot," she says.  "Moreover, if a start-up requires three months to get approvals for your data before you can use it, it'll be as good as dead."  The bill also bans the publication of such material outside the country, and is designed to apply to citizens of India living and working in other countries, explicitly stating offenders outside India will be subject to the same penalties.  "This act needs to be dropped," said managing editor Arup Dasgupta, in a post on Geospatial World magazine's website.  "This act does not, in fact cannot, even begin to comprehend the paradigm shift in geospatial technologies which makes it a non-starter.  "India does need a geospatial information act, but it has to be an enabling and encouraging act that makes for faster and better implementation of programmes, not a regressive and punitive act as the proposed one," he said.  The bill is still in the draft stage, and government is inviting submissions on it until 4 June.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36268581	YouTube defended in row over music royalties	A prominent online video star has defended YouTube in a row over the way the site treats musicians.  The company said it had faced a "chorus of music label representatives and artists" accusing it of "mistreating" songwriters and performers.  Hank Green, a prominent video producer and entrepreneur, said YouTube gave musicians "new revenue streams".  The row comes as the video-sharing website renews its agreements with major record labels.  Prominent voices in the music industry have accused YouTube of paying low royalties for music video streams and turning a blind eye to copyright infringement.  In March, the Recording Industry Association of America said YouTube paid "meagre" royalties when compared to subscription music services such as Apple Music and Spotify.  On Monday, music manager Irving Azoff, formerly in charge of Ticketmaster and who now represents artists such as Christina Aguilera, said artists were paid a "pittance" on the advertising-funded site.  In an open letter, he said YouTube did not allow musicians to put their tracks behind its YouTube Red pay-wall to earn more revenue.  He also accused YouTube of "hiding behind" a so-called "safe harbour" provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which stops websites being held responsible for copyright infringement by users, in some circumstances.  Trying to keep copyright music off YouTube was "an impossible, expensive game of 'whack-a-mole'," he said.  "When the artist sends a 'take down' it should be a 'stay down'."  YouTube said comparing subscription services to free advertising-funded websites was "like comparing what a cab driver earns from fares to what they earn showing ads in their taxi".  In a blog post, the company said it paid "a majority" - more than 50% - of its advertising income to content creators and the music industry.  However, it added that the average YouTube user listened to only one hour of music a month, compared to the 55 hours a month it said Spotify subscribers consumed.  The company said its Content ID technology could detect when copyright music was uploaded to the website and automatically dealt with 99.5% of copyright claims.  It said record labels had the choice of whether to earn advertising revenue from unauthorised uploads or have them blocked indefinitely, and that half of the $3bn (£2bn) it had paid out to the music industry came from monetising these "unauthorised uploads" by the public.  Income from its subscription service YouTube Red, available in the US, was shared with content creators and musicians in the same way as advertising revenue.  YouTube has been separately criticised by video-makers who say Content ID does not respect the "fair use" of television and film extracts, which is protected by a provision of the DMCA.  It has attempted to address the problem by allowing disputed videos to earn advertising revenue which is kept until the correct copyright holder can be identified.  Hank Green, co-founder of the world's biggest online video convention VidCon, described YouTube's Content ID technology as a "win-win" situation for record labels.  "[Record labels] can take the video down, or they can claim the revenue for themselves... this is not an expensive game of 'whack-a-mole', it's 100% automated," he wrote in a reply to Mr Azoff.  "They've been given a new 10-figure revenue stream of claimed fan creations that they never would have had without YouTube."  Singer Dave Giles, a regular performer at YouTube events, said musicians did benefit from advertising-supported streams on the video site.  "It was interesting that when Taylor Swift took her songs off Spotify, she kept them on YouTube," he told the BBC.  "If it wasn't really helping her career, surely she should have taken them off there as well.  "Spotify might be paying more per stream than YouTube, but they have more subscribers. There's an argument that YouTube should be doing more to push its subscription model, but they are still rolling it out.  "It's still more than artists get on Facebook. Where's Mr Azoff's email about that? Why is YouTube facing the rap and Facebook not?"	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36275547	Traceable data 'stolen from fetish forum'	A hardcore fetish web forum has been hacked, with more than 100,000 accounts exposed, according to a prominent security researcher.  Troy Hunt runs Have I Been Pwned?, a database of stolen user accounts dedicated to informing victims.  The data from the latest breach, which includes email addresses, usernames, IP addresses and passwords, reveals sexual proclivities people may not want known.  It included government and military email addresses, Mr Hunt said.  The site had been using out-of-date software that had made the hack attack fairly simple, he said.  "It took advantage of a common vulnerability using an SQL injection," Mr Hunt said.  A SQL injection is a type of security exploit in which an attacker adds structured query language (SQL) code to a web form, allowing them to send requests to databases that could allow them to download the entire database.  According to Mr Hunt, 37% of the accounts were already listed on Have I Been Pwned?  The Have I Been Pwned? database currently contains more than 345 million hacked accounts from more than 100 websites.  None of them is publicly viewable.  Instead, it acts as a notification site for users who think their data may have been breached.  They enter their email address to find out whether their account is among those hacked.  In this particular case, Mr Hunt said the exposure of data could be particularly sensitive because of the nature of the site.  "This is a forum where you would think people would want to stay private, but people were using traceable emails or even corporate emails," Mr Hunt told the BBC.  He advised people who wanted to visit such sites to consider taking steps to remain anonymous.  "Create an email account and make up a name and use something like the Tor browser so the IP address can't be traced back to you," he added.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36275537	US Congress 'bans members' Yahoo Mail'	A series of ransomware attacks on the House of Representatives has led US Congress to ban members from using Yahoo Mail, according to a leaked email.  Both Yahoo Mail and Gmail are named in the 30 April email, published on Thursday by Gizmodo, saying the attacks had increased "in the past 48 hours".  Yahoo Mail will be blocked "until further notice" it adds.  Ransomware encrypts victims' files and demands a ransom be paid for unlocking.  Meanwhile, an unnamed House of Representatives employee has told Reuters devices connected to the internet via its wi-fi or ethernet cables have been barred from accessing appspot.com, the domain where Google hosts custom-built apps.  "We began blocking appspot.com on 3 May 3 in response to indicators that appspot.com was potentially still hosting a remote access Trojan named BLT that has been there since June 2015," the news agency was told.  Reuters' sources said the FBI had originally warned Congress of the potential vulnerabilities.  Former House of Representatives employee Tom Henderson told Reuters two Google-hosted apps he had created to allow members of Congress to discuss politics and share notifications about votes had been hit by the ban.  Both Yahoo and Google said they were working with Congress to resolve the issue.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36273499	Vote Leave anger at ITV over Farage EU debate choice	Vote Leave is considering legal action after ITV decided to put Nigel Farage up against David Cameron in an EU referendum TV special.  The official Leave campaign had wanted one of its senior figures - Michael Gove or Boris Johnson - to take part and claimed No 10 had "set the rules".  ITV rejected claims of a "stitch up", while Mr Farage, UKIP leader, said Vote Leave should "put their egos aside".  Downing Street says the PM will not debate against other senior Tories.  A spokesman said this was because the EU referendum, on 23 June, was about much more than "who's up and who's down in the Conservative Party".  Live televised debates featured in the 2010 general election, with the three contenders for prime minister - David Cameron, Gordon Brown and Nick Clegg - taking part.  That format was not repeated at the 2015 general election. But after protracted discussions between Downing Street and the broadcasters Mr Cameron took part in one with seven party leaders but no head-to-head with Labour's Ed Miliband.  In the run up to the in-out referendum on Britain's EU membership, ITV plans to hold two TV specials, including an hour-long live programme in which Mr Cameron and Mr Farage will appear one after the other to separately answer questions from a studio audience.  Vote Leave is the official campaign for those wanting the UK to leave the EU - a status it was given by the Electoral Commission after it saw off a challenge from the Nigel Farage-backed Grassroots Out.  Its best known campaign figures are senior Conservatives such as Boris Johnson, Mr Gove and others like Iain Duncan Smith - and the thrust of its campaign seeks to be broader than the more immigration-focused UKIP approach.  Vote Leave's head of media, Robert Oxley, told BBC Radio 4's Today that while Mr Farage had done a "tremendous amount" in the referendum he was not the best person to win over undecided voters.  But Mr Farage disagreed, telling the BBC he could better appeal to voters in the Midlands and the north of England than Mr Johnson who he said was more suited to the "home counties".  Criticising the decision not to include one of its senior figures, a Vote Leave spokesman said ITV had allowed the prime minister "to dictate his own opponent".  "The government has set all the rules for the referendum to give itself every possible advantage. It has also demanded of the broadcasters that the prime minister should not have to debate representatives from the official Leave campaign," the spokesman added.  This row matters because it highlights once again the central dispute amongst those wanting the UK to leave the European Union: is Nigel Farage an asset or a liability to their cause?  Vote Leave think he will put off those who are yet to decide who to support - and so are livid that the UKIP leader will appear on the same ITV programme as the prime minister at the beginning of next month.  They wanted Boris Johnson or Michael Gove to appear instead.  But it's long been thought Downing Street would be reluctant for David Cameron to be seen to be so publicly at odds with cabinet colleagues.  In other comments a Vote Leave source on Wednesday accused ITV of having "lied to us in private while secretly stitching up a deal with Cameron".  The source said ITV had "effectively joined the official In campaign and there will be consequences for its future", saying "the people in No 10 won't be there for long".  And a Vote Leave spokesman said on Thursday: "We are discussing legal possibilities to increase the chances that the public will hear the issues properly discussed before they make such an important vote on the future of their democratic rights."  Responding to the criticism, ITV said in a statement that it had "not lied to anyone, nor has there been any kind of 'stitch up'".  A spokeswoman said Vote Leave had been invited to take part in a separate two-hour programme on 9 June and would have "every opportunity" to air its view.  The ITV statement added: "It was our editorial decision as to who would take part in the 7 June programme; the PM called the referendum, and the country wants to hear from him, and Nigel Farage has been a leading proponent of an exit from the EU for more than 20 years and his party received 3.8m votes at the election. We invited them both and they accepted.  "We think our viewers will find both programmes useful in providing information ahead of polling day. Our programming will, as always, be fair, balanced and duly impartial."  Meanwhile, Mr Farage accused Vote Leave "apparatchicks" of trying to block him from appearing on the TV debate and said they were "more interested in their careers" in the Conservative Party after the referendum.  "I have consistently tried to bring our side together. They have consistently tried to marginalise UKIP and divide us. They need to put their egos to one side," he told the BBC.  In an appeal for "unity", he said he would work with anybody, within reason, to secure a vote to leave on 23 June.  Mr Farage also accused the BBC of barring him from its planned TV debates, which include a live event at Wembley Arena on 21 June.  Number 10 says David Cameron will not debate against senior Conservatives who back EU exit, saying it does not want the TV debates turned into a "blue on blue fight".  "This is a major national debate and it should not be reduced to a narrow argument within the Conservative Party.  "We don't want it to become an issue of who's up and who's down in the Conservative party or seen just through the prism of the Conservative party," a source said.	politics

Lord Ramsbotham said 30% of prisoners, some 25,000 inmates, could be freed.  And Bob Neill, Conservative chairman of the Justice Select Committee, said prisoner numbers in England and Wales needed to be cut straight away.  Justice Secretary Michael Gove has said he will not artificially "manage down" the prison population.  And the Conservative former Justice Secretary Ken Clarke said reforms would not fully succeed until the prison population was reduced.  Plans for prisons are expected to feature in the Queen's Speech next week, setting out the government's planned legislation for the year ahead.  Asked whether prisoners needed to be released before any of Justice Secretary Michael Gove's reforms were put in place, Lord Ramsbotham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Absolutely. He can't possibly do it with the numbers as they are now."  The cross-bench peer said some prisoners on indeterminate sentences for public protection and those who are mentally ill should be let out, adding that he estimated 30% of inmates did not need to be in prison.  He said he supported the aims of the government's planned reforms, first spelt out by the prime minister earlier this year.  Ken Clarke, justice secretary between 2010 and 2012, said: "The reforms will not fully succeed until you reduce the prison population. You can do things if you have more sensible sentencing for people who aren't hardened criminals."  And Mr Neill said he strongly supported the government's reform proposals but added: "I think we should be looking to start reducing the prison population straight away."  But a fellow Conservative on the committee - Philip Davies - said a "ridiculously low" percentage of criminals were jailed. He asked: "Are we going to have rapists, murderers, burglars out of prison?"  Mr Gove has said he will not artificially "manage down" the prison population, believing his reforms will mean less reoffending and lower numbers over time. However, he has said "we should make changes within the current population".  In a speech on prison reform in February, the prime minister said the justice system should better address prisoners' illiteracy, addiction and mental health problems. He pledged to give prison governors more autonomy and to publish data showing how well or poorly prisons performed.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36272269	David Cameron sorry over 'IS' cleric comment	David Cameron has apologised for "any misunderstanding" after describing a former imam as a supporter of the Islamic State group.  He accused Suliman Gani in Parliament of backing the militant group as he questioned Sadiq Khan's judgement in sharing a platform with him.  Mr Gani has said claims he backs IS are defamatory and must be retracted.  At Prime Minister's Questions in April, Mr Cameron said Mr Khan had appeared on a platform nine times with Mr Gani, whom the prime minister alleged "supports IS".  Mr Gani said at the time that he wanted to take legal action against Mr Cameron but was unable to do so because of Parliamentary privilege rules, which protect MPs' freedom of speech in the Commons.  In a statement, Downing Street said Mr Cameron was referring to reports that Mr Gani supports "an" Islamic state.  A Number 10 spokesman said: "The prime minister is clear this does not mean Mr Gani supports the organisation Daesh and he apologises to him for any misunderstanding."  Several senior Conservatives attacked Mr Gani at the height of the London mayoral race and accused Mr Khan - who was elected London Mayor last week - of associating with extremists, an approach which Labour said was illustrative of a "divisive, dog-whistle campaign".  Mr Fallon apologised for an "inadvertent error" in labelling Mr Gani an IS sympathiser. He made the claim about the Tooting preacher during a BBC interview, as he defended the Conservatives' London mayoral election campaign.  In a message on social media last month, Mr Gani said he had "condemned IS wholeheartedly" since its inception and that it in no way represented his beliefs. He wrote: "Saying I support Islamic State is untrue and highly damaging to my reputation.  "I am totally opposed to so-called Islamic State which I view as a terrorist and inhumane organisation. Indeed as an imam and community leader, I have campaigned against the evils of Islamic State to my fellow Muslims and to others in the community."  Dr Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain welcomed the "long overdue apology", but said "such smear-by-association has become all too common for Muslims and Muslim organisations".  "For the real extremists we are all opposed to, such tactics will only provide fresh new examples of a society not willing to accept Muslims for who they are," he said.  He called for the prime minister and the defence secretary to repeat their apologies in Parliament, and for an "urgent review" of Islamophobia in the Conservative party.	politics

The PM said the countries' leaders were "battling hard" to tackle the problem.  It comes after he was recorded talking to the Queen at Buckingham Palace.  An Afghan official said "bold" action had already been taken while Nigeria's president said he would not be demanding an apology from the PM.  Asked ahead of the anti-corruption conference in London if Nigeria was "fantastically corrupt", Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, who came to power last year on a promise to fight corruption, replied: "Yes."  Mr Buhari said he was more interested in the return of stolen assets held in British banks, adding that corruption in Nigeria was endemic and his government was committed to fighting it.  "What would I do with an apology? I need something tangible," Mr Buhari said, referring to efforts to recover the money.  The Afghan embassy in London said tackling corruption was one of President Ghani's top priorities and "bold" action had been taken.  "We have made important progress in fighting systematic capture in major national procurement contracts and are making progress on addressing institutional issues as well as issues related to impunity... therefore calling Afghanistan in that way is unfair."  Mr Cameron's original comment about the two countries came while he was speaking at an event to mark the Queen's 90th birthday about hosting world and business leaders at this week's anti-corruption summit in London  "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain... Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world," he was caught on camera saying.  Mr Cameron was asked about his comments during Prime Minister's Questions, where he jokingly checked his microphone was working, referred to "tips on diplomacy" and said he had made "many unforced errors" in the past 24 hours.  Answering a question from Tory backbencher Philip Davies - who asked why UK aid was being given to countries the PM sees as corrupt - he praised the action taken by Afghanistan and Nigeria and warned cutting off aid could "come back to haunt us here".  He also defended action by his own government, including on overseas tax havens and measures to make sure "plundered money from African countries can't be hidden in London".  In the footage showing Mr Cameron's comments, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intervened to say: "But this particular president is not corrupt... he's trying very hard," before Speaker John Bercow said: "They are coming at their own expense, one assumes?"  Earlier, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the PM had been "merely stating a fact" in his comments, and ex-London mayor Boris Johnson said people would "find it refreshing he was speaking his mind".  In Transparency International's 2015 corruption perception index, Afghanistan was ranked at 167, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea, Nigeria was at 136.  Transparency International said the success of Thursday's summit would be judged on whether concrete action was agreed on tackling tax evasion and secrecy in the wake of the Panama Papers disclosures, stopping tainted firms from bidding for public contracts and protecting whistleblowers who expose corruption.  US Secretary of State John Kerry - who is representing the US at the summit - said the fight against corruption should be made a global priority "of the first order".  "Today the cost of corruption globally is exploding, and it's exploding everywhere," he told the Oxford Union. "Despite recent progress, as a global community, we just are not doing nearly enough to eliminate this scourge - and that needs to change."  Labour has suggested a Tory government "hosting an anti-corruption summit was like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop".  "The government is refusing to take meaningful action to close Britain's constellation of tax havens, which together constitute the largest financial secrecy network in the world," said shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott.	politics

A spokesman for the defence secretary said: "He naturally apologises for this inadvertent error."  Mr Fallon was among senior Tories to attack Mr Gani during London's mayoral campaign and accuse Labour's Sadiq Khan, who shared a platform with him, of associating with extremists.  Mr Gani has said claims he backs IS are defamatory and must be retracted.  After winning the London Mayoral election, Mr Khan, the first Muslim to hold the post, accused the Conservatives of running a "divisive, dog-whistle campaign".  Mr Fallon made the claim about Mr Gani during a BBC interview, as he defended the Conservatives' London mayoral election campaign.  In a tweet after the interview was broadcast, Mr Gani indicated he would be seeking legal action against the defence secretary.  When asked about the legal letter issued by Mr Gani's lawyers, a spokesman for Mr Fallon said: "Michael made clear he was quoting a claim by Andrew Neil on a BBC Mayoral debate programme.  "He was unaware of the clarification and apology that the BBC had issued on Neil's claim.  "Had he been aware, he would not of course have quoted him and as soon he became aware he put the record straight. He naturally apologises for this inadvertent error."  Prime Minister David Cameron has faced calls of his own to apologise for criticising Mr Gani in Parliament.  At Prime Minister's Questions in April, Mr Cameron said Mr Khan had appeared on a platform nine times with Mr Gani, a preacher whom the prime minister alleged "supports IS".

The woman, who had been using the smartphone app Periscope, reportedly jumped under a train at a station about 25 miles (40 km) south of Paris on Tuesday.  The video is no longer available on Periscope, which is owned by Twitter.  Twitter said it did not comment "on individual accounts".  According to French newspapers, the young woman died in Egly, Essone at about 15:30 GMT on 10 May.  Previously, she had filmed herself in her flat discussing how she intended to make a video to "send a message", warning younger viewers not to continue to watch what would be a "shocking" act, it was reported.  During the filming, the young woman claimed to have been raped and named her attacker, according to the reports.  The death is currently being investigated and the data on the young woman's phone is being looked at, said local prosecutor Eric Lallement.  It is not the first time that Periscope has been linked to inappropriate content.  In April, a woman from Ohio was charged with streaming the rape of a teenage girl via the app. She denied the charge.  Periscope has strict guidelines about content that is allowed and also provides a link to allow users to report issues.  It does not monitor the feeds around the clock, although it has previously said that it was able to respond "within minutes".  The Samaritans helpline is available 24 hours a day for anyone in the UK struggling to cope. It provides a safe place to talk where calls are completely confidential.  The Survivors' Trust provide support and signposting for women, men and children who are survivors of rape, sexual violence or childhood sexual abuse.

The series allowed players to add new characters and challenges to the game by using a special dock with real-world toys.  It was initially launched in 2013, and released its third major version in August 2015.  Disney said the game did not perform as well as expected, and that it would stop publishing its own console games.  News of the change, which will see future Disney games produced under licence, came in an earnings report published by the company. The closure of Disney Infinity was also confirmed by John Blackburn, the division's head.  Figures released in the report showed a $147 million charge "in connection with the discontinuation of our self-published console games business, principally Infinity".  The game studio behind the series, Avalanche Software, is expected to close as a result.  Disney also shut down video game studio LucasArts when it acquired the Star Wars franchise, choosing instead to develop Star Wars games under licensing agreements.  Users on the Disney Infinity's official forums and social media accounts expressed their disappointment at the news.  "It may seem silly, but this was horribly upsetting to my children," wrote one customer. "They simply love this game and have collected almost all the figures."  Others called for the company to continue supporting the game's online features for existing customers.  Games analyst Steve Bailey, from IHS technology, said toy-to-life games like Disney Infinity or competitor Skylanders tended to begin well, but faced challenges in generating repeated sales.  "We saw a similar thing happen back in 2008 or so, with music games like Rock Band and Guitar Hero," he said.  "The early traction that brought the segment to prominence was difficult to maintain, and so things quickly lost momentum.  "It's this expectation of creating ongoing freshness that's bearing down on the toys-to-life market. I suspect that the costs involved in keeping Disney Infinity competitive became too risky for the company."  Disney said it will release two final products for Infinity - Alice Through the Looking Glass, due in May, and a Finding Dory set to coincide with that film's release in June.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36266632	Malware parasites feed on PerezHilton.com gossip fans	The gossip news site PerezHilton.com has exposed recent visitors to malware, according to a cybersecurity alert.  California-based Cyphort Labs said that it had detected ads placed on the site being used to spread harmful code on two separate visits during one week.  The celebrity scandal site has not yet commented but was known to have suffered a similar problem last year.  The phenomenon is known as "malvertising", and users do not have to click on the ads to find their device infected.  PerezHilton.com is far from being the only publisher to have hosted the threat.  Cyphort identified 1,654 unique domains that had fallen victim to the parasitical attack in 2015, and said it believed it was on course to see more than 2,000 instances this year.  The New York Times, AOL and BBC.com are among other popular sites thought to have been hijacked in this way. since January.  "Malvertising is effective because users tend to trust mainstream, high-trafficked "clean" websites," security researcher Nick Bilogorskiy blogged.  "The attackers abuse this trust to infect them via third-party ad content."  PerezHilton.com says it is visited by 12 million people every month.  In the first instance on 30 April, the firm said PerezHilton.com's ads caused users to download the Angler exploit kit, which is used to distribute a range of infections including ransomware.  Then on 2 May, it said a different type of exploit kit was spread via the site.  If the users had anti-virus software installed they may have been protected against some of the threats. But in many cases they would not have known they had been exposed.  Like many sites, PerezHilton.com does not check each advert that appears on its pages but instead relies on third parties to place them, sharing the revenue they generate.  "The only organisations which understand the full scale of the threat are the advertising networks themselves, and they don't want to draw attention to their own failure to vet their clients," commented Dr Steven Murdoch, a security expert at University College London.  Cyphort noted that users could protect themselves by installing ad-blocking extensions for their web browser.  Dr Murdoch concurred but questioned whether this was a long-term solution.  "Ad-blockers offer a temporary mitigation against these problems but if everyone starts using them the current business model of the web will no longer be sustainable," he said.  "Other options for keeping the web running include asking users to pay for services - subscriptions - but few websites have been able to make this work."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36263256	Gordon Brown says quitting EU would not be British	Gordon Brown has thrown his weight behind the campaign to stay in the EU, claiming it is "not British to retreat to Europe's sidelines".  The former prime minister argued that Britain needed to be in the EU to shape the continent's responses to terrorism, immigration and climate change.  And it was "not in tune with the Churchillian spirit" to "disengage".  Leave campaigners said Mr Brown's arguments "rang hollow" given his "disastrous record" while in office.  The British public will decide in a referendum on 23 June whether to remain in the EU or to leave.  With just over six weeks until the vote, campaigning has been stepped up by both sides. In other EU referendum developments on Wednesday:  In a wide-ranging speech at the London School of Economics, Mr Brown invoked Britain's history of standing up for human rights and fighting fascism and anti-Semitism.  He said the EU referendum should be an opportunity to make the positive case for Europe and the UK's "outward looking internationalism" and said Labour voters were more likely to respond to positive arguments for staying in.  The Remain campaign, he added, would have to secure the backing of Labour, Lib Dem and SNP voters if they were going to win - and the campaign should stress the benefits to ordinary people of EU membership over pay, working conditions and employment rights.  He echoed Prime Minister David Cameron's comments about the EU's role in preserving peace and stability.  "For 1,000 years nations and tribes of Europe were fighting to the finish and murdering and maiming each other. There is no century except this one where Europe has been at peace and nations... were not vying for supremacy," he said  But for the last 70 years since World War Two, nations now "battle with arguments and ideas" and not "with weapons and armaments".  "It is like we have not just exchanged swords for ploughshares, we have made it possible so that people never think that swords will be used again."  There are two silent concerns inside strands of the Labour Remain camp.  First that the focus on the economic message, Project Fear as it's nicknamed, isn't enough.  And second, Labour voters who might be a bit fed up with the EU but are reluctantly supportive might not turn out to vote.  During the Scottish independence referendum Mr Brown's last minute fiery political sermons were a shot in the arm for the Unionists.  He is intervening now (as ever) on his own terms, but the former prime minister's interventions this time might have some effect.  In the first of a series of planned speeches in the run-up to polling day, the former Labour leader said: "If this referendum is about anything it is about what kind of Britain we are and what kind of Britain we aspire to become.  "We should be a leader in Europe, not simply a member. We should not be fully out and we should not be half out. We should be fully in.  "We should recognise that the world has changed since the first referendum and we should be advocates for cooperation in an inter-dependent world."  In a question and answer session afterwards, Mr Brown said the EU was moving to a "more flexible" model, adding: "The future lies in a united Europe of states rather than a United States of Europe.  "Too much cooperation and people will feel their identity is at risk, too little cooperation and it will not be possible to solve the economic, social and environmental problems we face."  Ahead of his speech, Mr Brown used articles in the Mirror and the Guardian to argue that Britain must be at the heart of European policy making.  Mr Brown, who has been credited with stopping Britain joining the euro when he was chancellor in the 1990s, told the Mirror the British must stop being "reluctant Europeans" and shape the continent's responses to terrorism, immigration and climate change.  "I think most people would agree that it's not British or in tune with the Churchillian spirit to simply disengage when Ukraine is in turmoil. It is not British to retreat to Europe's sidelines when there is a common fight against illegal immigration and terrorism," he wrote.  "It is certainly not British... to allow ourselves to be on the periphery when important defence and security decisions are made, not only in Nato but in the European Union."  In a separate article for the Guardian, Mr Brown urges the EU to use its clout to take concerted action against tax havens.  In response, a Vote Leave spokesman said: "Gordon Brown was in a government that gave away part of our rebate and opened our borders across the EU. Lessons on the patriotic case for the EU will ring hollow from a prime minister with such a disastrous record in Europe."  Boris Johnson kick-started a UK-wide bus tour in Cornwall, a part of the country that has historically been eurosceptic.  Mr Johnson said of his Remain opponents: "They think they have got the big battalions because they have the taxpayers' money.  "We have got the passion, we have got the commitment.  "Let's make June 24 independence day for Britain," he cried, waving a pasty handed to him by a well-wisher.	politics

The designs have been presented to the Unicode consortium, the body that approves and standardises emojis.  The team said that they hoped the samples would "empower young women (the heaviest emoji users) and better reflect the pivotal roles women play in the world".  Emojis are icons that are increasingly being used in mobile and web messaging to help tell a story.  The term - which means picture (e) and character (moji) in Japanese - was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2013.  The team of four Google employees cited a New York Times op-ed called "Emoji Feminism" as the motivation for its new designs.  "Where, I wanted to know, was the fierce professional working her way to tenure? Where was the lawyer? The accountant? The surgeon?" asks Amy Butcher in the piece.  "We are told we are the new generation of American women; no longer a minority, we are, in fact, the majority of breadwinners in American homes. And yet the best we can get is the flamenco [dancer]."  Research by Procter & Gamble suggested that 82% of girls aged 16-24 use emojis every day. More than half of those surveyed thought that female emojis were stereotypical.  Google's designs include women in technology, construction, farming and the food industry. The female musician emoji includes a homage to the late David Bowie - with a pink zig-zag on her face.  Users can already select from different skin tones as well as the generic yellow on some devices.  Recently Emojipedia, a search engine for emojis, proposed that you should also be able to choose the colour of hair and specify gender.  All emojis need to be approved by Unicode to make sure that they display properly across the different platforms.  However, emojis can look very different on competing platforms - a dancer emoji for instance shows up as a ballerina on LG phones, a man disco-dancing on Samsung devices, a yellow blob with its arm raised on Android and a flamenco dancer on iOS.  The next batch of emoji candidates is due to be released mid-year but it is unclear whether Google's designs will be approved in time to be included in this.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36259851	AI patient app launched at Alder Hey hospital	Staff at Alder Hey children's hospital in Liverpool are teaming up with IBM Watson to develop an app to help patients and doctors work better together.  The app will answer any questions which parents and children may have about their hospital stay.  It will also allow children to create a profile so that clinicians know things such as their favourite colour.  Later, it may be used to offer insights into treatments.  Watson is an AI platform that is already advising doctors on treatments in a dozen cancer hospitals in the US, trawling through data - it can read 40 million documents in 15 seconds - to offer insights into possible treatments.  It may eventually do similar things at Alder Hey but is starting with a more simple patient/doctor app, designed to make hospital visits run more smoothly.  The hospital is working with the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council's (STFC) Hartree Centre on developing the app.  For the next few months, hundreds of Alder Hey patients and their parents will be asked a range of questions on everything from parking, to what they would like to eat, to their favourite games and films, and what they want their bedroom to look like.  They will also be asked what questions they have about clinical procedures, general anaesthetic, and surgery. A team of experts from the Hartree Centre and IBM, will use this information to train "Watson" to anticipate and respond to questions from patients and families before they come into hospital.  Mr Iain Hennessey, a paediatric surgeon and director of innovation at Alder Hey, told the BBC: "Helping our patients and their families prepare properly for coming into hospital will really reduce their anxiety and could mean we can get them better and home faster.  "So much of medicine is about looking after people. It is roughly a third of what we do and it is a neglected part. How we communicate with patients hasn't changed much over the last 100 years. A leaflet is seen as cutting edge and a website of patient information is award-winning."  He said that later, the platform may offer "more hardcore diagnostics" but said governance around using patient data was "a nightmare".  "I wanted to get this off the ground quickly and using patient records takes time, is costly and can cause controversy. Alder Hey is famous for caring and that's what I wanted to build on."  Future applications could include summaries of patient notes, spotting trends across the hospital and the AI could even be used to offer treatment and care options.  IBM's European director for Watson, Paul Chong, commented: "I'm thrilled to see IBM Watson technology applied to help doctors and their patients in the effort to improve the lives of children and their families."	tech

The National Environment Research Council defended its decision to hold a public poll to suggest names, in which Boaty McBoatface got the most support.  Professor Duncan Wingham said the row had "put a smile" on people's faces.  But MPs asked if he would be made to "walk the plank" by ministers, who named it after Sir David Attenborough.  Prof Wingham was giving evidence to the Commons Science and Technology Committee about the episode, which attracted huge public interest and divided opinion after Boaty McBoatface was passed over.  He said that ministers' decision to name the vessel after the eminent zoologist and broadcaster - the option which came fourth in the poll - while allowing Boaty McBoatface to live on by naming a remotely operated sub-sea vehicle after it was an "eloquent compromise".  Asked by Conservative MP Nicola Blackwood what the episode had done for public engagement in science, the academic said it had attracted "extraordinary attention" which could only be regarded as an "incredible success".  "We could make the claim that we are probably the best-known research council in the world," he said.  "We could make the claim that because of that there are hundreds of thousands of people, not only in the UK but around the world, who know about us and the science that we have done  "In many ways we feel this has been an astonishingly great outcome for us.

Pay of such "connected parties" has also risen at twice the rate of other staff, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) found.  The group called for a review of whether MPs should be allowed to employ relatives in the future, arguing jobs must not be "personal benefits".  In total, 139 MPs employ family members at a public annual cost of about £4.5m.  The review will only apply to future staffing as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) said it would be "unfair and legally challengeable" to investigate existing contractual arrangements.  The watchdog, which is responsible for determining MPs' pay and expenses, said there was a lingering "perception of risk" about whether the taxpayer was getting value for money in terms of the number of family members and close business associates working for MPs.  After reviewing the matter in 2010, Ipsa decided against prohibiting the employment of family members, saying it did not believe the system was being abused and family members played a "valuable role" in assisting MPs - while limiting their numbers to one per MP.  The watchdog said it was still happy with the majority of contractual arrangements but believed that controls preventing the misuse of funds were "limited". Since relatives generally occupied more senior roles it found they were paid "significantly more" than other staff.  "Public concern about the employment of connected parties has remained," it said.  "In order to determine whether these constitute any grounds for concern, Ipsa would need to undertake intrusive and potentially disproportionate work to investigate the employment practices in MPs' offices.  "But, given that there remains a perception of risk to taxpayers' money, we are obliged to address it. Therefore we are consulting again on the practice, but only in respect of the employment by MPs of any new staff."  The issue will be considered as part of a wider review of business costs and expenses payable to MPs - with any change to the rules likely to take effect either next year or after the next election, scheduled for 2020.  Ipsa is also looking into the £4.4m cost of paying off staff who worked for the 182 MPs who retired at the last election or lost their seats.  While all the sums were within the rules, it expressed concern that £975,000 was paid to 125 staff who were taken on by newly elected MPs within the subsequent 10 weeks - "sometimes in the same constituency and in the same role".  As MPs are all separately self-employed, it said the election represented a "legal break" in the staffers' employment but it noted that in other areas of the public sector the rules had been changed to prevent staff from getting pay-offs if they are soon taken on in a similar field.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260193	David Cameron calls Nigeria and Afghanistan 'fantastically corrupt'	David Cameron has described Nigeria and Afghanistan as "fantastically corrupt" in a conversation with the Queen.  The PM was talking about this week's anti-corruption summit in London.  "We've got some leaders of some fantastically corrupt countries coming to Britain... Nigeria and Afghanistan, possibly the two most corrupt countries in the world," he was overheard saying.  Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, elected last year after vowing to fight corruption, said he was "shocked".  And a senior Afghan official said the characterisation was "unfair".  After Mr Cameron's comments, Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby intervened to say: "But this particular president is not corrupt... he's trying very hard," before Speaker John Bercow said: "They are coming at their own expense, one assumes?"  The conversation took place at Buckingham Palace at an event to mark the Queen's 90th birthday, attended by political leaders and other public figures.  At a garden party later on Tuesday, the Queen herself was caught on camera making unguarded comments about the Chinese government.  She told a senior police officer that she had heard the Chinese had been very rude to Britain's ambassador to China during President Xi's state visit last year. The Queen also agreed that the Chinese state visit had been a testing time for the police and told the officer it was "bad luck" that she had been in charge of security at the time.  On the face of it, it is perhaps one of the most undiplomatic things a prime minister could say - to describe two countries as fantastically corrupt just hours before their leaders visit Britain.  The prime minister's remarks were outspoken and unguarded but they were not untrue. Both Afghanistan and Nigeria come high on lists of the world's most corrupt nations.  And later in the conversation, the prime minister agreed with the Archbishop of Canterbury that President Buhari of Nigeria is not corrupt himself and is trying very hard to tackle the problem.  A Downing Street spokesman noted both men had written openly about the subject in a collection of essays being published this week.  So this was a truthful gaffe, another moment when the prime minister was caught on camera saying something ostensibly embarrassing.  Labour said Mr Cameron had egg on his face. But, as Downing Street acknowledged, the cameras were very close to the prime minister and his anti-corruption summit is now very firmly in the headlines.  In Transparency International's 2015 corruption perception index, Afghanistan was ranked at 167, ahead of only Somalia and North Korea, Nigeria was at 136.  With his remark, the archbishop was believed to have been referring to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari, who won elections last year promising to fight widespread corruption.  In response, Mr Buhari said his government was deeply "shocked and embarrassed" by the PM's comments. Speaking through his spokesman, he suggested that Mr Cameron must be referring to Nigeria's past notoriety for corruption before his coming to power last year.  The Afghan embassy in London said tackling corruption was one of President Ghani's top priorities and "bold" action had been taken.  "We have made important progress in fighting systematic capture in major national procurement contracts and are making progress on addressing institutional issues as well as issues related to impunity... Therefore calling Afghanistan in that way is unfair."  No 10 said the presidents of Nigeria and Afghanistan had "acknowledged the scale of the corruption challenge they face in their countries".  The government will host world and business leaders at the summit on Thursday in London, aiming to "galvanise a global response to tackle corruption". Speaking ahead of the summit, Mr Cameron said: "For too long there has been a taboo about tackling this issue head-on.  "The summit will change that. Together we will push the fight against corruption to the top of the international agenda where it belongs."  But Labour said a Tory government "hosting an anti-corruption summit is like putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop".  "The government is refusing to take meaningful action to close Britain's constellation of tax havens, which together constitute the largest financial secrecy network in the world," said shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott.  Transparency International said the UK's record was mixed and concrete action was needed on tax evasion and secrecy in the wake of the Panama Papers disclosures, stopping tainted firms from bidding for public contracts and protecting whistleblowers who expose corruption.  Last year Mr Cameron was recorded talking about Yorkshire people "hating each other" - and he was previously caught revealing how the Queen "purred" with pleasure when he told her the Scottish independence referendum result.

The firm already offers access to professional TV shows and films via Prime Video, a rival to Netflix.  It also streams user-generated clips about video games via Twitch.  "There are more options for distribution than ever before and with Amazon Video Direct, for the first time, there's a self-service option for video providers to get their content into a premium streaming subscription service," said Jim Freeman, Vice President of Amazon Video  "We're excited to make it even easier for content creators to find an audience, and for that audience to find great content."  The news comes barely a month after online talent firm Fullscreen launched its own subscription video platform.  Previously the firm had published content on free platforms like YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat.  YouTube offers an ad-free subscription service of its own - YouTube Red - which costs $10 per month.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36260942	A history of prime ministers caught on mic	David Cameron has been recorded describing Nigeria and Afghanistan as "fantastically corrupt" in a conversation with the Queen. It is not clear whether or not he knew his words were being recorded - but it would not be the first time his unguarded remarks have been caught on microphone - and he's not the only prime minister to have been caught out in this way...  David Cameron was heard joking that Yorkshire people "hate each other", while rehearsing a speech in Leeds. Wearing a microphone but not on camera, the PM said: "We just thought people in Yorkshire hated everyone else, we didn't realise they hated each other so much." Later, Mr Cameron told the BBC's Test Match Special it was "a total joke".  David Cameron, in conversation with ex-New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, unwittingly revealed that the Queen apparently "purred" when he told her Scotland had rejected independence. Overhead by the waiting camera crews, the PM said he had "never heard someone so happy" at the result, and said she "purred down the line". Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the remarks. Mr Cameron said he was "embarrassed" and "extremely sorry".  With just a few days until the 2010 general election, Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown was out and about on the campaign trail to try to woo voters. But on returning to his car after an encounter with Rochdale resident Gillian Duffy, with whom he had been discussing immigration, he was unaware his microphone was still on - and could be heard calling her a "bigoted women". Mr Brown later said he was "mortified" by the slur and a grovelling phone apology to Mrs Duffy was made, but it wasn't enough, and he had to go back to Rochdale to apologise to her in person. The incident was often cited in Labour's subsequent shift in tone on the issue - as the party said that talking about immigration did not make someone a bigot.  US President George Bush's exchanges with UK Prime Minister Tony Blair were recorded at a G8 summit in Russia. They began with Mr Bush apparently asking: "Yo, Blair. How are you doing?" Critics said this was over-familiar and showed a lack of respect on the part of the leader of the free world for his ally. Mr Blair ended the eavesdropping when he spotted the live microphone and switched it off.  People remember Conservative John Major as one of the milder-mannered prime ministers in British history. But, back in 1993, he was an angry man. Embroiled in battles with the more Eurosceptic of his cabinet ministers, he spoke honestly about his feelings to ITN's Michael Brunson. Unaware that he was still being recorded after an interview, Mr Major described his foes as "bastards" he would like to "crucify".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36256765	Facebook Moments facial-recognition app launches in Europe	Facebook has launched its facial-recognition-powered photo-sharing app in the EU and Canada.  The program - Moments - was released in some countries in 2015, but withheld elsewhere because of local data privacy rules.  The company has created a different version of the software to get around these restrictions.  But it acknowledged the new edition required "a little bit of work" for users to get the most out of it.  Moment's core features are that it automatically groups together photos featuring the same friend or friends, and then makes it easy to share the pictures with them if they have installed the same app.  In the original version, the snaps are automatically tagged with people's names, because Facebook is able to match them to other photos in its wider database.  But data protection watchdogs in the EU and Canada had expressed concern their citizens would have no way to opt out of the process.  To address this, the adapted app now links together photos of similar-looking faces but requires the user to identify who they are.  Moments is not the only app to use facial recognition to sort images.  Google Photos is the most popular alternative to do so.  But the search giant has yet to extend the facility to Europe, to avoid falling foul of the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.  Facebook has not disclosed how many people have signed up to Moments since its release on the US's iOS and Android stores 11 months ago.  However, the company has said more than 600 million pictures have been shared via the app so far.  "Our primary purpose is to solve a problem that we know that people have, where they never get the photos that their friends take of them," the app's product manager Will Ruben told the BBC.  "We view that as a pretty different type of sharing than might happen on Facebook, where people share photos more broadly with a large group of friends or even publicly.  "Moments is closer to the type of sharing that might happen these days on Whatsapp or other [private] messaging apps - but it places the photos together into a collection."  Users decide which photos are shared with the people labelled in them, and can withdraw access at a later point.  They can also use the app to turn selected photos into slideshows that can be shared to their Facebook wall and elsewhere.  The technique - which Facebook refers to as "facial clustering" - still relies on some processing being done beyond the user's handset, but Facebook said it had taken great lengths to comply with the EU and Canada's privacy rules.  "A cropped low-resolution of the photo is uploaded [to the cloud] so that your phone gets a numerical representation of that face," Mr Ruben said.  "But that number is not stored anywhere on our servers, and it is only used to compare against the other photos on your phone.  "No comparison is being done on the server."  Copies of the images are, however, stored at Facebook's data centres as soon as they are shared with someone else.  "Facebook has notified this office of the Moments app and advised us that within the EU version of the Moments app they do not control or initiate the use of any feature recognition technology," said a spokeswoman for the Irish Data Protection Commissioner.  "Consideration of this development is ongoing and we will more closely look at the technical details of the app following its release."  Mr Ruben said Facebook believed the original version of Moments remained the "best version" but the new edition was still "easy to use.  "You don't need to label all the faces on your phone," he said.  "The idea is to share with the people closest to you, so usually it's just the top 10 people or so."  One industry-watcher said the lack of auto-tagging might slow the app's adoption.  "Any additional effort that people have to put into a service creates a barrier," said Ben Wood, from the tech consultancy CCS Insight.  "The seamless experience in other markets is therefore more compelling.  "However, once people invest a little time, they will see the benefits, and it could catch on, on that basis."  Facebook's use of facial recognition has, however, caused controversy in the US.  Last week, a US judge refused to block a class action case in which it is claimed the technology violates Illinois's Biometric Privacy Act.  The law states biology-based identifiers - including facial maps and fingerprints - cannot be collected without their owners' explicit consent.  Google is also being sued over the matter.	tech

Alonzo Knowles, 23, made his plea to a court in New York on Monday.  He faces up to 10 years in prison and six years of supervised release.  Knowles was arrested after trying to sell 15 scripts for $80,000 (£55,400) to undercover agents in New York.  As part of a plea deal, Knowles agreed to give up $1,900 and 25 unpublished scripts and music tracks found in his DropBox account.  One of the scripts he had offered to sell to agents was for All Eyez on Me - the forthcoming biopic about rapper Tupac Shakur, who died in a 1996 shooting.  "Alonzo Knowles targeted and hacked into the private emails of celebrities in entertainment and in professional sports," said Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara.  "His crimes did not end with this frightening invasion of privacy, as Knowles then sought to sell what he stole, including unreleased movie and television scripts, to the highest bidder.  "Thanks to the terrific work of the Homeland Security Investigations agents and prosecutors in my office, this story of cybercrime meets celebrity stalking ends well, with the perpetrator caught and convicted."	tech

Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare departs from the military shooter's roots, taking place in a near-future, sci-fi setting.  Fans have reacted by rating the video negatively, expressing almost 1.5 million dislikes in eight days.  Overall, the trailer has amassed almost 16 million views.  The game's 1.5 million dislikes make it the most disliked trailer or promotional video on the site, and the worst-rated gaming video in the site's history. However, it still trails behind Justin Bieber's music video, Baby, with 6.1 million dislikes, and Rebecca Black's Friday, which has more than two million.  Call of Duty is one of the world's best-selling game franchises, selling millions of copies of each annual instalment.  The game's publisher, Activision, said the reaction was down to the passion of gamers for the franchise - and said the company had seen such a reaction before.  "The fact is, while it's very early, pre-orders are off to a very strong start," CEO Eric Hirshberg said in an earnings call with investors.  "Views of the reveal trailer that you referred to are up and, in fact, the number of likes per view on the Infinite Warfare reveal trailer are also the highest we've ever seen.  "We've seen this in the franchise before. The reveal trailer for Black Ops II, which took the franchise into the future for the first time, had the most dislikes of any reveal trailer we had ever made at that time. And that, of course, went on to become our most successful game ever," he said.  "What we know for sure is that if we always just did what worked in the past and never took any creative risks, we wouldn't have a franchise. The day to worry is the day we stop trying new things."  The company is also facing a backlash from some fans over an updated version of their 2007 classic, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare.  The hugely successful title is being remastered with updated graphics for modern consoles, but will only be available to those who purchase the new Infinite Warfare game.  Call of Duty's sales have been in slow decline in recent years, although the most recent instalment, Black Ops 3, reversed that trend in 2015.  Activision is attempting to keep the franchise "fresh" with a new setting, said Piers Harding-Rolls, Head of Games Research at IHS Technology.  "Many veteran players are mostly interested in the multiplayer aspects of the game and can be considered 'core gamers', but more mainstream console gamers often get access to the latest version of the game as a Christmas gift," he said.  "If anything, the popularity of the respective trailers is a response to what is put in front of them - the trailer, the way it is edited and the music.  "After all, what people are liking/disliking is a short video clip and not the actual gameplay quality, which is central to how a game sells over its lifecycle."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36256087	Sadiq Khan dismisses Donald Trump's Muslim ban 'exception'	Sadiq Khan has rejected US presidential hopeful Donald Trump's offer to make the new London mayor an "exception" to a ban on Muslims travelling to the US.  "This isn't just about me. It's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world," he said.  Mr Khan also warned that Mr Trump's "ignorant" views of Islam "could make both our countries less safe".  Mr Trump said he was "happy" that Mr Khan would be leading London.  "If he does a good job and frankly if he does a great job, that would be a terrific thing," he added.  Mr Khan told the BBC he was supporting Hillary Clinton - who is vying for the Democrat nomination - in her bid for the White House, adding: "I hope she trounces him."  Last year, Mr Trump, the Republican presidential hopeful, called for a temporary halt to all Muslims entering the US in the wake of the deadly terror attack in San Bernardino, California.  He said many Muslims nursed a "hatred" towards America and a ban should be in force "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".  What will Clinton v Trump look like?  Who will be Trump's running mate?  Mr Khan, the son of Pakistani immigrants and now London's first Muslim mayor, expressed concern during his election campaign that he would not be able to visit the US, if Mr Trump were elected, because of his faith.  Asked by the New York Times how the ban would apply to Mr Khan, Mr Trump said: "There will always be exceptions."  But in response, the new London mayor said: "This isn't just about me - it's about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world."  He added: "Donald Trump's ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe - it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays in to the hands of the extremists.  "Donald Trump and those around him think that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam - London has proved him wrong."  Mr Khan officially took office on Saturday following Thursday's election, which saw him defeat his Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith by 1,310,143 votes to 994,614 - giving him a larger personal mandate than either of his predecessors Boris Johnson and Ken Livingstone.  Mr Khan accused the Conservatives of using tactics "straight out of the Donald Trump playbook" in their campaign against him during the mayoral race, saying: "They used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other."  But senior Conservatives including Chancellor George Osborne and Defence Secretary Michael Fallon have defended the tone of the Tory campaign, saying it was part of the "rough and tumble" of an election.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36256581	Uber launches vehicles for wheelchairs in London	Uber has launched a fleet of wheelchair-accessible vehicles that can be requested via the app.  The new option is called UberWav and will be available, the company says, "at the push of a button" at the same cost as cheaper UberX fares.  Recently, Brighton councillors considering whether to grant Uber a licence questioned options for wheelchair users.  Accessibility charities were involved in the new service's development.  Scope, Whizz-Kidz and Transport for All are supporting the launch of UberWav, and Uber says it is investing more than £1m over the first 18 months to establish the product.  The vehicles will be equipped with a rear-entry ramp, winch and restraints, allowing wheelchair users to travel with one additional passenger.  An Uber spokesman said the company was initially providing 55 vehicles in the new fleet but planned to expand this to more than 100 "in the coming months".  He added Uber expected wait times of "around 25 minutes" in Zones 1-2 and "40 minutes" in Zones 3-4 during the first few weeks.  "We're proud to be making one of the biggest ever investments in accessible private hire in London and will be working hard to keep waiting times as low as possible as the service expands," said Tom Elvidge, Uber's general manager in London.  The service is "a step in the right direction" according to Ruth Owen, chief executive of Whizz-Kidz.  "This new initiative will give disabled people in London a much-needed additional option for planning their travel across the capital," she added.  In the past, Uber has faced criticism for not offering wheelchair accessible vehicles in more cities.  Recently, the company settled a court case in California after its drivers were accused of turning away passengers with guide dogs.  London is currently the only location in which UberWav has been made available.  "London [black] cabs have always been easier to access because of their big doors and the space where seats flap up at the back," said Prof Tony Travers, at the London School of Economics.  "I think Uber in London were under more pressure because their main competitors had an advantage," he told the BBC.  But Uber may soon be met with added scrutiny from London's newly elected Mayor.  Sadiq Khan focused on public transport issues during his campaign - and dealt with the issue of Uber during an LBC radio phone-in.  Mr Khan told a black-cab driver he felt it had been a "mistake" that Transport for London (TfL) had allowed Uber taxis "to come on stream".  A rival, Karhoo, also launched in London this week.  The app allows travellers to compare and book licensed taxis and private hire vehicles - from black cabs to executive cars.  Karhoo has said it will give users access to more than 30,000 vehicles in London.  Passengers will be able to make multiple bookings and be given a final price at the time of booking.  Unlike Uber, there will also be no surge pricing during peak periods.  "Karhoo gives passengers more choice and transparency when booking a cab and, with our ever-growing network of local operators, Karhoo will make it easier to book a ride outside central London than ever before," said Karhoo chief executive and founder Daniel Ishag.  "It's evidence, lest we need it, that Uber really was a positive disruptive element in the market," said Prof Travers.  "It shows how successful market innovation can drive further innovation."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36024725	Iraq Inquiry: Why has the report taken so long?	The official report into the UK's involvement in the 2003 Iraq War will be published on 6 July - nearly seven years after the inquiry was first announced.  The report - which is more than two million words long - was completed last month and the document has since been subject to a process of national security checks. It will now be sent to the printers.  It is looking at events between 2001 and 2009, centred on the UK's decision to take part in the 2003 invasion, which led to the overthrow of Saddam Hussein - whether troops were properly prepared, how the conflict was conducted and what planning there was for its aftermath.  A total of 179 British service personnel were killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009. Tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians died over the period, though estimates vary considerably. Inquiry chairman Sir John Chilcot says he will not shirk from apportioning blame where he sees fit.  What is the Chilcot inquiry for?  The inquiry was announced by the former prime minister Gordon Brown in June 2009. The last public hearing took place in February 2011.  Although the inquiry never set a deadline for publication, it was widely assumed it would come out in either 2011 or 2012. The subsequent delays have angered the relatives of those killed as well as politicians on all sides of the debate.  There are a number of reasons why it has dragged out so long. The report is a massive undertaking, almost unprecedented in scope, covering almost a decade of public policy.  The inquiry has conceded that it underestimated the scale of the task and needed more resources to begin with. There have been unavoidable political delays, with hearings suspended in the run-up the 2010 general election. There have also been unforeseen events such as the death of one of the panel members, historian Sir Martin Gilbert.  But the main reason for the delay was the long tussle between the inquiry and the government over which classified material could be published alongside the report, or referred to in it.  An agreement was finally reached in the summer of 2014 over access to material such as minutes of Cabinet meetings and the "gists" of personal notes exchanged between former prime minister Tony Blair and US President George W Bush.  The process of giving witnesses criticised in the report the right to respond - known as Maxwellisation - has also taken longer than expected.  The report was pored over by the security services after its completion.  Although this process was shrouded in secrecy, officials were reportedly looking for information that has been inadvertently included that could damage relations with the UK's allies, breach national security or violate the UK's international obligations in any way.  Sir John has said this is standard and necessary practice in official reports containing a lot of sensitive material.  However, he has now confirmed that no material has either been removed or redacted, which Prime Minister David Cameron has described as "good news".  Sir John is responsible for naming the publication date - although given the political sensitivities involved, it has to be agreed by Downing Street.  It is notable that Sir John waited until after the national and local elections on 5 May before making the announcement.  Logistically it will take several weeks for the report to be proofread, printed and for other arrangements to be made for its publication but the decision to wait until the start of July is significant.  Given the controversy surrounding Iraq more than a decade on from the invasion, it has always seemed unlikely that the report would be released during the final stages of the EU referendum campaign culminating in the 23 June poll.  David Cameron - who backed the war - and Jeremy Corbyn - who opposed it - will have other things on their mind at that point.  But the government would not have wanted to wait until the end of July when Parliament goes into recess and MPs would not have the opportunity to debate the report in full. So a date in early July always seemed most likely.  Most of those involved in the decision to go to war have since left front-line politics, although critics say their reputations are on the line.  Tony Blair, the British politician most closely associated with the war, appeared twice before the inquiry, defending his decisions and insisting he would do the same again. Gordon Brown, who was chancellor in 2003 and succeeded Mr Blair as prime minister, also gave evidence.  Other senior Labour ministers in the run-up to the war, including former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon and International Development Secretary Clare Short also appeared.  The inquiry took evidence from a Foreign Office lawyer who quit in protest at the war and from Lord Goldsmith, the former attorney general who advised ministers that the war was lawful. It has also heard from senior diplomats, civil servants and military commanders involved in the build-up to war and the military campaign.  Areas covered include the development of UK policy towards Iraq between 2001 and 2003 and UK-US relations over the period. There was scrutiny of the intelligence available on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and its influence on decisions taken by ministers, as well as events at the UN in the run-up to war.  There was also significant focus on the legal arguments surrounding the war and whether it was justified without explicit UN authorisation. Although witnesses were not asked to testify on oath, all those appearing were asked to sign a piece of paper saying they gave a "full and truthful" account of events.  No. There have already been four separate inquiries into aspects of the Iraq conflict. In 2003, the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee and the joint Parliamentary Intelligence and Security Committee both looked into the intelligence used to justify the war.  The Hutton inquiry, in January 2004, examined the circumstances surrounding the death of scientist and weapons adviser Dr David Kelly. The Butler inquiry, in July 2004, looked once again at the intelligence which was used to justify the war.	politics

Sir John said national security vetting of the report had been completed and it would be published without any material being redacted.  Relatives of the 179 British service personnel killed in Iraq between 2003 and 2009 would get "early sight" of the report, he added.  Prime Minister David Cameron said the publication date was "good news".  Why has Chilcot taken so long?  A spokesman for Tony Blair, who led the UK into military action and gave evidence twice to the inquiry, said the former PM "welcomed the fact that a date has been set for the publication of the report".  The public inquiry was launched in 2009 into the UK's participation in the US-led invasion of Iraq - which led to the toppling of Saddam Hussein and led to British troops remaining on Iraqi soil for six years.  The last public hearing took place in 2011. The report's publication was delayed initially by protracted negotiations over what previously classified material could be published and referred to, including correspondence between Mr Blair and US President George W Bush.  There was a further hold-up because the process of giving witnesses criticised in the report the right to reply took longer than anticipated.  Sir John said the final report would be more than two and half million words long and a date in early July would allow sufficient time for "final proofreading, formatting, printing and the steps required for electronic publication".  "National security checking of the inquiry's report has now been completed, without the need for any redactions to appear in the text," he said in a letter to Mr Cameron. "I am grateful for the speed with which it was accomplished."  In response, Mr Cameron - who has expressed frustration at the time taken to complete the report - said: "It is indeed good news that the national security checking process has been completed within two weeks and without the need for any redactions."  Jack Straw, who was Tony Blair's foreign secretary in the run-up to the war and gave evidence to the Chilcot inquiry, said he was "very pleased" that a date had been set for publication.  He told the BBC News Channel that the report was a "massive task" and he hoped it would be as "comprehensive" as possible.  "Well I'm glad that the report now is coming out - it's over seven years since it was first established and I look forward to seeing what conclusion Sir John and his colleagues come to," he said.  "It was a very important and controversial decision and it is right that the Inquiry has taken the time they felt they needed."  Former Lib Dem leader Lord Ashdown said it was "about time" the report was made public and while he respected Sir John's independence, he believed future inquiries must be conducted in a more timely way.  "They say justice delayed is justice denied, so any delay is unfortunate," he said. "The question is how do we do these things in future and we have to do them much better than this."  Rose Gentle, whose Royal Highland Fusilier son Gordon was killed in a bomb attack in Basra in 2004, said: "We are glad we have finally got the date. We just hope that everything we want to be in it is actually in it."  Sir John has said he will not shirk from apportioning blame where he feels that it is justified, both in terms of the decision to go to war and the preparations for its aftermath.	politics

The Labour leader is expected to highlight positives from last week's elections but say the results were "mixed" for the party.  He will also criticise MPs for "parading on the media to give a running commentary on our party".  "We need, if not across-the-board unity, then at least respect for each other," he will say.  In Thursday's elections, Labour held onto some key councils in England, remained the largest party in Wales and its candidate Sadiq Khan won the London mayoral election.  But it failed to make significant gains in England and slipped into third place behind the Conservatives in Scotland.  Addressing the Parliamentary Labour Party, Mr Corbyn is expected to point to the party's successes before adding: "But let's be clear. The results were mixed. We are not yet doing enough to win in 2020.  "This is only the first stage in our task of building a winning electoral majority, attracting voters from all the other parties and mobilising those who have been turned off politics altogether - as we did last week in Bristol and London.  "But overall we have moved in the right direction. And now we have to build on these results."  Following his victory, Mr Khan said Labour could only win elections if it reaches beyond its own activists to a "big tent" of people.  Most MPs did not back Mr Corbyn in last year's Labour leadership contest, and some senior figures have expressed concern about the direction of the party and its prospects following the elections.  Mr Corbyn will say: "I don't expect, or even want, blind loyalty, but members and supporters expect us all to focus on taking on the Tories - and for our debates to be focused on policy, not personality."  The leader will also say the party is united in its opposition to the government's "failed economic policies", claiming there is a "broad consensus in support of a different kind of politics".  He will add: "Last week's elections showed Labour's recovery has begun in earnest. We now need to work together to turn that into the kind of sustained revival that will deliver an election victory for the whole country in 2020."	politics

The companies had sought to overturn city council regulations which meant drivers had to pass fingerprint-based background checks before they could operate.  However, when put to a public vote, the regulations, introduced in December 2015, were upheld.  The rules were part of a package of regulations which put Lyft and Uber in line with traditional taxi operators.  According to US broadcaster NPR, Uber spent a reported $8m (£5.5m) on a campaign proposing self-regulation instead - known as Proposal One.  However 55% of the 87,212 votes received were against it.  "Disappointment does not begin to describe how we feel about shutting down operations in Austin," said Chris Nakutis, General Manager of Uber Austin.  "We hope the city council will reconsider their ordinance so we can work together to make the streets of Austin a safer place for everyone."  At the time of writing, Uber is still displaying fare estimates for rides in the city.  Lyft said the rules "don't allow true ride-sharing to operate".  The company added: "Instead, they make it harder for part-time drivers, the heart of Lyft's peer-to-peer model, to get on the road and harder for passengers to get a ride."  "Ultimately our goal is to not keep any particular company here or not here," said Austin Mayor Steve Adler during initial discussions about the new regulations, reported the Texas Tribune.  However, many people took to social media to point out that it was the firms' decision to leave.  "Not happy that Prop 1 in Austin failed, but less happy that Uber & Lyft put so many drivers out of work with less than 48 hours notice," tweeted Burnie Burns, founder of comedy and gaming community Rooster Teeth.  "Prop 1's defeat wouldn't mandate that Uber or Lyft stop operating in Austin. That is entirely up to the companies," he tweeted.	tech

The company said it had emailed 794,000 people who may have been affected by the incident.  It said the data had been taken from a version of its website set up for testing purposes.  Security researchers have warned that the details could be used by criminals to try to scam those affected.  The firm said it had reported itself to the UK's Information Commissioner.  UK-based Kiddicare is a baby and child specialist that trades online and from its flagship store in Peterborough.  The company said it became aware of the data breach after customers reported suspicious text messages that had not been sent by Kiddicare.  It was then contacted by a security company with further information and was able to link the breach to a "test" website it had been using in November 2015.  "Kiddicare used real customer data on its test site," said security researcher Graham Cluley in a blogpost.  "It shouldn't be forgotten that this was a test site and things are expected to go wrong."  The company stressed that payment details such as credit card information, which can easily be changed, had not been stolen.  However, customers' names, postal addresses, email addresses and telephone numbers had been exposed and that information could be used by scammers.  Mr Cluley criticised the company for neglecting to post details of the breach prominently on its website, although they have answered some questions on the subject.  "There is currently no mention of the data breach on the Kiddicare website's homepage or on its Twitter account," he wrote.  "I'm not sure that's offering the best service for customers who, through no fault of their own, might now be at risk.  "One clear risk is that Kiddicare customers might be contacted by fraudsters pretending to be the baby specialist retailer, in an attempt to trick unsuspecting consumers into handing over payment information."  The company apologised to customers in a statement sent to the BBC.  "We are very sorry for the potential stress and anxiety this incident may have caused our customers," it said.  "We want to reassure everyone that the problem has been fixed, increased security measures have been implemented and we have a dedicated team to here to help with any further concerns."	tech

Countries affected include Brazil, the US, Canada and Japan but not the UK.  The firm is amending its Payment Protection policy in line with the investment risks and could not confirm if it would be rolled out further.  It is also withdrawing protection for gambling transactions and payments made to government agencies.  "This is consistent with the risks and uncertainties involved in contributing to crowdfunding campaigns, which do not guarantee a return for the investment made in these types of campaigns," the firm said.  An independent study into the crowdfunding site Kickstarter, carried out by the University of Pennsylvania, found that 9% of projects listed on the site "failed to deliver rewards".  The study also found that smaller projects - those seeking $1000 (£693) or less - were the most likely to fail, but that 73% of the investors who took part said they would not be put off investing in another project if one failed.  "We want everyone to understand exactly how Kickstarter works — that it's not a store," Kickstarter said.  "Amid creativity and innovation there is risk and failure."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36247289	Liberty Reserve digital cash chief jailed for 20 years	The founder of the digital currency service Liberty Reserve has been sentenced to 20 years in prison.  Arthur Budovsky had pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit money laundering.  The online facility, shut down in 2013, had operated out of Costa Rica.  Prosecutors in New York said many of its clients had been cybercriminals who had sought to move funds anonymously.  Two other men involved in the business were sentenced to shorter jail terms.  Two more people will be sentenced on 13 May.  The authorities are still trying to locate a further two suspects.  Liberty Reserve had advertised itself as the internet's "oldest, safest and most popular payment processor... serving millions all around [the] world".  Users had to provide a name, date of birth and an email address - but prosecutors said fake credentials had been accepted.  Account holders "converted" their cash into one of the company's digital currencies, following which an "instantaneous" transfer was made and the sum converted back into real-world cash.  For this, the company charged up to $2.99 (£1.98) per transaction.  The US Justice Department said the scheme had been used to process 78 million transactions with a combined value of $8bn (£5.5bn) - many of which were related to hiding the proceeds of credit card theft, identity fraud, hack attacks and Ponzi scam investment schemes.  "Liberty Reserve founder Arthur Budovsky ran a digital currency empire built expressly to facilitate money laundering on a massive scale for criminals around the globe," said Manhattan US attorney Preet Bharara.  "Despite all his efforts to evade prosecution, including taking his operations offshore and renouncing his citizenship, Budovsky has now been held to account for his brazen violations of US criminal laws."  As part of his plea, Budovsky admitted to laundering between $250m and $550m of criminal proceeds related to US-based Liberty Reserve accounts.  In addition to the jail time, the 42 year old was also ordered to pay a $500,000 fine and forfeit $122m of company funds.	tech

The 56 Dean Street clinic in London sent out a newsletter in 2015 that mistakenly revealed the recipients' email addresses to one another.  Patients were supposed to be blind-copied into the email but instead details were sent as a group email.  The Information Commissioner said it was a "serious breach of the law".  "People's use of a specialist service at a sexual health clinic is clearly sensitive personal data," said Information Commissioner Christopher Graham.  "The law demands this type of information is handled with particular care following clear rules, and put simply, this did not happen.  "It is clear that this breach caused a great deal of upset to the people affected."  The email error, made in September 2015, meant that 781 people who had attended HIV clinics and opted in to an online service could see the names and email addresses of other patients.  At the time, the clinic's consultant Dr Alan McOwan said: "We screwed up on this one".  The clinic stressed that not all the people who received the newsletter were HIV positive, but 730 of the email addresses on the list contained the full names of their owners.  "The clinic served a small area of London, and we know that people recognised other names on the list, and feared their own name would be recognised too," said Mr Graham.  The investigation by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) found that the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, which operates 56 Dean Street, had made a similar error in 2010.  A pharmacy employee had emailed an HIV treatment questionnaire to 17 patients, also entering emails in the "to" field instead of the "bcc" field.  "That our investigation found this wasn't the first mistake of this type by the Trust only adds to what was a serious breach of the law," said Mr Graham.  The Trust's Medical Director Zoe Penn said: "We fully accept the ruling of the ICO for what was a serious breach and we have worked to ensure that it can never happen again.  "I reiterate my apology to all those that were affected by this incident.  "We have kept in touch with affected individuals, with their consent, to update them on the actions we have and will continue to take in order to prevent others from being put in a similar situation in the future."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36241422	Cameron to remain PM until end of decade	David Cameron will continue as PM until the "end of this decade", Chancellor George Osborne has predicted.  Mr Cameron has said that he will not seek a third term but some have suggested he may have to quit sooner, if the UK votes to leave the EU.  While he is campaigning to stay in, many Tories are on the opposite side.  Mr Osborne, a likely future leadership contender, told ITV he did not envisage a contest until close to 2020 "when David Cameron says he wants to go".  Interviewed on ITV's Peston on Sunday, he denied being preoccupied by thoughts of becoming the next Tory leader.  "There will be a leadership election at the end of this decade, we've got a lot of work to do before then," he said.  "I fought very hard to get my friend elected as leader of the Conservative Party, then elected as the prime minister of this country and I'm very happy being part of that team that is bringing about this change to this country."  He added: "It will be the end of this decade in my view, when David Cameron says he wants to go."  Mr Cameron, who became prime minister at the head of a coalition government in 2010, will by then have served nearly two full terms in office.  He ruled out a third term before the 2015 general election, telling the BBC: "I've said I'll stand for a full second term, but I think after that it will be time for new leadership.  "Terms are like Shredded Wheat - two are wonderful but three might just be too many."  He named Mr Osborne, Home Secretary Theresa May and outgoing London mayor Boris Johnson as potential successors at the time.  But his position at the forefront of the campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union has meant some have questioned whether he can remain in the job if the 23 June referendum delivers a "Leave" result. The prime minister has said he will stay on, even if he ends up on the losing side.  But former chancellor Ken Clarke, a veteran pro-European Conservative, has suggested Mr Cameron "wouldn't last 30 seconds if he lost the referendum", predicting the party would be "plunged into a Conservative leadership crisis". And UKIP leader Nigel Farage told the BBC last week he did not think Mr Cameron would remain PM if the UK votes to leave.  Others campaigning for the UK to leave, say Mr Cameron should stay regardless of the result. Commons leader Chris Grayling said in April: "It would be disastrous, in my view, for the Leave cause if we vote to leave and then we get distracted by a Conservative leadership contest. " Former Conservative leadership contender David Davis has said he believes Mr Cameron could stay on, but would not be able to lead exit negotiations.	politics

The news has prompted headlines around the world, and Politicians and city leaders have taken to Twitter to congratulate him, including the left-leaning mayors of New York and Paris.  Congratulations also came from Ahok Basuki Purnama, the governor of Jakarta. He became Jakarta's first Christian governor in 50 years when he was elected in 2014.  Jemima Goldsmith, the sister of Conservative party rival Zac Goldsmith, congratulated Mr Khan on his victory. The ex-wife of Pakistani cricketer and politician Imran Khan also appeared to criticise her brother's campaign.  The New York Times describes Mr Khan's victory as "striking" and leads with the fact that he is London's first Muslim mayor. It described London as a city with an acute shortage of affordable homes and a creaking, overcrowded mass transit network.  A commentary in German news magazine Der Spiegel describes Mr Khan's win as a "victory over Islamophobia", and says London is breaking new ground. "The mayoral election shows that London is more liberal, clever and tolerant than the Conservative mudslingers would like to think," it says.  Qatari daily Al-Sharq says: "Once again, the British capital enters history, this time through the gate of democratic victory by electing a Muslim of immigrant descent as its mayor."  Pakistan's Dawn newspaper says that Khan should see himself as a role model for millions of Muslims living in Europe.  With the rise of increasingly popular right-wing parties across the continent, the paper's Brussels correspondent Shada Islam writes that "Khan's story should help set the record straight on immigration, integration and European Muslims".  History Professor Juan Cole points out that Mr Khan is by no means the first Muslim in charge of a European city. In a popular blog post he traces the history of Muslim rule in Spain, Greece, the Balkans, and Sicily. "Not to mention that Constantinople/Istanbul is one of the larger European cities... the mayor there is a Muslim," he says.  Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, former co-chair of the UK Conservative Party, and Business Secretary Sajid Javid congratulated Mr Khan and pointed out their similar backgrounds.  "Bus drivers are clearly the new Etonians" quipped writer and conservative activist Tim Montgomerie, referring to the elite public school attended by Prime Minister David Cameron and Mr Goldsmith.  In France's Le Figaro, London-based French essayist Laetitia Strauch-Bonnart says "two images of the United Kingdom" faced each other in this election: The "exemplary success story" of Mr Khan's life and "the billionaire's son", Mr Goldsmith.  "In order to appeal nowadays, it is better to have a disadvantaged background, a personal history made of difficulties and social mobility," she told the paper. "It's the spirit of the time, and Goldsmith was not on the right side."  Finally, before the result was in, former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt tweeted a warning about how Mr Khan could possibly be treated if Republican hopeful Donald Trump was to become US President.	politics

After 113 results out of 124 councils, UKIP has 55 seats so far, a gain of 26.  It won six seats on Thurrock Council and just missed out on being the largest party by a single vote.  Ex-Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless were among seven gains on the Welsh Assembly, and UKIP came second in two Westminster by-elections.  It was beaten by Labour in Ogmore, in South Wales, and Sheffield Brightside in South Yorkshire.  But it gained two seats on the London Assembly, for David Kurten and mayoral candidate Peter Whittle, from the London-wide top-up list, where it came fourth with 171,069 votes, its best performance in London for some years.  Mr Farage told Sky his party was "really biting hard" into Labour's vote and was "the third biggest party now in the United Kingdom by a country mile".  He added: "There will be many people who see Jeremy Corbyn's Labour as more extreme than UKIP by a country mile."  Mr Hamilton, who was a Conservative MP for Tatton from 1983 until being voted out in 1997 after becoming embroiled in the cash for questions controversy, admitted Mr Farage had opposed him standing for UKIP.  "Well, there's no secret about that, but Nigel is a democrat and I was selected by the overwhelming vote of the party members in Wales for a winnable place on the Assembly list," he told BBC Radio 4's World At One.  "We will all work together as a team regardless of things that have divided us hitherto."  "I think it has been recognised that UKIP are challenging us," she said. "I think that is a deep worry."  Mr Farage also tweeted that UKIP's progress in Wales justified the amount of money he had spent travelling there to campaign in the Welsh Assembly elections.  Polling expert Professor John Curtice said UKIP's vote in Wales was simply maintaining the level that the party achieved in 2015.  Among its other gains around the country, the Eurosceptic party gained two seats in Bolton, where its total reached five.  In Havant, the party gained seats from Labour in wards that the party has not previously contested at all.	politics

The Labour leader hailed an "excellent" result in Wales and pledged to "walk hand in hand" with Scottish colleagues after they slipped to third behind the Conservatives.  Labour retained control of several key councils in England and remained the largest party in Wales.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told "begrudgers" to "put up or shut up".  Pollsters had predicted losses for Labour in the local elections, with the party defending gains it made in 2012 under Ed Miliband.  Speaking alongside Gill Furniss, who won Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough in one of two Labour Parliamentary by-election holds, Mr Corbyn said: "All across England last night we were getting predictions that we were going to lose councils. We didn't.  "We hung on and we grew support in a lot of places."  He congratulated the "hard work" of campaigners in the Scottish Parliament elections, adding: "There is a lot of building to do in Scotland.  "We are going to be with you. We are going to walk hand in hand with the party in Scotland to build that support up once again so that the Labour tradition in Scotland will be established once again."  They were lining up to denounce him - and some have actually done so. Labour MPs who are convinced that if Jeremy Corbyn remains their party leader, defeat at the next general election will be inevitable. But the results were messier than they predicted.  Labour remained the largest party in Wales, but fell short of a majority, suffering a shock defeat in the Rhondda seat to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood.  In London, Sadiq Khan is set to beat Tory Zac Goldsmith to become London mayor.  In the build-up to the polls there were reports of a possible leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn if results did not go his way.  A senior Labour MP told the BBC Mr Corbyn had a year to improve his performance, warning a "weak leader" was a problem on the doorstep and describing the party's performance as "shocking".  The GMB union called on critics of Mr Corbyn to rally round but said it also expected the Labour leader to raise his game.  "We're at the stage when we should be winning hundreds of seats," Tim Roache, its general secretary said.  "Let's give it a go. Let's give it a go for a year or so. Who knows what might happen? Leicester City won the Premier League only the other day. Who knows."  But Mr McDonnell told critics to "get behind the leader of the Labour Party that was democratically elected".  He added: "I think most Labour Party members are saying 'look, you're damaging our campaign by the continuous carping'.  "I've never been in a situation where, two days before a poll, a group of them are talking to the media about a leadership coup - and yet we still do well."  Former Labour minister Lord Falconer urged the party to focus "outwards" following a row over anti-Semitism involving the suspension of MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone.  "There's real issues that need to be dealt with, but this idea of a divided party makes the Labour party despair and the public despair," he added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36229789	Norman Lamb: Gains signal Lib Dem 'fight back'	Former Liberal Democrat leadership contender Norman Lamb claims the party is "fighting back" following "modest gains" in England's local elections.  The Lib Dems, who were almost wiped out in the 2015 general election, have 289 councillors so far - an increase of 29.  The party has won five seats in the Scottish Parliament election, but just one in the Welsh Assembly.  "It's very many years since I was last able to say 'Lib Dem gains' but that's what we're seeing today," said Mr Lamb.  "It's modest, there's nothing dramatic happening, but we're up four points on last year. We have gained two constituencies from the SNP in Scotland - that would have been hard to imagine a few months ago.  "Kirsty Williams in Wales won a seat that we lost to the Conservatives in the general election last year - and across England, modest gains - so green shoots after a near fatal knock out blow last year and it shows that there's still life there and we're fighting back."  Meanwhile, John Leech, former Lib Dem MP for Manchester Withington, has resumed his seat on Manchester City Council.  The Liberal Democrats, who were in coalition with the Conservatives between 2010 and 2015, were hammered in last year's general election, when their ranks of MPs were reduced from 57 to eight.  Mr Lamb, a former health minister, told the BBC his party now has to be very clear about what it stands for "so people understand the point in voting for the Liberal Democrats", adding there is "a desperate need for a liberal progressive movement" to challenge the Conservatives as Labour has "taken itself off to the left".  "If you just get a sense that the Tories have no challenge, then you get arrogant and complacent government and that's why it's just so important that we rebuild and rebuild as fast as we can," he said.  Fellow Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said while the party is not "cracking open any bottles of bubbly" in the wake of the results, "any gains" are good news, and the task now is to rebuild its identity "which got lost" during its time in the coalition.  "The party as a whole will feel we fought a good battle yesterday and it's paid off. We're positive about our future now," he said.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36225971	Rural broadband only on request, says government	The government will not automatically roll out broadband to those areas of the UK that don't yet have services, it has been confirmed.  Instead, its Universal Service Obligation, announced last year, will require homes and businesses to request providers offer net connections.  Those "broadband have-nots" could face a four-year wait until they are legally entitled to request such a service.  How the process will work and who will pay for it remain unclear.  In a consultation document on the USO, the government said: "Given the high costs of providing broadband access to premises in remote areas it is right that this is done on request, rather than rolling it out and waiting to see if people in those areas want to be connected.  "We know from the various interventions that the government has made to date that it is unlikely that everyone will want to be connected, even if that option is made available to them, and so we do not believe that an additional broadband rollout programme at this time is proportionate or would represent value for money."  But it denied reports that this represents a U-turn, saying it had never claimed there would be further rollouts.  "It's absolute nonsense to suggest we're leaving rural areas behind in our rollout of broadband.  "Our current plans will reach at least 95% of the UK, but we want everyone to have fast broadband so we are introducing a Universal Service Obligation to help make sure no-one is left behind," a spokesman for DCMS told the BBC.  The government has said it hopes to have the USO in place "by the end of this Parliament" in 2020, adding it was working to make it happen "as soon as possible".  How it will be funded remains unclear but it is likely to be along similar lines to the way the legal obligation for telephone services operates - the onus on funding is on BT, up to a threshold of £3,400. If costs go above that, the home owner is asked to contribute.  In November 2015, the prime minister announced the government's intention to implement the new broadband universal service obligation (USO) to provide broadband speeds of at least 10Mbps (megabits per second) to everyone, saying it wanted to put broadband on a more equal footing with essential services such as electricity and water.  Under current plans, the government hopes to deliver broadband to 95% of the UK by December 2017.  The DCMS estimates that up to 1 million UK premises will not be able to access speeds of 10Mbps or higher by that time.  Some agree that the government is right to offer broadband to the final 5% on a demand-only basis.  "If you think back to 2009 when the government floated the idea of imposing a 50p levy on all fixed lines to pay for rural broadband, a number of people in rural areas came out protesting that they wouldn't pay for it, as they didn't want broadband," said Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum.  A study from comparison site uSwitch suggests that even in towns where fast broadband is readily available, take-up is not always as high as might be expected.  BT's own figures also seem to bear this out - its fibre services are now available to 24 million homes but only 22% (5.5 million) have connected to them.  Paul Evans, chief executive of Boosty - a service which boosts fixed broadband speeds with smartphone 3G and 4G - said the fact that there would be no automatic rollout to remote areas "will be met with bitter disappointment".  "Yet again those living in rural areas are deprioritised and denied access to what we now consider to be a commodity service."  Andrew Ferguson, co-founder of broadband news site ThinkBroadband, said universal broadband is already available to most households.  "Satellite connections with speeds well in excess of 10 Mbps are available to all if you can locate a satellite dish with a clear view of the southern sky on your property, but we hope and have urged that the USO only utilise satellite connectivity as a measure of last resort."  Further details of how the broadband USO will work, including how it will be funded, will be laid out in a second consultation, expected this summer.	tech

Following an update the function is now available only on the more expensive Windows 10 Enterprise version, as well as the Education edition.  Many firms try to prevent staff from downloading additional software as it can cause problems with existing programs and affect productivity.  Microsoft said it had made the change "by design".  "Windows 10 Enterprise is our offering that provides IT pros with the most granular control over company devices," the tech giant said in a statement.  "Windows 10 Pro offers a subset of those capabilities and is recommended for small and mid-size businesses looking for some management controls, but not the full suite necessary for IT pros at larger enterprises."  John Harrison, owner of Harrison IT services, said the change could cause problems for small businesses.  "Users like to change settings or try to install software by themselves. If they don't know what they're doing or don't have the appropriate experience, they can cause all kinds of issues," he said.  "You are going to have to educate staff, tell them not to use the Windows Store unless it really is relevant to the business. How do you manage that policy?"  In September 2015 there were 669,000 apps on the Windows Store, according to Microsoft's own figures.  Microsoft says there are 300 million devices using Windows 10 one year after its launch.  On 29 July, a free upgrade offer for Windows users with earlier versions of the operating system will come to an end.	tech

The 1978 space shooter was honoured alongside Sonic the Hedgehog, The Legend of Zelda, The Oregon Trail, Grand Theft Auto III and The Sims.  They join the six inaugural titles from 2015: Doom, Pong, Pac-Man, Super Mario Bros, Tetris and World of Warcraft.  Titles are selected for the US-based museum based on their status among players, longevity and influence.  Hall of fame games become permanent exhibits at The Strong museum of play in Rochester, New York.  The winning games were selected from 15 finalists, which included Final Fantasy, Tomb Raider and the original Pokemon games.  The inductees span genres, decades and platforms but "all have significantly affected the video game industry, popular culture, and society in general," the museum said.  "Although a handful of shooter games preceded Space Invaders, its runaway success, innovative features, compelling graphics, and elemental themes captured the public imagination, spurring many imitators and a craze for arcade games," said Jeremy Saucier, assistant director of The Strong's International Centre for the History of Electronic Games (ICHEG).  Oregon Trail, in which the player controls a wagon of settlers crossing the West in the early days of American settlement, is fondly remembered by many for its fun approach to education as well as its difficulty, which saw players frequently "die" of dysentery.  Grand Theft Auto III, a game with violence and mature themes, made headlines when it was released in 2001. It was a big commercial success, selling 14 million copies.  "Grand Theft Auto III renewed debates about the role of games and violence in society while it signalled video games aren't just for kids," Mr Saucier said.  The Legend of Zelda and Sonic the Hedgehog were the first entries in long-running franchises for Nintendo and Sega respectively, and remain popular today. Both games spawned multiple sequels and spinoffs, including cartoon series.  The Sims, released in 2000, was described by the museum as a "virtual dollhouse game" in which players manipulate digital characters to create their own stories.  "The game has had universal appeal, with female players outnumbering males, and adults as passionate about the game as children," said ICHEG director Jon-Paul Dyson.  "By turning the computer into a toy to explore the complexity of the human experience, The Sims radically expanded the notion of what a game could be."	tech

The shadow home secretary said he had been approached over the role and would "take soundings" in the coming days to make up his mind.  The Leigh MP and former health secretary plans to remain in the shadow cabinet even if he does run.  He has been defeated in two Labour leadership contests.  George Osborne's "Northern Powerhouse" agenda saw the creation of the new post of Greater Manchester mayor as part of the devolution of extra powers to the region.  Former Labour MP Tony Lloyd is serving as the interim mayor of the combined authority, until next year's first election for the role.  "I had not planned for this to come out at this time," Mr Burnham said, saying it was "very early days".  "I have had people approaching me to consider it, so I have decided to consider it."  He said the creation of a regional mayor was an "important change in British politics", saying the North should have a voice alongside Scotland and Wales.  "I still feel we get treated as second class citizens at times, we do not get the investment that London and the South gets," he said.  Whoever does run for the job should be "big enough to get that voice heard", he added.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told Sky News it would be "a real loss to Parliament" if Mr Burnham did run.  Mr McDonnell said he understood why Mr Burnham was approached to run and why he would be tempted, but that he would like him to stay in the shadow cabinet.  "I can see why people in the North are approaching him because he is such a good advocate for the North and he has been a tremendous MP in Parliament," he said.  "If he goes, it would be a real loss to Parliament and a loss to the Labour Party as we go into government in 2020, but I can see why people are approaching him."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36197703	Does Bitcoin still matter?	Craig Wright's assertion that he was the creator of Bitcoin this week occurred at the same time as thousands of members of a growing industry tied to the virtual currency attended the Consensus 2016 conference in New York.  Attendees debated the truth of Wright's claims, but also grappled with the more poignant question of whether Bitcoin still matters?  Bitcoin has come a long way since its start. What was once marketed as a global currency - free from government restrictions - is now seen as a burgeoning technology that can help improve the world's financial system and change how information and assets are stored and shared.  Hundreds of new companies have started that focus on creating blockchains, the underlying ledger system on which Bitcoin is based.  The answer to Bitcoin's relevance depends on whether you are talking about the digital currency or the industry.  Because Bitcoin was the first digital currency, the sector as a whole is often referred to as the Bitcoin industry.  It now prefers to be called blockchain - after the technology which underpins Bitcoin.  The currency is struggling because of strains on its technology and persistent doubts about when and if it can become a mainstream form of money.  The blockchain industry however is thriving as new uses for the technology continue to be dreamed up and investors continue to fund them.  "Digital currency is now a misnomer for Bitcoin," says Erik Voorhees, chief executive officer for Shape Shift, a digital currency exchange. "It can be used as currency, but it can be used for many things."  Blockchains rely on cryptography to allow a set of computers to make changes to a global record without needing a central actor.  Removing the middleman cuts costs in almost every sector.  The blockchain is a ledger that records everything that happens to a collection of data known as a "block" in a chronological order or "chain".  As a currency this is an important feature because it allows users to be sure their digital money is one of a kind, the same way each note in your wallet is unique.  "Blockchain tech will be the way we create assets because it allows you to transfer digital information without copying," says Adam Ludwin, chief executive of Chain.com, which builds blockchain networks.  Blockchain can be used to track the history of all sorts of information and maintain its value, so, for example, doctors could use it to update medical records.  Since each change to a blockchain is made simultaneously across the whole network, no information is lost and because changes cannot be undone the system maintains its transparency. A special key is needed to make changes to each block, so individuals can keep their records safe by protecting that key.  The original code for Bitcoin was designed to produce a fixed amount. Its popularity has meant the digital currency is coming to its limit faster than many expected.  Among Bitcoin's core engineers there is a division about how to fix this problem.  One group advocates doubling the size of the "blocks" in Bitcoin, something that could help, but may be short-term. Another group advocates rewriting its underlying protocols to have far more blocks - a solution that would make old Bitcoins incompatible with the new ones.  For companies that are thinking of using blockchain tech or digital currency, this schism makes it hard to choose Bitcoin.  "This is sending signals that are making engineers worried," says Jeff Garzik, one of Bitcoin's core developers. "People are waiting to see what happens before launching."  Almost since Bitcoin's creation there have been copycats. As more industries warmed to the idea of blockchain these imitators began to look less like virtual currencies and more like digital record keepers.  Some of these are public - allowing anyone to join and grow the chain - while others are private to ensure only trusted parties have access, an approach favoured by banks.  This explosions of new blockchains has created a need for inter-ledger operators. These companies allow people to exchange digital assets from one blockchain to another.  "Blockchain is another database and it's impractical to think of the world working on one database," says Chris Larsen, the chief executive of global financial settlement company Ripple.  For believers in a government-free digital currency, Bitcoin is the still the biggest player.  Virtual currencies could still have a place in finance, particularly in countries with less stable governments and economies. Governments though have been looking for ways to add regulation, in an effort to prevent tax dodging, money laundering and other criminal activities that were associated with the early Bitcoin days.  Eventually blockchains could allow users to exchange the rights to all sorts of assets, like houses or stocks, update records and make payments without relying on a third party to verify the transaction.  But for this to become a reality more users will have to join blockchains.	tech

A technique called binaural recording can be used to create a more realistic, three-dimensional experience, but the effect only works if your head stays still while listening - and in virtual reality you can turn your head in all directions.  But the BBC's Research and Development department may have found the solution with dynamic binaural sound.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36212086	Pilots report more than 1,400 laser incidents in 2015	More than 1,400 incidents of lasers being shone at aircraft were reported to the UK's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) in 2015.  The number was slightly lower than in 2014 - but reports by police helicopter pilots more than doubled.  The British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) said the increasing power of lasers raised the possibility of a serious accident.  One pilot called for the sale of strong lasers to be controlled.  The CAA said 1,439 laser incidents had been reported in 2015, a slight decrease on the previous year's total of 1,447.  But the National Police Air Service told the BBC its helicopter pilots had reported 91 laser incidents in 2015, more than double the previous year's total of 35.  Stephen Landells, flight safety specialist at Balpa, called for lasers to be classed as weapons.  "If you shine even the weakest laser at an aircraft, you can dazzle and distress the pilot at a critical stage of flight," he told BBC Radio 5 live.  "We need to educate people. It's not only illegal, you are actually endangering people's lives when you shine a laser at an aircraft.  "We're looking to try and get the law changed to take into account the fact that these lasers can be used as weapons."  Airline pilot Janet Alexander told the BBC: "A concentrated laser beam into the cockpit is analogous to a lightning strike.  "We're not talking about the things you use in lectures... we're talking about the sort of things you might see at an open air music festival or something like that.  "Even if it doesn't hit your retina, it's very dazzling and you do momentarily lose your vision."  A Home Office spokeswoman said: "The UK has strict laws dealing with people who recklessly use lasers against aircraft and endanger the lives of passengers and crew.  "Anybody who does so faces up to five years in prison."  The UK Civil Aviation Authority told BBC Radio 5 live: "We strongly urge anyone who sees a laser being used in the vicinity of an airport to contact the police immediately".	tech

Nathan Blecharczyk told the BBC the willingness of people to stay in the home of a stranger showed the demand for personal connections while travelling.  He said the company was now looking at pairing hosts and guests for tours, playing sport, and other activities.  Airbnb operates in 34,000 cities in 191 countries and is valued at about $25bn.  The company, which allows anyone to rent out spare space in their home to tourists, advertises its service as "experience a place like you live there".  "What we've demonstrated is there's an immense appetite to travel more authentically and immerse yourself in culture... as opposed to having a commoditised experience," said Mr Blecharczyk, the company's chief technology officer.  He said the company's hosts, of which there are more than a million, wanted to participate more in guests' experiences.  "Maybe that's someone going for a bike ride on their favourite bike route or doing a game of Frisbee, something as simple as that," he said.  "But connecting with real people having a good time, that's something not currently available in the professionalised world of hospitality.  "What are the sort of things people are doing outside their home?  "How can we help them to better connect with the local spots, the local people?"  Mr Blecharczyk was speaking in Delhi, where the company is pushing to attract new business after seeing growth of 115% in the past year.  It now lists 18,000 properties across India.  Any expansion by the company into new territory is likely to be closely observed by opponents.  The city of Berlin began implementing restrictions on private rentals through the service at the start of May, which it called "a necessary and sensible instrument against the housing shortage".  It follows a similar move in the company's home city of San Francisco late last year to limit short-term rentals.  That proposition was defeated at the polls, with 55% of voters rejecting the idea.	tech

Craig Wright had pledged to move some of the virtual currency from one of its early address blocks, an act many believe can only be done by the tech's creator.  This would have addressed complaints that earlier evidence he had published online was misleading.  Dr Wright said that he was "sorry".  "I believed that I could put years of anonymity and hiding behind me," he blogged.  "But, as the events of this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke. I do not have the courage. I cannot.  "When the rumours began, my qualifications and character were attacked. When those allegations were proven false, new allegations have already begun. I know now that I am not strong enough for this."  Dr Wright had earlier indicated that he would transfer some bitcoins from "block 9" by using a private key thought to be known only to Satoshi Nakamoto, a pseudonym used by the person or team that designed the crypto-currency.  Satoshi is known to have used the address in 2009 to send coins to a computer scientist.  Dr Wright had promised the "extraordinary proof" in light of a growing backlash against one of his blogs.  On Monday, the Australian had posted what seemed to be evidence that he had Satoshi's key by describing a process that led to the creation of a "digital signature".  But soon after, this was attacked by security researchers who linked the signature to an earlier Satoshi Bitcoin transaction that could be found via a search engine.  Dr Wright subsequently wrote that he was the victim of "false allegations" and would prove his case by both moving the coins and by sharing "independently verifiable documents".  Dr Wright's claims had initially been bolstered by the fact that two senior members of the Bitcoin Foundation - an organisation set up to protect and promote the virtual currency - had said they were convinced he was indeed behind the technology.  Dr Wright had shown Gavin Andresen and Jon Matonis other evidence in private before the BBC, the Economist and GQ magazine reported his claims at the start of the week.  He apologised to the two men in his latest blog.  "I know that this weakness will cause great damage to those that have supported me, and particularly to Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen," he wrote.  "I can only hope that their honour and credibility is not irreparably tainted by my actions. They were not deceived, but I know that the world will never believe that now. I can only say I'm sorry. And goodbye."  Mr Matonis has tweeted that there "won't be another Satoshi".  The BBC understands that this tweet signifies that Mr Matonis still believes Dr Wright is indeed Satoshi.  Dr Wright's website no longer contains his original blogs, but only his final message.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.  However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.  To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called "mining" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.  For each problem solved, one block of bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new bitcoins.  This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.  To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of several thousand new bitcoins a day. There are about 15 million bitcoins currently in existence.  To receive a bitcoin a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the bitcoins are sent.  Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.  These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the bitcoins owned.	tech

Nellie Kroes spent 11 years with the European Union's executive body as commissioner for competition and also head of its Digital Agenda initiative.  The board will advise the company on its global expansion and held its first meeting earlier this week.  In office, Ms Kroes criticised attempts to ban Uber in some European countries.  In 2014, she said he was "outraged" by a decision in a Brussels court to stop its drivers working in the city.  "This decision is not about protecting or helping passengers - it's about protecting a taxi cartel," she wrote on her official European Commission blog.  Others appointed to the board include Roberto Daniño, the former prime minister of Peru, ex-US secretary of transportation Ray LaHood and Allan Fels. previously chairman of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission,  A spokesman for Uber told the BBC the board members were chosen because of their experience in public policy affecting the company and mix of nationalities.  "As Uber continues to expand globally and introduce innovative products, we're encountering novel policy issues at the intersection of technology, transportation and competition," the spokesman said.  "We know we don't have all the answers and we're excited to get guidance from this group of experienced leaders."  The company's international expansion has been followed by objections from taxi operators and governments.  In London, protests took place in January this year because black cab drivers said the service was "unfair competition", although the city's transport authority, Transport for London, disagreed. In France, the government intervened to close a version of the app following nationwide protests by taxi drivers last summer.  Uber's chief advisor David Plouffe said the company believed car-booking apps would form a part of transport networks worldwide and the new public policy group would offer advice on the challenges the company faces.  "Uber has a reputation for getting straight to the point (sometimes a little too quickly) and we want their feedback to be equally direct," he said.	tech

Elections are taking place for the Scottish Parliament, National Assembly of Wales, the Northern Ireland Assembly and for 124 councils in England.  Mayors will be elected in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford, with UK parliamentary by-elections held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside.  Police and crime commissioners are also being elected in England and Wales.  Problems were reported in Barnet, North London, where the council apologised after some people were unable to vote on Thursday morning.  The Electoral Commission said some polling stations did not have the correct lists of people's names.  Later in the morning, the council said the correct registers had been delivered and those denied a vote should come back.  Polling stations across the length and breadth of the country opened at 07:00 BST, with voting allowed until 22:00 BST.  Thursday's polls are the single largest test of political opinion before the next general election, which is scheduled for 2020.  Elections to the Holyrood Parliament in Edinburgh and the devolved assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast last took place in 2011.  The SNP has been in power in Scotland since 2007, while Labour has run the Welsh government since 1999.  There is a power-sharing arrangement in place in the Northern Ireland Executive. The DUP and Sinn Fein have been the two largest parties at Stormont since 2011.  In total, 2,747 seats in English councils - spanning metropolitan boroughs, unitary authorities and district councils - are up for grabs. The majority of the seats were last contested in 2012.  In London, the Greater London Assembly will be elected, as will a successor to the capital's mayor Boris Johnson, who has run City Hall since 2008. Mayoral contests will also be held in Bristol, Liverpool and Salford.  New MPs for the constituencies of Ogmore, in Bridgend County, and Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough will also be chosen.  The Ogmore by-election was triggered by former Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies's decision to stand for the Welsh Assembly. The Sheffield contest was caused by the death of sitting Labour MP Harry Harpham.  Voters in 40 police force areas in England and Wales, excluding London and Greater Manchester, will also elect a police and crime commissioner. The inaugural elections for the positions were held in 2012.  Counting will take place throughout Friday with the majority of results declared on the day.  However, some English council results will not be announced until Saturday while the final result of the Northern Irish election is not expected until Sunday.

After that, counting begins, with the results coming in at different points over the next 24 hours.  Watch: Which seats are up for grabs?  In London, counting the votes will begin the day after polling day, with the new mayor expected to be announced from mid afternoon. Votes cast for the London Assembly will also be counted on Friday.  Declarations in Scotland and Wales are expected overnight on Thursday, and during Friday in Northern Ireland.  Where to watch the results on the BBC  An election special, presented by Huw Edwards, starts at 23:45 on BBC One, after Question Time, with coverage throughout the night as results come in. On BBC Radio 5 Live, Jim Naughtie and Anna Foster present an election special from 00:30.  All the latest developments are on the BBC politics website, with rolling updates on the Election Live page.  Until polls close, we are limited in what we report.  There are also dedicated programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Anyone 18 or over on 5 May who is a British citizen living in the UK, a qualifying Commonwealth citizen living in the UK, or an EU citizen living in the UK, can vote in the English, Welsh, London or Northern Irish contests. In Scotland, 16 and 17-year-olds are also eligible to vote.  If you have received a polling card through the post then you are registered to vote. If not, you may need to check with your local authority that you are still on the electoral register, particularly if you have moved house recently. The deadline to register was Monday, 18 April.  Most people vote in person at a polling station on the day. It is normally a local school or community centre - the location will be on your polling card. You do not need to take the polling card with you in order to vote. A member of staff will give you a ballot paper with a list of candidates and parties on it. Put a cross in the box next to the ones you want to vote for.  The deadline to apply to vote by post has now passed. If you have already applied, ballot papers should be completed and returned, ensuring you leave enough time for them to arrive by 10:00 on 5 May.  If you have a specific, long-term reason that you can't vote in person, such as a disability or being overseas, you can apply to allow someone to vote for you. Full details about proxy votes, as they are known, are on the Electoral Commission website.  If you are suddenly incapacitated or taken ill, you can apply to vote by proxy for medical reasons up until 17:00 on polling day. Polling stations are open between 07:00 and 22:00.  What happened last time: The SNP formed a majority government for the first time after the 2011 Holyrood elections. The elections use a mixture of first-past-the-post constituency seats, like at a general election, and proportional representation to select regional seats that act as a top up.  What to watch for: The SNP will be disappointed with anything less than another overall majority and will be expecting to amass an even larger one. Labour will be hoping to show some signs of recovery and prevent the Conservatives from overtaking them. The Lib Dems are competing to remain a viable force in Scotland.  What happened last time: Labour gained ground in the 2011 elections and chose to govern alone rather than in coalition with another party. Plaid Cymru's seats and vote share both dropped, as did those of the Lib Dems.  What to watch for: Labour will do well to maintain their current level of seats. The Conservatives have performed strongly in recent elections in Wales and will be hoping to make further progress. UKIP have strong hopes of gaining their first Assembly seats. Plaid Cymru will be hoping to make gains, while the Lib Dems are, as elsewhere, scrapping to stay in the game.  What happened last time: The last assembly election was held in 2011, with the DUP and Sinn Fein remaining the two largest parties. These elections use a system of proportional representation, known as the Single Transferable Vote, with voters ranking candidates in order of preference.  What to watch for: Each of the 18 Northern Ireland constituencies elects six members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) so there are a total of 108 MLAs. Few are expecting big changes, but there has been little polling on which to base a prediction.  What happened last time: Conservative Boris Johnson hung on as mayor by a tighter margin than expected in 2012, with a strong swing to Labour in the Assembly elections, which take place on the same day.  What to watch for: Every election so far for the London mayor has basically been a Conservative v Labour battle. This time Sadiq Khan is Labour's candidate, with Zac Goldsmith standing for the Conservatives. The Greens' Sian Berry will hope her party again finishes above the Lib Dems, represented by Caroline Pidgeon. UKIP are snapping at their heals in the polls so Peter Whittle will look to improve on the party's past performance.  The other candidates look set to be: Former Respect MP George Galloway, Winston McKenzie, English Democrats; David Furness, BNP; Jonathan Silbermann, Communist League; Paul Golding, Britain First; Sophie Walker, Women's Equality Party; Lee Harris, Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol; Paul Tavares, Independent; John (Janek) Zylinski, Independent; Upkar Singh Raj, National Liberal Party.  State of play: Councils hold elections at different times. The last time these seats were up for grabs, in the immediate aftermath of George Osborne's 2012 "omnishambles" budget, Ed Miliband's Labour Party made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems, adding 800 councillors.  Where elections are being held: 124 councils in England.  All seats are up for grabs in three councils: Sheffield, Knowsley and Rotherham  Metropolitan boroughs: A third of council seats are up for election in 32 of 36 Metropolitan boroughs including Birmingham, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle and Sunderland. All but five are Labour held.  Unitary authorities: In three councils - Bristol, Peterborough, Warrington - all seats are up for election while 16 others have a third of seats up, including Derby, Hull, Milton Keynes, Portsmouth, Reading, Southampton and Swindon.  District councils: 12 district councils have all their seats up for election (mostly Conservative controlled towns like Colchester, Gloucester and Woking) while seven have half of their seats up for grabs. In a further 51 councils a third of their seats being contested (a mix of mostly Labour and Tory controlled towns scattered across England).  Mayors are all elected in the same way, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.  The by-election was triggered by the decision of Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davies to stand for election to the Welsh Assembly. Mr Irranca Davies had a 35,250 majority in the South Wales seat.  The contenders hoping to replace him on 5 May are Glenda Davies (UKIP), Janet Ellard (Lib Dem), Chris Elmore (Labour), Abi Thomas (Plaid Cymru) and Alex Williams (Conservative).  The by-election was caused by the death of Labour MP Harry Harpham in February. Mr Harpham had a majority of 13,807.  The contenders are Gill Furniss (Labour), Christine Gilligan Kubo (Green), Stevie Manion (Yorkshire First), Shaffaq Mohammed (Lib Dem), Spencer Pitfield (Conservative), Bobby Smith (Give Me Back Elmo) and Steven Winstone (UKIP).  State of play: Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) were invented by the Conservatives to increase local accountability. They replaced the previous model of police authorities in England and Wales and have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.  The first police and crime commissioner elections in 2012 were mainly notable for very low turnouts of between 10% and 20%. The system has been on probation ever since, amid calls for it to be scrapped, but the Home Office is to grant PCCs greater powers after May.  What to watch for: Voting will take place in 40 police areas in England and Wales, excluding London, where the Mayor is classed as the PCC for the Metropolitan Police and there are separate governance arrangements for the City of London police, and Manchester, where the role of PCC is set to be abolished in 2017, and replaced by a directly elected mayor.  The voting system is the same as the one used to elect mayors, with voters marking their first and second choice of candidate. If no candidate gets a clear majority the top two go through to a second round with second preferences of eliminated candidates allocated to them to produce a winner.  The Conservatives gained the most PCCs in 2012, with 16, followed by Labour on 13. The remaining 12 were independents. As many as half of the PCCs elected in 2012 will not be seeking re-election, making predictions difficult.

Prof Hugh Montgomery from University College London told BBC Radio 4's Eddie Mair that people should not be worried about Google having access to patient information.  It comes after New Scientist revealed that Google had been given access to an estimated 1.6 million NHS patient records.  Google said it had been approached by the NHS and was using the data to develop an early warning system for patients at risk of developing acute kidney injuries.  But critics have questioned why it needs the data of all patients to create such a specific app.	tech

A professional cinema camera which allows the focus, aperture and perspective to be changed after it has been filmed has been developed by technology company Lytro.  The 755 RAW megapixel camera uses "light-field" technology to record the direction and intensity of light, capturing footage in 3D.  The distance of objects or people in front of the lens is also recorded allowing them to be isolated and replaced more easily in post-production than using blue or green screen technology.  The company released its first consumer stills camera which used "light field" technology in 2012.  More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36197153	How the BBC reports polling day 2016	Strict rules mean the BBC, like other broadcasters, isn't allowed to report details of campaigning while the polls are open.  In all national elections, the BBC is required by electoral law to adopt a code of practice, ensuring fairness between candidates.  The basic principle behind due impartiality in political coverage is set out in the agreement accompanying the BBC Charter.  This requires the BBC over time to "give due weight and prominence to all the main strands of argument and to all the main parties".  So, on polling day specifically, the BBC (like other broadcasters, though they are covered by the Ofcom Code rather than a charter) doesn't report on any of the election campaigns from 00:30 BST until polls close at 22:00 BST on TV, radio or bbc.co.uk.  However, online sites do not have to remove archived reports, including, for instance, programmes on iPlayer.  Coverage on the day is restricted to uncontroversial factual accounts, such as the appearance of politicians at polling stations or the weather.  Subjects which have been at issue or part of the campaign - or other controversial matters relating to the election - must not be covered on polling day itself, so the BBC's output cannot be seen to be influencing the ballot while the polls are open.  No opinion poll on any issue relating to politics or the election can be published until after the polls have closed.  Whilst the polls are open, it is a criminal offence to publish anything about the way in which people have voted in that election.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36195498	Last day of campaigning ahead of elections across UK	Party leaders have made a final appeal for votes before Thursday's devolved elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and local polls across England.  Jeremy Corbyn urged voters to "send a message" to David Cameron but appeared to back away from earlier claims that Labour would not lose seats in England, saying predictions "are not that important".  The PM said a vote for his party would secure services and keep bills down.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said she was taking nothing for granted in Scotland.  Guide to May 2016 elections in UK  The Scottish First Minister made her party's case for another five years in power at a final election rally in Glasgow. Northern Ireland's five main party leaders have debated for the last time on the BBC.  The polls will be the largest, in terms of the number of votes expected to be cast, before the next general election. All nations and regions of the UK are going to the polls on what has been dubbed "Super Thursday".  As well as elections to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly of Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly, there will be votes for new mayors for London, Liverpool, Salford and Bristol, as well as for members of the Greater London Assembly.  More than 2,700 seats will also be up for grabs in 124 English council elections, while parliamentary by-elections will be held in Ogmore and Sheffield Brightside, both won by Labour at the last general election.  All police and crime commissioners in England will be up for re-election.  Ahead of his first UK-wide electoral test and amid renewed speculation about his leadership, Mr Corbyn is under pressure to demonstrate his party is making progress after last year's calamitous election defeat.  Mr Corbyn insisted on Tuesday that his party would not lose seats in England and would improve on its performance in 2012 - when the majority of the seats were last fought - when Labour gained almost 800 seats under Ed Miliband.  The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Corbyn's aides were now suggesting his comments had been "misinterpreted" amid the very real prospect of Labour ending the night between 100 and 300 seats worse off.  Speaking during a visit to Wales, Mr Corbyn said: "What I said was, I was not predicting any losses". With the polls now less than 24 hours away, he said "predictions are not that important".  Mr Corbyn campaigned alongside Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones, who is seeking to hold off a resurgent Conservative Party and win enough seats to enable Labour to maintain its 17-year grip on power there.  "The Tories' failed economic policies mean there is now a multi-billion black hole to fill in this Parliament," Mr Corbyn said. "The Tories can no longer be trusted with our communities so send them a message on 5 May."  As the Welsh campaign enters its final stages, Plaid Cymru said it could call a referendum on further assembly powers if it wins power. UKIP has said it expects to win at least five seats in Wales in what it says will be a major breakthrough.  In England, the Lib Dems and the Greens are hoping to make gains while in London, all eyes are on the contest to succeed Boris Johnson as mayor, with the Conservative Zac Goldsmith trying to extend his party's eight-year rule at City Hall.  On Tuesday evening, David Cameron joined Mr Goldsmith at his final rally of the campaign, saying he was the "right man" for the capital as a whole and Londoners should not be "lab rats" for Labour's experimental economic policies.  Labour candidate Sadiq Khan urged Londoners to choose "hope over fear" and played down suggestions he would be affected by the party's recent troubles, saying: "You won't see Jeremy Corbyn's name or Ken Livingstone's name" on the ballot paper."  BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt says Mr Khan plans to keep Mr Corbyn away from his victory celebrations should he prevail, and the two men would not be seen together for several days.  But Mr Khan's team said Mr Corbyn had been invited to his post-election gathering.  Find out more about who is standing in the London elections.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36204531	Webmail firms probe login 'leak'	Several popular webmail providers are investigating a report that millions of their users' login details are being shared online by a hacker.  Google Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Microsoft Hotmail and Mail.ru are among the services said to have been affected.  The security firm that flagged the issue said that it believed many of the usernames and passwords involved had not been leaked before.  However, it is not clear whether users' accounts have actually been breached.  Hold Security said it had obtained a total of 272 million unique pairs of email addresses and unencrypted passwords from the hacker, 42.5 million of which the company had not seen in earlier leaks.  It said the cybercriminal had initially asked for 50 roubles (75 cents; 52 pence) in exchange for the list, but eventually gave a copy away without charge after Hold's staff posted favourable comments about him in a forum.  Even if many of the credentials are out of date or inaccurate they could still be abused, the company warned.  "There are hacker sites that advertise 'brute forcing' popular services and store fronts by taking a large amount of credentials and running them one-by-one against the site," Alex Holden, the firm's chief information security officer, told the BBC.  "What makes this discovery more significant is the hacker's willingness to share these credentials virtually for free, increasing the number of... malicious people who might have this information."  However, Mail.ru - Russia's most used webmail service - said its initial investigation suggested the problem might not be as bad as the figures indicated.  "A large number of usernames are repeated with different passwords," a spokeswoman said.  "We are now checking whether any combinations of username/password match [active accounts] - and as soon as we have enough information we will warn the users who might have been affected.  "The first check of a sample of data showed that it does not consist of any real live combinations of usernames and passwords."  Microsoft said it had measures in place to identify compromised accounts.  "[We would require] additional information to verify the account owner and help them regain sole access," said a spokesman.  Google said: "We are still investigating, so we don't have a comment at this time."  And Yahoo added: "We've seen the reports and our team is reaching out to Hold Security to obtain the list of accounts now. We'll update going forward."  Hold Security has a track record for bringing significant cyber-breaches to light, including past hacks of Adobe and the US retailer Target.  Independent security consultant Alan Woodward said people should remain alert to the dangers of phishing emails.  Even if the vast majority of the passwords did not work, he explained, cybercriminals could still use the list of email addresses to bulk-send scams.  "Assuming the email addresses are valid, they still give criminals the ability to mount certain types of attack," he said.  However he added there was "no need to panic" or for people to change their passwords at this point.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36203093	Elections watchdog seeks more time for Tory probe	The Electoral Commission has met with police and prosecutors to ask for more time to decide on any criminal investigations into the Conservatives' 2015 election campaign spending.  The party has admitted failing to declare £38,000 of general election expenses for accommodation costs, blaming an "administrative error".  The deadline for any prosecutions is 12 months from the date of any offence.  The Electoral Commission is hoping for an extension of at least a month.  The Conservatives said they failed to register what was paid to put up Tory activists involved in the party's Battlebus operation - following a Channel 4 investigation.  David Cameron said the tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  Bob Posner, director of party and election finance and legal counsel at the Electoral Commission, said: "The police and the CPS both have the power to apply to the courts to extend the time limit on bringing criminal prosecutions for electoral offences to allow for full investigations to take place.  "We have requested that they consider doing this."  The commission says it does not take any view on whether charges should be brought.  But if no extension is sought, the ability to do so will expire a year after the submission of returns - which had to be with the Electoral Commission within 35 days of the election on 7 May 2015.  An extension can be sought by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown Prosecution Service said afterwards that the meeting was constructive, and individual police forces will now consider what action to take in response.  Making a false declaration in relation to candidate spending carries a punishment of up to a year in jail and/or an unlimited fine - and anyone found guilty is barred from standing for election as an MP or holding elected office for three years.  No police investigation has yet been launched, but the commission says it seems "sensible for the criminal justice agencies to retain the ability to take action should appropriate evidence come to light as part of the commission's own investigation".	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36203674	Mobile game Sea Hero Quest 'helps dementia research'	Dementia researchers have developed a video game that could lead to the development of early diagnostic tests for the disease.  The way players navigate the 3D levels in Sea Hero Quest will be anonymously tracked and sent to the researchers.  Understanding how people navigate 3D environments is important because the skill is often one of the first lost by people who have dementia.  Researchers say the game could generate an unprecedented amount of data.  "We have never seen anything undertaken in dementia research at this scale before," said Hilary Evans, chief executive at Alzheimer's Research UK, one of the organisations involved.  "The largest spatial navigation study to date comprised fewer than 600 volunteers.  "Providing the research community with access to an open-source data set of this nature, at this scale, in such a short period of time is exactly the kind of innovation required to unlock the next breakthrough in dementia research."  The free game was developed by the charity, researchers from University College London and the University of East Anglia, with the backing of communications giant Deutsche Telekom.  Players follow a sailor's quest to revisit some of his father's memories, and battle fantastical sea creatures.  The routes they take will generate global "heat maps" that will show researchers how people generally explore 3D environments.  The ultimate goal is to develop new diagnostic tests that can detect when somebody's spatial navigation skills are failing.  Researchers from UCL said the game generated useful data about 150 times faster than lab-based experiments.  "In my research team, I could only test about 200 people a year, and that's working hard," Dr Hugo Spiers, from UCL, told the BBC.  "But last night I tested 200 people in one minute with this game."  Players can opt to reveal their gender, age and location to the researchers, although they can choose to take part completely anonymously.  "This project provides an unprecedented chance to study how many thousands of people from different countries and cultures navigate space," said Dr Spiers.  "It's a massive online citizen science experiment that will give us an idea of what is 'normal' through this game.  "If we tile that information together, we can get a sense of how dementia changes over a lifetime, and other demographic factors."  Dr Spiers stressed the game was not itself a test for dementia.  "If you're worried about your memory or any changes to your health, speak to your GP," he said.  The researchers plan to share the first results of their data collection in November.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36202904	Bitcoin expert: It was a mistake to blog about 'creator'	A leading figure in the Bitcoin community has expressed regret about a blog backing an Australian's claim to have invented the crypto-currency.  Craig Wright announced on Monday that he was behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by Bitcoin's creator.  The same day, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, wrote he was "convinced beyond a reasonable doubt" of Dr Wright's case.  But Mr Andresen said he now thinks it was a "mistake" to have posted.  The expert had written that he had privately witnessed Dr Wright using cryptographic keys that "only Satoshi should possess".  But critics called Dr Wright's claim into doubt when it emerged that part of the evidence the entrepreneur presented in public could have been generated using a string of digits linked to a seven-year-old transaction made by Satoshi, accessible via a search engine.  "It was a mistake to agree to publish my post before I saw his - I assumed his post would simply be a signed message anybody could easily verify," Mr Andresen told security researcher Dan Kaminsky when he challenged the scientist over the matter.  "Of course he should just publish a signed message or (equivalently) move some bitcoins through the key associated with an early block."  Mr Andresen has yet to update his blog to reflect this change of view.  Dr Wright has promised to present further "extraordinary proof" including "independently-verifiable documents" and the transfer of a bitcoin from one of the virtual currency's early blocks, which Satoshi would have access to.  At this point, he still has the backing of Jon Matonis - the Bitcoin Foundation's founding director - who has said he has "no doubt" that Dr Wright is responsible for the Bitcoin technology.  But Mr Kaminsky said he now disbelieved Dr Wright's claims bearing in mind Mr Andresen's own doubts.  "Gavin is making no excuses for Wright," Mr Kaminsky told the BBC,  "I don't expect Wright to deliver on his lofty promises, but I also don't expect him to go away.  "Some people just like negotiating with reality."  Dr Wright has said he does not plan to give any further interviews.  But in his most recent blog he noted: "For some there is no burden of proof high enough, no evidence that cannot be dismissed as fabrication or manipulation. This is the nature of belief and swimming against this current would be futile."  Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned.  Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin.  In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin "mining".  Users have a "bitcoin address", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used.  Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts.  Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead.	tech

ASA research suggests many people find it difficult to make sense of current adverts.  More than 80% were unable to calculate the total cost of a broadband contract when asked to do so, the ASA found.  TalkTalk has said it will scrap separate line rental charges.  In a study of how people reacted to current adverts, conducted with regulator Ofcom, only 23% of participants could correctly identify the total cost per month after their first viewing. Twenty-two per cent were still not able to identify this figure after a second viewing, said the ASA.  To make sure broadband providers ensure they stay within the new rules, the ASA recommends that future ads should:  Commenting on the changes, ASA chief executive Guy Parker said: "We recognise the importance of broadband services to people's lives at work and at home. The findings of our research, and other factors we took into account, showed the way prices have been presented in broadband ads is likely to confuse and mislead customers.  "This new tougher approach has been developed to make sure consumers are not misled and get the information they need to make well-informed choices."  "This kind of pricing would tax a maths professor, let alone a consumer who just wants to find the right broadband deal for their household," said telecoms expert Dan Howdle, from comparison website Cable.  "The practice - known as compound pricing - was outlawed in the air industry in 2015. It is recognised as a misleading and disingenuous way to sell a product - luring customers in with cheap headline prices they simply won't be paying at the till."  TalkTalk said it would "lead the way" and called on other providers to make sure that people were not lulled into "seemingly good deals that all too often mask extra charges".  Tristia Harrison, TalkTalk's consumer managing director, said: "As long as line rental and broadband are priced separately, the temptation to advertise deals in this way will always be there. But it's time for providers to be honest about this - it's a bad habit we have all been guilty of, it doesn't serve customers well and it's time it stopped."  Mr Howdle said: "Now TalkTalk has opened fire, the rest of the industry will have to follow."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36160798	App to store old family photos launched	A smartphone app that allows people to upload, store and share their old photographs has been launched by two British entrepreneurs.  The founders hope that the Clixta app can act both as a place where families or other groups can share old photos privately and as a public archive for British social history.  They are working with foundation the Copyright Hub to ensure that each photograph has a digital identifier.  The app will be free initially.  The idea was formed when Dean Newsome and Shaun Cutler - who describe themselves as middle-aged dads rather than typical entrepreneurs - started talking by the side of a football pitch in Morpeth, Northumberland.  "I was in the process of digitising old photos for my in-laws and we realised that there was no place to share these on a large scale," said Mr Cutler.  "We treasure our old photographs and the memories that go with them but we are in real danger of the photos that are gathering dust in the attic or under the bed getting lost forever," he added.  Users can upload photos either by scanning them or by taking a photo with their smartphone. They can choose whether to share them publicly or limit the images to a specified group.  The duo behind the app hope that people will share at least some of their photos publicly.  "I envisage a day when historians and educational institutions can use it, for example, to chart a high street going back over decades," said Mr Newsome.  Andrew Mitchell, a social media officer at Northumberland National Park, is using the app to chart changes in the history of the park  "We are celebrating our 60th anniversary and I read about the app and thought it would be a good fit. We had lots of people telling us that they had pictures but had no way of getting them to us. For us it is a way to see how the park has changed."  "We can do this on Instagram or other social media but there is a lot of digital detritus on there and this allows people to focus on something specific."  A trial version of the Clixta app has been used by around 300 users and is now available to the wider public via Android's Google Play store and Apple's iTunes.  Once it has established its user base, the founders said they may introduce subscriptions.	tech

Instead of men in high-visibility jackets and hard hats, there are going to be drones buzzing overhead, robotic bulldozers and 3D printers churning out new structures.  That at least is the hope of those making technological solutions.  But first they have to convince the traditionally risk-averse construction industry that such change is necessary.  US start-up Skycatch is using drones on some high-profile building projects - although it cannot name them because of commercial sensitivity.  The drones give a bird's-eye view of a site and provide progress reports, speed up the logistics of construction by monitoring deliveries and offer real-time updates on any changes that may need to be made to the plans.  Japanese construction machinery giant Komatsu has gone one step further - using the Skycatch drones to provide the eyes for automated bulldozers. The drones send 3D models of a building site to a computer which then feeds the information to unmanned machinery to plot their course.  Skycatch's chief executive Christian Sanz thinks such combinations of technology could kickstart a robotic building site.  "The more visible data that you have on a site, the more you'll see machines and robots moving things around rather than humans."  One of the potential solutions to the housing crisis could be 3D printing, which is already making an impact on the construction industry - cutting both the time and cost of building houses.  The UN estimates that by 2030 approximately three billion people will require housing and has mooted 3D printing as one possible solution.  A team in the School of Civil and Building Engineering at Loughborough University has been working on the technology since 2007, first developing a 3D concrete printer within a frame and more recently adapting it to work with a robotic arm.  Using a robotic arm means that the team can print up to 10 times faster and create a huge variety of forms, including curved, hollow and geometrically complex shapes.  The group's YouTube video of the system in action has garnered over half a million views, something lead researcher Prof Simon Austin finds astonishing.  "I am still trying to get my head around the fact that a video about concrete - a material normally seen as boring - has had so many views," he said.  It indicates, he hopes, a shift in thinking - not only from the public but also from the construction industry, which is traditionally "risk-averse".  "I think that companies who become early adopters of 3D printing will learn a huge amount about automation and robotics and how they can be exploited on a site," he said.  The team decided to work with concrete as their main material because as Prof Austin says: "There are very good reasons why the built world is made mainly out of steel and concrete - including durability, mechanical performance and aesthetic properties."  Two years ago the research moved into a new phase and the team is now building an industry prototype, working with partners - construction firm Skanska, architects Foster and Partners, materials supplier Tarmac and Scandinavian robotics firm ABB.  The prototype is being tested at the Manufacturing Technology Centre in Coventry, which to date has only worked with hi-tech industries - this represents its first collaboration with the construction industry.  Skanska's director of innovation Rob Francis has high hopes for the technology.  He said: "3D concrete printing, when combined with a type of mobile prefabrication centre, has the potential to reduce the time needed to create complex elements of buildings from weeks to hours. We expect to achieve a level of quality and efficiency which has never been seen before in construction."  Prof Austin sees the future of 3D printing in construction as a way of printing key components of buildings rather than whole structures created in China.  "I'm not convinced 3D-printed concrete would appeal to the high-end of the housing market and in the developing world labour is cheap and they have developed ways of building homes with local materials that have worked for hundreds of years.  "So the idea of bringing a gantry and printing machine to a site to print whole houses is a bit far-fetched," he said. "On the other hand, printing building components where a variety of geometry is sought is an attractive approach that will soon be realised."  It isn't just concrete that is getting a hi-tech makeover.  Design studio Emerging Objects has come up with 3D-printed porous bricks called Cool Bricks that can be filled with water to bring down temperatures.  Each 3D-printed cool brick, has a three-dimensional ceramic lattice-like structure that can hold water in its pores, like a sponge. When air flows through the porous brick it absorbs evaporated water vapour, becoming cooler in the process.  According to the designers, if all the walls of a home were built with porous, water-logged cool bricks, the air flow through them could bring down the home's internal temperature.  Increasingly designers and architects are looking to nature for inspiration and at the Institute for Computational Design, David Correa is convinced that buildings will only be truly smart when they are built with smart materials - many of which can be found in the natural world.  "Things that have lots of mechanics, or software that gets outdated or sensors that go wrong mean that maintenance of smart buildings is an ongoing battle," he told the BBC.  "Pine cones on the other hand have been working for millions of years so imagine a roof surface that can open when it is sunny and close when it rains."  The team designed just such a structure and is now working on creating new materials that can respond to a variety of environmental conditions.  For Allison Dring, head of start-up Elegant Embellishments, it is important that the materials we build with give something back to the environment.  She has designed a smog-eating facade that is coated with a special paint made from titanium dioxide, a pollution-fighting technology that is activated by daylight. It absorbs the fumes generated from traffic and converts them first into nitric acid and then into calcium nitrate, which is harmless.  One of its facades has been put on the side of a hospital in Mexico City.  "It has reduced pollution of about 1,000 cars per day," said Ms Dring.  The firm is in talks with other building owners but, said Ms Dring, it can often be a hard sell to persuade them of the need for such a facade.  "Building owners have to think about investing beyond their building to the wider urban context," she said.  Elegant Embellishments is now working on a new material, made from agricultural bio-waste, that it claims will be carbon negative.  "If you burn the material without oxygen it becomes a pure form of carbon. You are building from air and just by building you can reduce CO2," she added.	tech

The MP was suspended by Labour last week and apologised to the Commons for endorsing calls in 2014 for Israel to be moved to the United States.  The comments triggered a wider row over alleged anti-Semitism within the party, with an inquiry now under way.  Keith Vaz, the chair of the committee, said Ms Shah would not take part in its meetings for the time being.  The committee is beginning an inquiry into the extent of anti-Semitism in the UK and will call Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Ken Livingstone, the former mayor of London who was suspended from Labour for suggesting Adolf Hitler was a Zionist, among its witnesses.  Mr Vaz said Ms Shah - the MP for Bradford West who was elected to Parliament in May 2015 - had requested not to be involved in this inquiry or the committee's other activities for the time being.  "Naz Shah has informed me and the committee that she wishes to stand aside from all her duties until current matters are resolved," he said.  "We have accepted her decision. She will not take part in any future matters concerning the Home Affairs Select Committee with immediate effect."  Mr Corbyn has asked the former head of Liberty, Shami Chakrabarti, to lead an inquiry into the extent of anti-Semitism and "other forms of racism" in the party. No timeframe has been given for when its findings will be published.  Ms Shah told MPs last week that she regretted a series of Facebook posts in April 2014, including one endorsing a suggestion that Israel should be relocated to the United States as a "solution" to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.	politics

He said his party was on course to win its first ever seats in Cardiff - where it is campaigning heavily - and in the Northern Ireland and London Assemblies.  It was "50-50" whether the party would gain representation in the Scottish Parliament for the first time, he said.  He declined to put a target on UKIP gains in English council elections.  UKIP is campaigning on multiple fronts as it seeks to become the only UK party to get people elected to the National Assembly of Wales, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly as well as the Greater London Assembly.  The party has focused much of its time and resources in Wales, where it won 13% of the vote in last year's general election.  Opinion polls suggest UKIP is set to win seats for the first time despite a row over its candidate selection process.  Mr Farage told the BBC's Daily Politics: "There will be a breakthrough in Wales. I think we are going to win five seats - we may do slightly better than that. Let's see."  As for England, Mr Farage would not be drawn on how many seats it would gain but said its record in local government was a good one and he predicted it would consolidate its position in its existing strongholds in Essex and South Yorkshire.  "We will make gains. To try and guess how many is virtually impossible. In Thurrock, I think we will become the biggest party on that council, in Rotherham we have a chance of becoming the biggest party on that council.  "There are 500 local UKIP councillors. Our local base is growing, the people who have had elected have behaved, on the whole, pretty well and been very diligent and worked very hard. Yes, we will improve."  There has been speculation about the future of the party, and a possible change in direction, whatever the outcome of June's referendum on EU membership.  Mr Farage said if there was a narrow vote to stay in the EU, a lot of Conservative and Labour supporters would be unable to reconcile themselves with the result and their party leadership's stance and UKIP could find itself "a lot bigger than it is now".  If there was a vote to leave, he said UKIP would need to "stay around" to ensure that the people's will was "implemented" but he conceded that it would need to show it could talk about issues other than Europe.  And he rejected suggestions that UKIP - which only managed to get one MP elected in last year's general election despite winning 12% of the vote - was treading water nationally, citing a recent YouGov opinion poll which put it on 20%.  "We are now at the highest we have ever been as a party - what more can I do?"	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36192947	World of Warcraft invites legacy server team for talks	The team behind a fan-run version of World of Warcraft has secured a meeting with the game's developer after a public campaign.  In April, developer Blizzard Entertainment shut down Nostalrius, an unofficial server running an older, unsupported version of the game.  That led to more than 250,000 fans signing a petition for Blizzard to support so-called legacy servers.  It has now agreed to meet the team from Nostalrius to discuss the issue.  The private server ran an original version of the popular role-playing game, sometimes called a "vanilla" version, which reflects the game as it was released in 2004.  In the years since launch, WoW has been updated and patched with several expansions, which some fans feel has altered the fundamental experience.  Nostalrius was shut down in April after Blizzard issued a legal warning, igniting a public debate among fans on the issue. Now the developer says it will invite the Nostalrius team to its California headquarters for discussions - though a date has not been fixed.  The company also suggested the possibility of what it called a "pristine" server, which would do away with some of the modern game's boosts and services, but run within the current version.  Nostalrius says formal meetings with Blizzard will make it a community advocate - and it hopes the company will take over the responsibility to run legacy servers legally.  "We feel we are now not only the admins of a private server, we are also the ambassadors of a larger movement for the entire World of Warcraft community that wants to see game history restored," they wrote in a forum post.  "It is a major responsibility. Our top priority and only focus now is to fulfil the needs of this community, by carrying your voice to Blizzard directly."  Blizzard has never supported legacy servers itself, making illegal private servers the only option for experiencing the "classic" game.  Blizzard said the issue of "classic" servers had been discussed for years, but claimed it could not be implemented "without extreme difficulty". It also said it could not have allowed the private Nostalrius server to continue, as "failure to protect against intellectual property infringement would damage Blizzard's rights".  Fans reacted with mixed views to Blizzard's tentative discussions. Some fear that official legacy servers could pull company resources away from developing new content for the main version of the game. Others - including former WoW developer Mark Kern - said legacy servers were still needed.  "WoW is an important game - it's part of gaming history - but there's no legal way for people to enjoy its earlier versions or see where it all came from," Mr Kern said in a video addressed to Blizzard.  "Unlike the old days, they can't just boot up a floppy disk or slip in a CD-Rom.  "The original game is gone from the world forever and legacy servers are the only way to preserve this vital part of gaming culture."  At its peak in 2010, World of Warcraft attracted almost 12 million subscribers, but today it has about five million paying customers. Nostalrius had about 150,000 active members when it was shut down on 10 April.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36191165	Has Craig Wright proved he's Bitcoin's Satoshi Nakamoto?	Scepticism has greeted a claim by Craig Wright that he is the inventor of Bitcoin. His claim has been subjected to scrutiny on social media, discussion forums and message boards. Many say the evidence has been found wanting.  On 2 May, Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright publicly claimed to be the creator of the Bitcoin virtual currency.  In interviews with the BBC, the Economist and GQ, he said he was the man behind Satoshi Nakamoto - the pseudonym used by whoever dreamed up Bitcoin in email exchanges with cryptographers and developers in the early days of the virtual currency.  His claim was backed by Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, and Jon Matonis, an economist and a founding director of the same organisation.  Some. In demonstrations to the Bitcoin experts, the BBC and the Economist, he used the Electrum Bitcoin wallet to sign a message using private keys from early Bitcoin blocks widely assumed to belong to Satoshi Nakamoto.  But as the Economist said in its report about Mr Wright, such demonstrations can be "stage-managed" and many doubters have said it was poor practice to let him use his own laptop and software of his choosing for this demonstration.  However, Mr Andresen's encounter with Mr Wright was more rigorous. In that case, a Windows laptop was bought from a nearby shop, unboxed and the Electrum wallet software installed on it.  Mr Wright then signed an arbitrary message - "Gavin's favorite number is eleven. CSW" - with a key from an early block. The signed message was put on a USB stick, moved to the new laptop and checked. This revealed the signature to be valid.  No. In addition, Mr Wright also posted information on his blog that he said would show that he was Satoshi, again because of the digital signature linked to those early blocks.  Many people jumped on this evidence and soon after revealed that there was no digital signature in it. Instead, it uses a short list of numbers any competent Googler could find. The string of numbers comes from a 2009 bitcoin transaction carried out by Satoshi.  In limbo. On the one hand, we have two key figures in the Bitcoin community convinced Craig Wright is Satoshi. Others have joined them.  On the other, we have a huge number of sceptics utterly unconvinced by evidence that is very weakly linked to Satoshi. Developer Patrick McKenzie pointed out that anyone could use it to claim they were Bitcoin's progenitor.  Mr Andresen did entertain the possibility that he has been "bamboozled" by an elaborate effort to make the test he saw look more real than it actually was. But, he said, he was still convinced that Craig Wright is Satoshi.  With more proof. Many, including the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones, have called on Craig Wright to spend some of the bitcoins locked up in those early blocks to demonstrate that he has control of them.  However, as others have pointed out, all this would show is that he has access to the private keys for these bitcoins, not that he was Satoshi.  Some suggest the confusion around Satoshi's identity has arisen because it was a name adopted by the small group of developers that worked on Bitcoin in its early days. This group involved Mr Wright, Hal Finney and David Kleiman. As the only surviving member of that group Mr Wright could claim to be Satoshi but would not have access to all the data that could be used to definitively prove this assertion.  The Economist has publicly called on Mr Wright to provide more proof. That could soon be forthcoming, said a statement from his PR agency.  "In the coming days Dr Wright will provide further evidence as to him being Satoshi and the creator of Bitcoin by moving a coin from an early block."  Not really. Bitcoin watchers and journalists have been seeking the man behind Satoshi for years. During that time the focus has fallen on Finnish economists, Japanese mathematicians, cybercriminals and Japanese-American physicists. All the people named in those searches have denied being Satoshi.  In December 2015, Wired and Gizmodo put forward Craig Wright's name as a potential candidate after receiving documents and emails reportedly stolen from him that showed his involvement with the virtual currency.  After reviewing the evidence, Wired remained unsure, saying: "Either Wright invented bitcoin, or he's a brilliant hoaxer who very badly wants us to believe he did."  We don't know. Critics of Mr Wright point to his continuing dispute with the Australian tax authorities as one reason why he might need a way to explain away his possession of large amounts of bitcoins.  For his part Mr Wright said he is undergoing audits by the Australian Tax Office over the amount of tax he has to pay but this is complicated by the fact that the ATO does not understand bitcoins and how they might be valued.  Because Bitcoin has become much more than just a technology project. There is a definite libertarian ideology bound up with it. Some commentators have suggested it is so toxic that it deserves to "die in a fire".  Also, Bitcoin's community is currently debating how the currency itself should evolve. Some want it to remain a pure net-connected currency but others, including Craig Wright, want it to become a more general payment system. If Mr Wright was confirmed as Satoshi he could lend weight to one side of the debate.  Indeed, he said, during all the years of silence he has not been idle. Instead, he has many ideas about how to expand the reach of Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain accounting system.	tech

The data-sharing agreement, revealed by New Scientist, includes full names as well as patient histories.  Google says it will use the data to develop an early warning system for patients at risk of developing acute kidney injuries.  But critics have questioned why it needs the data of all patients to create such a specific app.  Under the data-sharing agreement, Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind will have access to all of the data of patients from the Royal Free, Barnet and Chase Farm hospitals in London going back over the past five years and continuing until 2017.  Sam Smith, a co-ordinator of patient data campaign group MedConfidential, said: "The big question is why they want it. This a very rich data set. If you are someone who went to the A&E department, why is your data in this?"  Google said that it needed general data in order to identify patients who might be at risk of developing acute kidney injuries (AKI). It plans to use the data to develop an app known as Streams that will alert doctors when someone is at risk of developing AKI.  AKI is a contributing factor in up to 20% of emergency hospital admissions, according to the NHS. It estimates that around a quarter of cases are preventable.  It is not clear how exactly Google will use the data to provide this early warning system but the BBC understands that no artificial intelligence will be used.  Dominic King, a senior scientist at Google DeepMind, said: "Access to timely and relevant clinical data is essential for doctors and nurses looking for signs of patient deterioration. This work focuses on acute kidney injuries that contribute to 40,000 deaths a year in the UK, many of which are preventable.  "The kidney specialists who have led this work are confident that the alerts our system generates will transform outcomes for their patients. For us to generate these alerts it is necessary for us to look at a range of tests taken at different time intervals."  It is believed that doctors at the Royal Free approached Google about developing the system.  Google has not ruled out the use of the data for other purposes but said it will only ever be used for improving healthcare and will never be linked to other Google accounts or products.  Google does have big ambitions in healthcare.  In 2013 it launched Calico, a firm set up to look at ways to tackle ageing while X, Google's research arm, launched Baseline in 2014 - an ambitious plan to map genetic information to gain a picture of what makes humans healthy.	tech

The announcement came hours before a ruling that could have blocked Nvidia from importing some of its products into the US.  Although the agreement brings the dispute to a close, Nvidia said the terms of the deal were limited.  "The settlement includes the licensing of a small number of patents by each company to the other, but no broad cross-licensing of patents or other compensation," it said.  Samsung added: "We are happy to resolve this dispute through a fair settlement."  Neither company is disclosing any further details.  The clash was first made public in September 2014, when Nvidia held a news conference during which its chief executive declared the South Korean tech giant was "using our [graphics] technology for free in their devices".  Jen-Hsun Huang went on to say that his firm was suing the smartphone-maker after months of failed talks.  Two months later, Samsung counter-sued claiming its innovations had been used without permission in Nvidia's Shield tablets and chips.  When the International Trade Commission - a US agency that investigates patent disputes - looked into the matter, it ruled that Samsung's graphics processors had not infringed Nvidia's patents.  But in a follow-up decision, it said Nvidia's chips had violated three of Samsung's patents.  The ITC had been due to announce whether this warranted an import ban, but will no longer do so because the case has been dismissed.	tech

Magistrate Alicia G Rosenburg signed a seizure warrant for the "fingerprint on iPhone device" of Paytsar Bkhchadzhyan, of Los Angeles, on 25 February, while she was in police custody.  It authorised officers to "depress" her fingerprints on the sensor.  Campaigners say making suspects decrypt their phones means they are testifying against themselves, which contravenes the US constitution's fifth amendment.  Apple's Touch ID system is one of two ways to unlock the encrypted contents of an iPhone - the other being to input the passcode. But the fingerprint can be used only within 48 hours of the phone being locked.  It has been argued that while a passcode is "contents of the mind", and thus protected under the fifth amendment, a fingerprint is physical evidence, and can be treated like a blood sample or prints recovered from a crime scene.  University of Dayton law professor Susan Brenner said smartphones contained a great deal of personal information and "a lot of that could be incriminating".  "By showing you opened the phone, you showed that you have control over it," she said.  "It is the same as if she went home and pulled out paper documents - she has produced it."  If a person could not refuse to put their finger on a biometric reader to decrypt data for the government, "then encryption really isn't worth much", said Prof Brenner.  "The result would be we would create content at our peril, as we would have no way to secure it from state investigators."  Meanwhile, in Pennsylvania, a man remains in jail for refusing to decrypt two hard drives investigators suspect contain indecent images of children.  In that case, the Electronic Frontier Foundation campaign group said compelling suspects to decrypt data violated fifth amendment rights.  "Complying with the order would communicate facts that are not foregone conclusions already known to the government," it said.	tech

A suit filed in the Northern District of Illinois is seeking to reclassify drivers as employees rather than contractors.  In previous settlements, Uber agreed to pay up to $100m (£68m) to drivers.  Crucially though, it did not have to reclassify them as employees.  Reclassification of US Uber drivers would mean they would be entitled to a range of benefits, including sick leave, overtime, health insurance and a minimum wage.  Uber did make a few concessions in the Massachusetts and California lawsuits, including promising to create a drivers' association and rewriting its policy about terminating contracts.  At the time of the settlement, many of Uber's critics were disappointed that it would no longer go to court.  One of the lawyers for the drivers, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said that there was "significant risk of losing", due to a federal appeals court reviewing whether drivers can sue as a group.  In response to the new lawsuit, Uber told the BBC: "Nearly 90% of drivers say the main reason they use Uber is because they love being their own boss.  "As employees, drivers would have set shifts, earn a fixed hourly wage, and lose the ability to drive with other ridesharing apps - as well as the personal flexibility they most value."	tech

He said the "golden circle of the media establishment" was "obsessed" with leadership questions, whereas voters were more concerned with inequality.  Pollsters have suggested Labour could lose about 150 seats.  Mr Corbyn also said an anti-Semitism row in Labour was being "dealt with".  He pointed to an inquiry led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of campaign group Liberty, and said "only a very small number" of cases of anti-Semitism had been identified to date.  On Thursday, Labour will be defending the large council gains it made in 2012, the last time the seats were contested.  "We are not going to lose seats," Mr Corbyn told the BBC as he launched his party's election poster.  "We are looking to gain seats where we can, but these elections are being fought on the issues of every different community across the country."  Mr Corbyn overwhelmingly won last year's Labour leadership vote despite lacking the support of most of the party's MPs.  On Sunday, Mr Corbyn's ally Len McCluskey said the anti-Semitism row was being used by opponents of Mr Corbyn within Labour to undermine his leadership.  Asked about reports of a possible leadership challenge, Mr Corbyn said: "I'm here. I'm going on," replying "of course" when asked if he would stand in a leadership contest if there was another one.  People in the media were "obsessed" with the leadership question, he said, advising people to focus instead on the "grotesque level of inequality".

In February, the internet company announced it was offering its core business for sale, after several years of falling advertising sales.  She has attempted to turn the company's fortunes around with a mobile-first strategy since 2012.  But critics say she has failed to stem the decline.  A filing to the US Securities and Exchanges Commission says Ms Mayer would receive a package of cash, stock and other benefits is she was removed as chief executive within a year of any sale.  The internet media company's fortunes have changed drastically in the past decade, with sales falling from $7.2bn in 2008 to $4.6bn last year.  Ms Mayer received $36m in compensation last year, compared to $42.1m in 2014.  Other executives will also receive big severance packages in the event of of a sale. The company's chief financial officer, Ken Goldman, would receive more than $16.1m, and chief revenue officer Lisa Utzschneider would net $19.9m.  "I don't think this management team has done anything to merit a huge payout," Eric Jackson, managing director of SpringOwl Asset Management - a Yahoo shareholder - told the Associated Press.  A large part of the internet company's $32bn value is attributed to its shareholding in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. It also owns the online blogging platform Tumblr and photo-sharing site Flickr.  Companies including US communications giant Verizon and the UK-based owner of the Daily Mail newspaper have been linked to the sale of Yahoo, and analysts believe a deal could be agreed this year.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168863	Craig Wright revealed as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto	Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright has publicly identified himself as Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto.  His admission follows years of speculation about who came up with the original ideas underlying the digital cash system.  Mr Wright has provided technical proof to back up his claim using coins known to be owned by Bitcoin's creator.  Prominent members of the Bitcoin community and its core development team say they have confirmed his claims.  But many others in the Bitcoin world are asking for more proof.  Mr Wright has revealed his identity to three media organisations - the BBC, the Economist and GQ.  At the meeting with the BBC, Mr Wright digitally signed messages using cryptographic keys created during the early days of Bitcoin's development. The keys are inextricably linked to blocks of bitcoins known to have been created or "mined" by Satoshi Nakamoto.  "These are the blocks used to send 10 bitcoins to Hal Finney in January [2009] as the first bitcoin transaction," said Mr Wright during his demonstration.  Renowned cryptographer Hal Finney was one of the engineers who helped turn Mr Wright's ideas into the Bitcoin protocol, he said.  "I was the main part of it, but other people helped me," he said.  Soon after Mr Wright went public, Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, published a blog backing his claim.  "I believe Craig Steven Wright is the person who invented Bitcoin," he wrote.  Jon Matonis, an economist and one of the founding directors of the Bitcoin Foundation, said he was convinced that Mr Wright was who he claimed to be.  "During the London proof sessions, I had the opportunity to review the relevant data along three distinct lines: cryptographic, social, and technical," he said.  "It is my firm belief that Craig Wright satisfies all three categories."  Mr Wright said he planned to release information that would allow others to cryptographically verify that he is Satoshi Nakamoto.  Not everyone has been convinced by Mr Wright's claims and the technical proof he put in his blog. Some cryptographers and developers who worked through the information provided said they had trouble getting verifiable information out of it.  Security expert Dan Kaminsky said the procedure was almost "maliciously resistant" to validation.  Many people have called on Mr Wright to go further in proving his identify.  Bitcoin is often referred to as a new kind of currency.  But it may be best to think of its units being virtual tokens rather than physical coins or notes.  However, like all currencies its value is determined by how much people are willing to exchange it for.  To process Bitcoin transactions, a procedure called "mining" must take place, which involves a computer solving a difficult mathematical problem with a 64-digit solution.  For each problem solved, one block of Bitcoins is processed. In addition the miner is rewarded with new Bitcoins.  This provides an incentive for people to provide computer processing power to solve the problems.  To compensate for the growing power of computer chips, the difficulty of the puzzles is adjusted to ensure a steady stream of new Bitcoins are produced each day.  There are currently about 15 million Bitcoins in existence.  To receive a Bitcoin, a user must have a Bitcoin address - a string of 27-34 letters and numbers - which acts as a kind of virtual post-box to and from which the Bitcoins are sent.  Since there is no registry of these addresses, people can use them to protect their anonymity when making a transaction.  These addresses are in turn stored in Bitcoin wallets, which are used to manage savings.  They operate like privately run bank accounts - with the proviso that if the data is lost, so are the Bitcoins owned.  By going public, Mr Wright hopes to put an end to press speculation about the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. The New Yorker, Fast Company, Newsweek and many other media organisations have all conducted long investigations seeking Bitcoin's creator and named many different people as candidates.  In December 2015, two magazines, Wired and Gizmodo, named Mr Wright as a candidate after receiving documents believed to be stolen from him that revealed his involvement with the project.  Soon after these stories were published, authorities in Australia raided the home of Mr Wright. The Australian Taxation Office said the raid was linked to a long-running investigation into tax payments rather than Bitcoin.  Questioned about this raid, Mr Wright said he was cooperating fully with the ATO.  "We have lawyers negotiating with them over how much I have to pay," he said.  The stories in December have led to many more journalists and others pursuing him and people he knows, he said.  "There are lots of stories out there that have been made up and I don't like it hurting those people I care about," he said. "I don't want any of them to be impacted by this."  "I have not done this because it is what I wanted. It's not because of my choice," he said, adding that he had no plans to become the figurehead for bitcoins.  "I really do not want to be the public face of anything," he said, expressing regret that he had been forced to reveal his identity.  "I would rather not do it," he said. "I want to work, I want to keep doing what I want to do. I don't want money. I don't want fame. I don't want adoration. I just want to be left alone."  Bitcoins are now accepted as payment for a vast variety of goods and services - everything from international money transfers to ransoms for data encrypted by computer viruses. There are currently about 15.5 million bitcoins in circulation. Each one is worth about $449 (£306).  Satoshi Nakamoto is believed to have amassed about one million Bitcoins which would give him a net worth, if all were converted to cash, of about $450m.	tech

The video-sharing website said it had acquired streaming start-up VHX for an undisclosed sum.  Its white-label platform will let people launch their own-brand services, complete with smartphone apps and a website, using Vimeo's technology.  But an analyst said the video-streaming market was "increasingly crowded".  Prominent video-makers such as Disney, Showtime and HBO are turning to subscription online video to counter falling cable television revenues, as consumers increasingly reject expensive cable television packages.  Online talent agency Fullscreen and video giant YouTube have also launched "premium" services to bolster income.  "When it comes to longer form or premium productions, the economics of producing it on the free web just don't work out," Fullscreen founder George Strompolos told the BBC.  Industry analyst Tom Harrington of Enders said subscription services offered a "superior" experience for consumers.  "There's some great stuff on YouTube but there are hundreds of millions of hours of rubbish as well," he told the BBC.  "In terms of connecting to your intended audience, without distraction, an off-the-shelf streaming service would be superior.  "But, given that Vimeo has spent over a decade concentrating on creating a name and reputation synonymous with quality, the provision of white-label services seems a choice contrary to its business so far."  Vimeo chief executive Kerry Trainor said the online video industry was "expanding from a few, mainstream subscription services into a flourishing world of interest-based streaming channels" and that Vimeo would help establish the "next generation of premium video channels".  The company, which does not publish its earnings, said 1.2 million video purchases had been made on its website since it launched in 2004.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36180572	Len McCluskey: Anti-Semitism row used to undermine Corbyn	A row about anti-Semitism is being used by Jeremy Corbyn's opponents within Labour to undermine his leadership, Unite chief Len McCluskey says.  Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour's biggest donor, attacked a "cynical attempt to manipulate anti-Semitism for political aims".  Another Corbyn ally, Diane Abbott, said party members had been "smeared".  It comes after controversial comments by ex-mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Naz Shah saw both suspended from the party.  Mr Corbyn told a May Day rally in London his party stood "absolutely against anti-Semitism in any form".  Mr Livingstone, the former London mayor, was suspended from the party after saying Adolf Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s "before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews".  Speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 live, Mr McCluskey said Labour had been right to suspend Mr Livingstone for his "bizarre" comments.  But he described the wider controversy as "mood music" being exploited by political enemies of Mr Corbyn.  The Unite chief said the row had been "got up" by the right-wing press, "aided and abetted by those Labour MPs who wake up and think what stick can we beat Jeremy with?"  He is in charge of the union which donates the most money to Labour. And he sees the row over anti-Semitism as part of wider attempts to undermine Jeremy Corbyn's leadership - not just from the "right wing press", as he calls it, but from Labour MPs.  He knows some prominent party members are prepared to blame their own party leadership for what they expect to be poor election results this week.  So he is firing a shot across their bows to dissuade any of them from launching a leadership challenge.  The nature of the challenge is far from certain - Jeremy Corbyn's opponents have been described by one insider as "rival militias" who can't agree on an alternative, or on the timing of an assault.  But it would be wrong entirely to conflate the anti-Semitism controversy with anti-Corbyn plotting.  The anger some MPs feel over the handling of the issue isn't synthetic, and they fear it has harmed the party's reputation and not just that of the leader.  Mr McCluskey said he did not think there would be a formal leadership challenge to Mr Corbyn, but added that any MP "stupid enough to try" would have to "be accountable for their actions".  Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Ms Abbott, the shadow international development secretary, said Mr Livingstone's remarks had been "extremely offensive", but defended the party's handling of the row.  She said there had been 12 reported cases of alleged anti-Semitism within the party since Mr Corbyn became leader, and each had led to a suspension - including Mr Livingstone who was suspended "within hours".  "It's something of a smear against ordinary members to say the party has a problem with anti-Semitism," she said.  But Labour's candidate for Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warned the row engulfing his party had harmed his chances of being elected.  Mr Khan told the Observer Mr Livingstone's comments had made it "more difficult" for Jewish voters to support him in next week's election.  Labour is holding an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in its ranks - but the leadership's response to the allegations has been criticised by some Labour MPs.  Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, ex-minister Ben Bradshaw told the Sunday Politics members were "furious" at how the situation had been handled, and Labour MP Louise Ellman said the response had been "much too slow".  Ms Ellman, who is Jewish, said she had been subject to anti-Semitic abuse herself at a meeting of the local party. A complaint is being investigated.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World this Weekend, Labour donor Michael Foster, who gave the party £400,000 before the general election where he also stood as a candidate, said some members of the party's leadership "vilify Jews as part of their political shtick".  He called for the inquiry, led by former Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti, to be widened, and said he would not donate to the party nationally because of the leadership's approach.  Senior figures within Israeli politics also expressed their concerns about the party.  The new Israeli ambassador to London said elements of left-wing parties were "deluding themselves" if they presumed there was no problem with anti-Semitism.  Mark Regev said comments in the last few weeks had crossed from criticism of Israeli government policies to "demonising and a vilification of" the Jewish state and perpetuating racist stereotypes.  Israel's Labour leader Isaac Herzog also said he had been "appalled and outraged by the recent examples of anti-Semitism by senior Labour Party officials".  Mr Livingstone's comments were "horrific and unthinkable for a British politician in the 21st Century", he added.  The anti-Semitism row erupted last week when Bradford West MP Naz Shah was suspended after sharing a Facebook post suggesting Israel should be moved to America.  Mr Livingstone defended her in a BBC interview, saying that she was not anti-Semitic.  He went on to say: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel."  Mr Livingstone was subsequently suspended but stood by his comments, saying he was "not sorry for telling the truth".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36177333	Ken Livingstone stands by Hitler comments	Ken Livingstone has stood by his recent comments about Hitler, saying he was "not sorry for telling the truth".  He said he "regretted" the disruption his comments had caused but "I believe what I said is true".  The former London mayor was suspended from the Labour party on Thursday after saying Hitler had supported Zionism in the 1930s.  He made the comments while defending Labour MP Naz Shah over accusations she was anti-Semitic.  During an interview on LBC, Mr Livingstone repeatedly refused to apologise for making the comments, saying he was sorry if his views had upset Jewish people but he had simply made a "statement of fact" that had also been made by Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  "I never regret saying something that is true," he said.  "How can I have hurt and offended the Jewish community when the prime minister of Israel said exactly the same thing?"  "If you look at what this is all about, it's not about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party... What this is all about is actually the struggle of the embittered old Blairite MPs to try to get rid of Jeremy Corbyn."  Labour is to hold an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in its ranks.  It said the inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of human rights campaign group Liberty, would consult with the Jewish community and other minority groups, after claims a strain of party members held anti-Semitic views.  The row erupted after Ms Shah was found to have made comments on Facebook before becoming an MP, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States. She later apologised and was suspended from the party.  But Mr Livingstone defended the Bradford West MP, saying anti-Zionism was not the same as anti-Semitism.  He told BBC London: "When Hitler won his election in 1932, his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him in front of TV cameras of being a "Nazi apologist".  And he was later suspended by Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  Mr Corbyn tweeted on Saturday: "There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of racism in the Labour Party, or anywhere in society."  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "I just wish Ken would have apologised for some of the offence that he's caused. I know he's said he regrets what he's said, but I think he should now apologise."  The row comes less than a week before local elections in England, and for the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Mr Livingstone, who has been a close ally of Mr Corbyn and his left-wing ideals, said he believed the attacks against him were coming from the right-wing of the party and were really aimed at undermining the leadership.  "The really appalling thing here is dishonest MPs who know that what I said is true have stirred up all this nonsense because they want to damage our chances at the local election so they then have a chance of undermining Jeremy."  Shadow cabinet minister Jonathan Ashworth said it was Mr Livingstone who was undermining Mr Corbyn, and urged him to "put a sock in it".  He told the BBC: "I was offended by Ken's remarks. I think Ken crossed a line. I'm not a bitter former Blairite... I am proud to serve in Jeremy's shadow cabinet."  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu provoked widespread criticism in October when he said a Palestinian leader persuaded the Nazis to carry out the Holocaust.  Mr Netanyahu insisted Adolf Hitler had only wanted to expel Jews from Europe, but that Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini had told him: "Burn them."  However, the chief historian at Israel's memorial to the Holocaust said this account was factually incorrect.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36175660	Labour anti-Semitism row: Jeremy Corbyn to launch inquiry	Jeremy Corbyn is to hold an independent inquiry into anti-Semitism and other forms of racism in the Labour Party.  The inquiry, led by Shami Chakrabarti, former head of campaign group Liberty, will consult with the Jewish community and other minority groups, Labour said.  Mr Corbyn will also propose a new "code of conduct" on racism at Labour's national executive committee in May.  It comes after the party suspended MP Naz Shah and ex-London mayor Ken Livingstone amid anti-Semitism claims.  The code of conduct will include guidance on "acceptable behaviour and use of language" and make "explicitly clear for the first time that Labour will not tolerate any form of racism, including anti-Semitism, in the party", a statement said.  The inquiry's vice-chairman will be Professor David Feldman, director of the Pears Institute for the Study of Anti-Semitism.  The inquiry, which will report in two months, will set out "clear and transparent" rules on how the party should deal with allegations of racism and anti-Semitism and propose training programmes for parliamentary candidates, MPs and councillors.  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said Jeremy Corbyn would be hoping the announcement would "calm what was now a very angry, volatile atmosphere within his party".  Mr Corbyn said Labour was an anti-racist party "to its core", and the Jewish community had been at the heart of the Labour party and progressive politics in Britain for more than 100 years.  "There is no place for anti-Semitism or any form of racism in the Labour party, or anywhere in society, and we will make sure that our party is a welcoming home to members of all communities," he said.  The Labour leader said he had taken "decisive action" over any such allegations since he became leader.  The row, which comes less than a week before local elections in England, and for the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, exploded on Thursday when Mr Livingstone claimed Hitler supported Zionism "before he went mad".  He made the comments in an interview with BBC Radio London, in which he defended Ms Shah, the party's MP for Bradford West.  Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative candidate for London Mayor, said it was "not a Ken Livingstone problem - it's a Labour party problem".  He told the BBC: "There is a streak running through the Labour party - I don't think the Labour party even denies it - where anti-Semitism of the most aggressive form has become normalised."  There will be those Labour MPs who welcome the inquiry as measurable progress, but will it satisfy Jeremy Corbyn's most committed critics? No it won't.  They don't trust his instincts. They remember him sharing platforms in the past with militants from Hamas, or from Iran.  They resent the fact he draws support from some far-left individuals and groups who have been associated with anti-Semitism in the past.  More fundamentally, this is just one component of a charge sheet for them that touches on Jeremy Corbyn's pure left instincts and his basic competence.  The tension beneath the surface between these rival groups in the Labour Party borders and crosses over into hatred.  It will come to the surface after the local and national elections next week and will likely boil over when the European referendum is settled one way or another in June.  Ms Shah was suspended on Wednesday over comments on Facebook, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States. She later apologised.  In the interview, Mr Livingstone said: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him of being a "Nazi apologist" in front of TV cameras.  And Jonathan Ashworth, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, told BBC Radio 4 that Mr Livingstone's comments were "deeply offensive, it was vile".  Labour MP Ruth Smeeth said it had been a "horrendous" week for the party but hoped the inquiry would "help us now rebuild".  Mr Livingstone was suspended by Mr Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  Anushka Asthana, political editor at the Guardian, who was following Mr Corbyn for an interview on the day the row erupted, told the BBC the Labour leader tried to carry on with his planned visits before advisors made it clear he needed to take action.  "It was obviously quite a difficult thing for him to do... he is an old friend of Ken Livingstone," she said.  "[Labour] had to set up this inquiry because of all the questions, but there is a reluctance, I think, among the inner circle to accept that all of this is around anti-Semitism. But they have to shut this down. There is fury throughout the party."  Jonathan Sacerdoti, from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, welcomed Mr Corbyn's inquiry but said the party was still reacting too slowly.  "We've seen more and more of these stories coming out about people in the Labour party, and it can't be denied that the modern left has within it a strain that does seem to have anti-Semitic views.  "That's a problem the Labour Party has been very slow to acknowledge and very slow to deal with."  On Friday, Mr Livingstone told Sky News he would make his case citing a book by controversial American Marxist historian Lenni Brenner, who he met in the 1980s.  "I'll just produce the evidence... it's hard for somebody to decide to suspend me from the party here when all this was there 30 years ago in the public domain and nobody raised a peep," he said.	politics

After the "Stair Wars" in which a Labour MP waged running verbal combat with Ken Livingstone, and ignited questions about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the warring factions have suddenly fallen all but silent.  Peace, though, has not broken out. Anything but.  It's a momentary ceasefire. On both sides, people are keeping their heads down - judging it too dangerous to speak up.  Today, Jeremy Corbyn cancelled his campaigning trip to Wales to avoid unwanted media attention. Media attention is supposed to be the point!  The First Minister of Wales, Carwen Jones, admitted Mr Corbyn isn't a hit with everyone on the doorsteps.  "Yes there are some people saying to me I'm unsure about Jeremy Corbyn. There are others who take the opposite view. What we are finding is that fewer and fewer people are mentioning him on the doorstep."  Mr Corbyn's critics - and enemies - are also keeping quiet.  In private their mood is ferocious.  They want Ken Livingstone expelled, and Mr Corbyn to take anti-Semitism in the party more seriously. So why the phoney peace?  Behind the scenes, fear is spreading of what some expect to be poor results for Labour in Thursday's elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities.  "Outside London, it's looking dire," one told me.  And now, Mr Corbyn's enemies - who are under constant watch by the leaders' allies - are anxious to avoid being blamed for making things worse by showing disloyalty to their embattled leader.  They expect those accusations to be levelled anyway.  There's mutual suspicion and hostility bordering on hatred between the rival wings and factions of the Labour Party.  It's been a messy, chaotic few days. Acrimonious in public, worse in private.  Some action is coming on Labour's approach to racism and anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn will speak out. Rules changes explicitly declaring zero tolerance of racism look likely.  But there are fears a good deal of damage has already been done, and the Labour Party will pay a price at the polls.  The election results, when they come, will inevitably subjected to rival, probably diametrically opposing interpretations within the Labour Party.  But from all I'm hearing from sources in the opposing camps, anything that can be read as a poor night in Thursday's elections will escalate the in-fighting to a new pitch.  A fierce confrontation over Labour's future direction and leadership now looks unavoidable.	politics

The Lib Dem leader conceded his party had "a battle" on its hands.  But he said Labour's woes present it with a "huge opportunity" to show itself as "an effective opposition".  He claims membership has increased by 50% since last year's general election, when the party was nearly wiped out at Westminster.  In an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Farron said the elections were "important UK-wide" because the country is faced with "a divided and divisive Labour Party when we ought to be talking about a Conservative Party that's attacking junior doctors, reducing police numbers and effectively privatising our schools".  Told that voters do not know who he is, Mr Farron said: "That's the job we have got. We've got a battle to get back to the centre of British politics and people's attentions and we can only do that by winning some elections."  He said it took former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown two to three years to get 50% name recognition.  "The point is you don't get prissy or pompous or selfish about this, you roll your sleeves up and get things done, and frankly given the state of Britain's most ineffective opposition in living memory - the Labour Party - it's in the interests of British democracy that the Lib Dems recover next Thursday. I hope we will."  Mr Farron also defended his party's use of the House of Lords to defeat government legislation despite describing it as "undemocratic".  "We don't agree with first past the post or the way the House of Commons is elected but it's the system we've got so we will use it."  Britain goes to the polls on Thursday in the biggest set of elections, outside of a general election, for some years.

Labour was considering changes to its rules to send "a clear signal" of its "zero tolerance" towards anti-Semitism.  Mr Livingstone was suspended after claiming Hitler supported Zionism "before he went mad".  Labour has been beset in recent weeks by growing claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks.  Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said allegations must be dealt with "much more speedily in the future".  What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  He told BBC One's Question Time on Thursday that he did not think the party was anti-Semitic but added: "These allegations, when they are surfacing, have not been dealt with properly and quickly enough."  But Mr Watson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that party leader Jeremy Corbyn did "act swiftly" to suspend his ally of 40 years, Mr Livingstone.  He said Mr Livingstone's comments were "vile" adding: "To link Hitler and Zionism in the way he did must have been designed to create offence." But he said it was for Labour's ruling national executive committee to decide whether to expel him from the party.  What is most satisfying for Jeremy Corbyn's internal opponents is that they feel they have found a "wedge" issue to detach him from some of his support.  Many of his MPs don't like his views on a range of issues but to attack him for - for example - wanting to scrap nuclear weapons merely strengthens his support amongst newer, more left-wing members.  But while some of those members may have made offensive comments, many, many more despise anti-Semitism - so Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to those accused of it will be scrutinised closely by them.  The anti-Semitism row could yet become the "soft underbelly" of his leadership.  In the meantime Mr Watson said he and Mr Corbyn had been looking at whether "Labour's own structures" needed changing "to make sure that we send a very clear signal to people in our party that we will have a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism".  "Do we need to change our rules to explicitly rule out racism and specifically include anti-Semitism in that?" he said.  "We are going to deal with this."  Meanwhile BBC Wales understands that Mr Corbyn cancelled a visit to Wales, where Labour activists are campaigning ahead of the assembly elections, amid fears it would be overshadowed by the anti-Semitism row.  The row exploded on Thursday after a radio interview that Mr Livingstone did with BBC Radio London, defending Naz Shah, the party's MP for Bradford West, who had been suspended on Wednesday over comments on Facebook.  In it he said: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews."  He was later confronted outside the BBC's studios by Labour MP John Mann, who accused him of being a "Nazi apologist" in front of TV cameras. Other Labour MPs condemned Mr Livingstone's comments.  He was later suspended by Mr Corbyn, who said there had been "grave concerns" about the language used.  On Friday, Mr Livingstone told Sky News he would make his case citing a book by controversial American Marxist historian Lenni Brenner, who he met in the 1980s.  "I'll just produce the evidence and I mean it's hard for somebody to decide to suspend me from the party here when all this was there 30 years ago in the public domain and nobody raised a peep," he said.  Labour peer Lord Sugar said Mr Livingstone had "lost the plot" and was "obsessed with Hitler, concentration camps and Jews".  "They will wait for it to blow over a little bit and they will find some way of him coming back in, slipping back into the Labour fold," he told BBC Radio 5 Live.  But Jon Lansman, chairman of Momentum, a grassroots network of Corbyn supporters, said that while Mr Livingstone's comments were "very ill-judged, wrong and offensive" to "call Ken a Nazi apologist is ridiculous".  He said: "Just as the Tories have an interest in stoking up the flames of whatever crisis is here... largely a crisis of perception... so do some people in the Labour Party and I'm afraid John Mann is one of them. John Mann is no supporter of Jeremy Corbyn."  On Wednesday Ms Shah was suspended, pending an investigation, over comments she made on Facebook before she became an MP, including a suggestion that Israel should be moved to the United States.  She has apologised but it has prompted claims from senior Labour figures that the party was not doing enough to tackle growing anti-Semitism in its ranks.	politics

Mr Hammond is the first UK foreign secretary to travel to the Caribbean country in an official capacity since its communist revolution in 1959.  He said there would be new "co-operation agreements" on energy, finance, education and culture.  Mr Hammond's two-day visit follows one by US President Barack Obama in March.  As with all visiting dignitaries, Mr Hammond's first stop was in Revolution Square, Havana, to lay a wreath for the island's independence hero, Jose Marti.  He then held talks with his Cuban counterpart, Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla.  The foreign secretary is taking part in a series of meetings to discuss social and economic changes, human rights and the fight against global health threats such as the Zika virus.  He will also sign a bilateral agreement restructuring Cuba's debt to the UK.  "Britain and Cuba have outlooks on the world and systems of government that are very different," Mr Hammond said as he arrived in the capital, Havana.  "But as Cuba enters a period of significant social and economic change, I am looking forward to demonstrating to the Cuban government and people that the UK is keen to forge new links across the Atlantic."  BBC Mexico and Central America correspondent Will Grant says increased trade is the main focus of the visit, with UK businesses looking to build links with Cuba's tourism, agriculture and financial services industries.  Cuba's largest trading partners are Venezuela and China. European Commission data shows Spain is the largest exporter to Cuba from the EU, with trade totalling nearly £750m last year.  UK exports were £25m in 2015, £19m in 2014 and £22m in 2013.  According to UK Trade & Investment, the top British products exported to Cuba came from the dairy, pharmaceutical, paper, drinks, optical, aluminium, and machinery sectors.  It says the UK remains under-represented in the market compared with other EU nations, although "significant trade" of products goes through third countries.  Last month Mr Obama became the first US president since 1928 to visit Cuba.  For years, the US and Cuba were engaged in a bitter stand-off, triggered by the overthrow of US-backed Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista by Communist leader Fidel Castro in 1959.  The US broke off diplomatic relations and imposed a trade embargo.	politics

And the people we will take out are all close to Corbyn."  That's what a Labour MP confided to me more than a week before Naz Shah's Facebook activities were exposed.  There is no suggestion that this particular MP was involved - and equally no suggestion that the shock felt by long standing Labour Party members at anti-Semitic comments by newer recruits is synthetic.  But for those opposed to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the week could hardly have gone better.  There is a consensus that anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is not widespread.  That contributed to Jeremy Corbyn's unfortunate "crisis? What crisis?," comments which suggested to some that he wasn't serious enough about tackling a small but highly toxic problem before it became a big and highly toxic problem.  At a recent meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party, concerns were expressed that the wrong impression was being given and that there had to be swifter and more pro-active action to root out anti-Semitism.  So Jeremy Corbyn's failure to suspend Naz Shah ahead of Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday - allowing David Cameron to berate him - allowed the Labour leader's critics to question the competence of his leadership as well as the substance of the issue.  But Ken Livingstone's remarks on Hitler and Zionism were a bonus.  Because this has already set off a chain reaction of challenges for the Labour leadership.  It has forced Jeremy Corbyn to use disciplinary procedures, which he dislikes.  He fought against the "witch hunt" and expulsion of ultra-Leftists in the 1980s, and as leader he wants to open Labour's doors to those to the left of the party to help build a more radical party and movement.  But now his critics are forcing him to at least lay the foundations of the walls to be built around Labour's broad church and to make clear some people, and some views, just aren't welcome.  This, in turn, is likely to make him look weak in the eyes of some of his supporters who joined Labour in order to vote for him as leader.  Then there is the question of what happens to Ken Livingstone - seen as a close supporter of the leader - after he has been investigated by party officials.  If he isn't expelled, Jeremy Corbyn again will be portrayed as soft on anti-Semitism - a charge which deeply offends him.  If Livingstone is expelled, not only will Jeremy Corbyn have lost an articulate high-profile ally, some on the left will be dismayed that the party leader hasn't been clear enough about the distinction between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, potentially opening up the possibility of a further purge of supporters.  That said, it was significant that Jon Lansman - a key figure in the pro-Corbyn Momentum movement -has not attempted to defend the former London mayor.  But then Tom Watson - the deputy leader with his own mandate - publicly fretted over the potential loss of seats in the forthcoming local elections in England because of the current adverse publicity.  Some Labour MPs are already planning to denounce a poor performance after these elections and they have just been handed more ammunition.  Pressure is also likely to mount on Jeremy Corbyn to distance himself not just from Ken Livingstone but from his own views.  When he met the President of the Board of Deputies of British Jews in February, Mr Corbyn said he would "reflect" on the request not to meet representatives of Hamas or Hezbollah as Labour leader.  His critics feel there now has been enough time for reflection and are calling for a decisive statement.  But what is most satisfying for his internal opponents is that they feel they have found a "wedge" issue to detach him from some of his support.  Many of his MPs don't like his views on a range of issues but to attack him for - for example - wanting to scrap nuclear weapons merely strengthens his support amongst newer, more left-wing members.  But while some of those members may have made offensive comments, many, many more despise anti-Semitism - so Jeremy Corbyn's reaction to those accused of it will be scrutinised closely by them.  The anti-Semitism row could yet become the "soft underbelly" of his leadership.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36169654	Q&A: Labour anti-Semitism row	It began on Tuesday when the Guido Fawkes political gossip site discovered Facebook posts made by Naz Shah, Labour's MP for Bradford West, in 2014, before she became an MP. She had shared a graphic showing Israel's outline on a map of the United States with the comment "problem solved". She was accused of anti-Semitism. She quit her role as an aide to shadow chancellor John McDonnell. She apologised to MPs on Wednesday, acknowledging "I have made a mistake". She added: "I accept and understand that the words I used caused upset and hurt to the Jewish community and I deeply regret that. Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relationships between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none." She was suspended from the party.  On Thursday, Ken Livingstone defended Naz Shah in a BBC interview, saying that she was not anti-Semitic.  He went on to say: "When Hitler won his election in 1932 his policy then was that Jews should be moved to Israel. He was supporting Zionism before he went mad and ended up killing six million Jews." This was roundly condemned and led to a televised confrontation with a furious John Mann, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's all-party group against anti-Semitism.  The former London mayor's explosive comments prompted a wave of criticism from Labour figures and calls for his suspension. Leader Jeremy Corbyn suspended him, saying: "There were grave concerns about the language he used. We had a discussion about it and decided we would suspend him and he would go through an investigation by the party." It is now up to the party's ruling National Executive Committee to decide whether he should be expelled.  Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner, after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name. He has divided opinion since his time as leader of the Greater London Council in the 1980s. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was Mr Livingstone who invented the "loony left". Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was "ahead of his time". Profile: Ken Livingstone  Mr Livingstone denied suggesting Hitler was a Zionist, adding the Nazi leader was "a monster from start to finish" and claimed to have been quoting historical "facts". But in an angry confrontation, Mr Mann shouted: "You're a Nazi apologist, you're rewriting history. Go back and check what Hitler did." Jonathan Arkush, president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews, said: "What Ken Livingstone deliberately did was to draw an equation between Nazism and Zionism. He therefore crossed a line into what certainly most people would regard as distinctly anti-Semitic." Livingstone Hitler comments 'inaccurate'  Anti-Semitism is "hostility and prejudice directed against Jewish people" according to the OED while Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, corresponding to the historic land of Israel. Some say the word "Zionist" can be used as a coded attack on Jews others, including Ken Livingstone, say anti-Zionism is not the same as anti-Semitism and criticism of Israeli government policy should not be conflated with anti-Jewish prejudice. What is the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism?  Labour's leaders say the party has a proud history of fighting racism and promoting racial equality - and the party's MPs would be horrified to belong to an organisation that was anti-Semitic. But it has faced accusations of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. In April, Luton councillor Aysegul Gurbuz was suspended from the party over a message on her Twitter account that Hitler was "the greatest man in history". The month before, it suspended activist Vicki Kirby for a second time following criticism of her reinstatement - posts on her Twitter page included one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God". Labour peer Baroness Royall is also looking into claims of anti-Semitism at Oxford University Labour club. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn says: "Anybody that thinks this party is not cracking down on anti-Semitism is simply wrong. We have suspended where appropriate, we've investigated all cases. We will not tolerate anti-Semitism in any form in our party.'	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36168487	EU referendum: Sir John Major in North Korea Brexit claim	Sir John Major has told those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU to "go to North Korea" if they want "undiluted sovereignty".  The former Conservative prime minister said "splendid isolation" would leave the UK weaker.  And he warned of economic damage if the UK votes to leave in the 23 June referendum.  Vote Leave said Sir John had been "wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years" and was wrong now.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir John said: "Day after day you have had the Brexit people producing soundbites that are either offensive or inaccurate or just plain silly.  "I don't believe that it is patriotic to argue for a case that is going to make this country weaker and is going to make the wellbeing of this country less certain in the future."  He went on: "To listen to them, you would think we are entrapped in the clutches of an evil empire, not in a democratic partnership with our European neighbours whose sunshine and pavement cafes we enjoy during holiday breaks."  The Leave campaign has said leaving the EU would restore sovereignty to the UK, freeing it from the influence of Brussels and the European Court of Justice, which oversees the application of EU-wide rules.  But Sir John said: "If you want undiluted sovereignty in the modern age, when everybody is interconnected, then go to North Korea because that is where you will get it.  "It is certainly true that we share sovereignty. We take some sovereignty from other people, we share some of ours.  "We haven't surrendered it because, at the end of the day, the House of Commons, our representatives, can say, 'We won't have this, we will leave the European Union.'  "But in the modern world, the modern world of interconnectivity, the modern world with the economy that now exists, you have to share sovereignty or you find yourself isolated and weaker."  Vote Leave chief executive Matthew Elliott said: "John Major complained about soundbites before descending in hyperbole about North Korea without even a hint of self-awareness.  "John Major has been wrong on nearly every EU issue over the last 20 years. He said Britain should join the ERM - that was a disaster which cost 3 million their jobs.  "He signed us up to Maastricht saying it wouldn't give up sovereignty and he refused to rule out joining the euro.  "Now he doesn't want to take back control and stop handing Brussels £350m a week. He was wrong then and he is wrong now."  It comes as UKIP leader Nigel Farage claimed he had been sidelined by Vote Leave, which is the officially designated campaign to get Britain out of the EU.  He said in a speech that Vote Leave was on the "back foot" because it had failed to focus on immigration - but it had rejected his offers of help.  "Every time I attempt to work with them I am rebuffed and rejected," he added.  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "We wish Nigel well."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168860	Hackers steal millions of Minecraft passwords	Hackers have stolen login data for more than seven million members of the Minecraft site Lifeboat.  Lifeboat lets members run servers for customised, multiplayer maps for the smartphone edition of Minecraft.  There is evidence that the stolen information, including email addresses and passwords, is being offered on sites that trade in hacked data.  Analysis suggests passwords were very weakly protected so attackers could easily work them out.  Information about the breach was passed to independent security expert Troy Hunt who said he got the list from someone who trades in stolen credentials. Several people had told him the data was circulating on dark net sites.  Mr Hunt said the data was stolen in early 2015 but the breach has only now come to light.  Passwords for Lifeboat accounts were hashed, he said, but the algorithm used provided little protection.  Hashing is a technique used to scramble passwords so they are not easily read if the data goes astray.  Often, he said, a Google search for a hashed password would instantly return the correct plain text value. Well-known cracking tools could automate and speed up this process, he said.  "A large portion of those passwords would be reverted to plain text in a very short time," he said in a blogpost about the breach.  This often lead to other security problems, he said, because many people re-use passwords so finding out one can lead attackers to compromise accounts on other sites.  In a statement given to Motherboard, Lifeboat said it had taken action to limit the damage.  "When this happened [in] early January we figured the best thing for our players was to quietly force a password reset without letting the hackers know they had limited time to act," it told the news site adding that it now used stronger hashing algorithms.  It said: "We have not received any reports of anyone being damaged by this."  Mr Hunt was critical of the company for "quietly" forcing the password re-set saying this policy left him "speechless".  Instead, he said, Lifeboat should have done much more to alert users so they could quickly change passwords if they used the same one on other sites.  "The first thing that should be on any company's mind after an incident like this is, 'How do we minimise the damage to our users?'" he said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36168857	Microsoft stops Google being used for Cortana searches	Microsoft is forcing people to use its Bing search engine with the Cortana digital assistant in Windows 10.  Every search done this way will also be piped only through its recently released Edge browser.  In a blogpost, Microsoft said it was making people use Bing so they could get the most out of other search-related features in its products.  Many Cortana users have previously preferred to carry out searches with Google rather than Bing.  Windows users will still be able to install other web browsers and use other search engines outside Cortana, said Ryan Gavin, Microsoft's head of search and Cortana, in the blogpost.  However, he said, Microsoft was adding extras to Edge and Bing that meant it made sense to tie these programs to Cortana instead of other search engines and browsers.  Anything else would be a "compromised experience that is less reliable and predictable", he said.  The extra features will differ depending on what people search for, but if someone used Cortana to look for a restaurant the browser would take them to the relevant webpage and add in a map to show the closest locations, Mr Gavin said.  On technical queries, these extras would return the usual list of potentially helpful pages but would return videos and other explainers, adding detail.  Mr Gavin said Microsoft was investing in these "end-to-end personal search experiences" and hoped they would prompt a series of actions after users carried out one search.  As an example of this, Mr Gavin said a future search for "tickets to a Rihanna show" would open up search results for seats tied to a user's preferences and complete every part of the buying process apart from the final click on the payment button.  Writing on the Search Engine Land news site, analyst Danny Sullivan said it was a mistake to limit "deliberate choices" users made.  "I think Microsoft is taking some big liberties here," he said.  Mr Sullivan went on to criticise the convoluted process Windows 10 users have to follow to change the default search engine used on Edge and Internet Explorer.  Although Microsoft has had some success getting people to use the Bing search engine, Google still dominates in this market.  Statistics gathered by Statcounter suggest that globally more than 90% of searches are carried out via Google. By contrast, Bing accounts for about 3% of searches.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36169019	US Supreme Court approves expanded hacking powers	The US Supreme Court has approved a rule change that would allow law enforcement to remotely search computers located anywhere in the US.  Previously, magistrate judges could order searches only within the jurisdiction of their court, often limited to a few counties.  The US Department of Justice (DoJ) said the change was necessary to modernise the law for the digital age.  But digital rights groups say the move expands the FBI's hacking authority.  The DoJ wants judges to be able to issue remote search warrants for computers located anywhere in the United States.  A remote search typically involves trying to access a suspect's computer over the internet to explore the data contained on it.  It has pushed for a change in the rules since 2013, arguing that criminals can mask their location and identity online making it difficult to determine which jurisdiction a computer is located in.  "Criminals now have ready access to sophisticated anonymising technologies to conceal their identity while they engage in crime over the internet," said DoJ spokesman Peter Carr.  "The use of remote searches is often the only mechanism available to law enforcement to identify and apprehend them.  "The amendment makes explicit that it does not change the traditional rules governing probable cause and notice."  It said the change would not give law enforcement any new authority not already permitted by law.  However, groups such as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) have warned that the change could expand the FBI's ability to conduct mass hacks on computer networks.  "Such a monumental change in the law should not be snuck by Congress under the guise of a procedural rule," said Neema Singh Guliani of the ACLU.  In 2015, search giant Google also opposed the change, which, it said, "threatens to undermine the privacy rights and computer security of internet users".  Oregon Senator Ron Wyden said the change had "significant consequences for Americans' privacy", and said he would seek to reverse the decision.  "Under the proposed rules, the government would now be able to obtain a single warrant to access and search thousands or millions of computers at once; and the vast majority of the affected computers would belong to the victims, not the perpetrators, of a cybercrime," he said in a statement.  Congress can still opt to reject or modify the changes to the federal rules of criminal procedure - but if it does not act by 1 December the change will take effect.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36164115	Elections watchdog urges more time in Conservatives expenses probe	Police and prosecutors should ask for more time to decide whether to bring prosecutions over the Conservatives' 2015 election returns, says a watchdog.  The Electoral Commission said it "does not mean that it has any view" on whether charges should be brought.  It has invited several police forces to a meeting next week on the issue.  The Conservatives have admitted failing to declare £38,000 of general election expenses for accommodation costs, blaming an "administrative error".  They said they failed to register what was paid to put up Tory activists involved in the party's Battlebus operation - following a Channel 4 investigation.  The party said the tour was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  It says it was "some millions below" the spending threshold for the national campaign and would have had no reason not to declare it.  But Channel 4 said its investigation suggested the operation was focused at a local level, so should have been declared as such.  The deadline for any prosecutions is 12 months from the date of any offence, unless police or the director of public prosecutions apply to the courts for an extension.  The Electoral Commission is investigating whether the Conservatives met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act for the 2015 general election and by-elections in Newark, Clacton and Rochester and Strood.  It has the power to fine parties over their national campaign spending - but it is up to the police to investigate or sanction local party candidates over local campaign spending under the Representation of the People Act.  The commission said its view was that "in the absence of any current investigation by the police, it would be sensible for the criminal justice agencies to retain the ability to take action, should appropriate evidence come to light as part of the commission's own investigation".  The Electoral Commission said it does not believe it will finish its investigation before the deadline for any potential offences under the Representation of the People Act expires.	politics

In 2014, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) sued Amazon over its handling of in-app purchases on its app store for Kindle and Android devices.  The FTC reached out-of-court settlements with Apple and Google over their app stores in the same year.  The trading watchdog said it would urge the court to demand full refunds for affected Amazon customers.  Many mobile games and programs offer in-app purchases, which let people spend real money on extras in games, music downloads or to unlock premium features.  Amazon, Apple and Google were all criticised when the concept was first launched, after a number of parents complained that their children had run up huge bills while playing games.  The FTC sued the three companies in 2014, with Apple agreeing to refund customers more than $30m (£20m) and Google about $19m (£13m).  Amazon first introduced in-app purchases in its app store in November 2011. According to the FTC's lawsuit the default setting "did not require account holder approval, by entry of a password or any other means, prior to completion of an in-app purchase".  The FTC also criticised the presentation of information in the app store, which it said was not clear.  The watchdog's data analyst Julie Miller suggested that Amazon had made $86m (£59m) from the in-app purchases, 42% of which were unauthorised.  But US District Judge John Coughenour questioned the accuracy of the figures, while Amazon said the estimates were "fundamentally flawed".  However, the judge sided with the FTC and said: "The millions of dollars billed to Amazon customers without a mechanism for consent, the thousands of customers complaining about unauthorised charges and the time spent seeking refunds for those charges, all demonstrate substantial injury.  "It is Amazon's stated policy that in-app purchases are final and non-refundable, likely discouraging much of its customer base from attempting to seek refunds."  The judge asked both parties for more information about how much money Amazon might owe consumers and has yet to decide damages.  Since 2014, Amazon has changed how in-app purchases are described in its app store and refined its authorisation experience. In-app purchases can be disabled completely with the company's parental control options.  Amazon did not reply to the BBC's request for comment.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17539320	Ken Livingstone: Profile of former London Mayor	Ken Livingstone, who has been suspended by the Labour Party over comments he made while defending an MP at the centre of an anti-Semitism row, has a had long and often controversial political career.  Twice elected Mayor of London, once under his own independent banner, after falling out with Tony Blair, he is one of the few figures in British politics to be routinely referred to by his first name. Another being his nemesis, and Conservative successor as mayor, Boris Johnson.  Like Mr Johnson, he cultivated a quirky public image, with his pet newts and appearances on chat shows. He even lent his nasal tones to a track on a best-selling Blur album.  His way with a provocative soundbite was the making of him, propelling him to national prominence from the grey world of local government, but it has also got him into a lot of hot water over the years. Not for nothing is his autobiography called You Can't Say That.  He was suspended from office as mayor for four weeks in 2006 for comparing a Jewish journalist to a concentration camp guard - a comment he continues to be unrepentant about, saying it was a "fuss about nothing". The suspension was overturned in court.  He has also been repeatedly criticised for his decision to welcome controversial Muslim cleric Yusuf Al-Qaradawi, who condoned suicide bombings, to London in 2005. He said it was part of an effort to improve relations with the Muslim world.  He remains popular in left wing circles as one of the few genuine socialists to have achieved real power in the UK - but he had largely disappeared from the political scene, following his defeat in 2012 mayoral contest, although he continued to be elected to Labour's ruling National Executive Committee.  He was enjoying semi-retirement when his old friend and ally Jeremy Corbyn was unexpectedly elected Labour leader last year.  The two go back a long way - they share the same political outlook and commitment to causes such as nuclear disarmament and Palestinian solidarity - and Mr Corbyn worked hard to get him to the top at the Greater London Council in the early 1980s.  Marital status: Married his long- term partner in 2009. Two children with current partner and three other children.  Time served as Mayor: Two terms from 2000-2008  Mr Corbyn drafted in advisers from Mr Livingstone's time in City Hall when he took on Labour's top job and Mr Livingstone himself became part of his inner circle.  Before long, the former London mayor was back on the airwaves as Mr Corbyn's chief defender, in the face of attacks from Blairite opponents.  He was also given a role on the party's defence review - but controversy, almost inevitably, followed.  He faced a barrage of criticism from Labour MPs - including Mr Corbyn himself - for suggesting Kevan Jones, a shadow defence minister who had suffered from depression, needed "psychiatric help" for suggesting he knew nothing about defence.  An apology eventually came but Mr Livingstone was soon in trouble again, over comments on BBC One's Question Time about how the 7/7 London bombers "gave their lives" to protest against the Iraq war.  He then came under fire from Labour colleagues for describing a donation to Labour MP Dan Jarvis from a hedge fund as like "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group".  It later emerged Mr Livingstone himself had accepted £8,000 from a hedge fund, leading to accusations of hypocrisy.  Born in Streatham, South London in 1945, Kenneth Robert Livingstone attended Tulse Hill Comprehensive before taking up a job as a lab technician working on cancer research in the Royal Marsden Hospital.  In 1971 he was elected to Lambeth Borough Council and that was the start of a long career in politics. Over the next 10 years he served as a local councillor and then on Greater London council before becoming the leader of the GLC in 1981.  After the GLC was abolished he crossed the River Thames to Westminster, winning the seat of Brent East in 1987.  He had a child at the age of 57 with his long term partner and later wife Emma Beal. At the time it was thought to be his first child but in 2008 it emerged that he already had three other children with another two women. Beal and Livingstone went on to have a second child in 2004.  He always had a difficult relationship with his own party. Frequently critical of Neil Kinnock, his battle with the party leadership did not diminish under Tony Blair.  In the run-up to the election of 2000 he failed to secure the Labour mayoral candidacy, losing out to the leadership favourite, Frank Dobson.  Mr Livingstone declared that he would stand as an independent candidate, and so Labour expelled him from the party.  Standing as an independent far from scuppered him, and he won with 58% of the vote.  In 2000, Tony Blair had been critical of his prospects in office claiming he would be a "disaster". However Mr Blair had to eat his words when Livingstone was admitted back into the party ahead of the 2004 mayoral election which saw him re-elected.  "I think I should be big enough to say the prediction I made has not turned out right," Mr Blair said at the time.  Mr Livingstone's flagship mayoral policy was the introduction of the controversial congestion charge in central London, later extended to west London. He unsuccessfully fought the Labour government as it introduced a public-private partnership plan for the London Underground.  He was also involved with London's successful bid for the Olympic Games and in dealing with the aftermath of the terrorist attack of 2005. Even his opponent Boris Johnson praised him for speaking up for London after 7/7 and the failed attack several weeks later.  Mr Livingstone boasts achievements such as the introduction of the Oyster card for London transport, free use of public transport for under-18s in full-time education and a revival and increased usage of London buses. He also claims to have increased numbers of police on London's streets to a record level.  He faced attack for his links with the Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, signing an oil deal with him in 2007 and when he lost the mayoral election in 2008 taking up a position as a consultant to Chavez, advising on urban planning.  Ken Livingstone has always divided opinion. Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock alleges that it was the former GLC boss who invented the "loony left" and who brought about the council's abolition by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  Others were shocked by his call for dialogue with the IRA and championing of gay and ethnic minority rights - issues on which he now says he was "ahead of his time".  The Sun newspaper once described him as "the most odious man in Britain".  But he is still popular with many on the left of the Labour Party, who relished his role as a thorn in Lady Thatcher's side and for speaking his mind about his socialist beliefs, when all about him in the party were abandoning theirs.  It is perhaps, ironic, that just as the Labour Party has started to come back to his way of thinking, he faces being excluded from it.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36159146	Man jailed for failing to decrypt hard drives	A man has been held in prison for seven months after failing to decrypt two hard drives that investigators suspect contain indecent images of children.  A court order says the man will remain jailed "until such time that he fully complies" with an order to unlock the password-protected devices.  The US man, who has not been charged with possessing illegal images, is appealing against his detention.  "He has never in his life been charged with a crime," wrote his lawyer.  The case highlights the US government's ongoing battle with data encryption.  The man, a former police sergeant, cannot be named for legal reasons.  In March 2015, investigators in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, seized computer equipment from the man's home, including two password-protected hard drives.  The investigators had been monitoring the online network Freenet and decided to search the man's home, according to news site Ars Technica.  After a district court ruled the man would not be compelled to decrypt the hard drives, investigators took the case to a federal court that issued a warrant to search the devices.  The government then invoked a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, which gives federal courts the power to force people to co-operate in a criminal investigation.  The same law was controversially invoked by the FBI when it tried to compel Apple to decrypt the iPhone used by California gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. Apple said that the demand was a "stretch" of the law.  According to the jailed man's appeal, he appeared at the district attorney's office to enter passcodes for the hard drives - but they failed to work.  He was then ordered to explain his failure to enter the correct passcodes, but after declining to testify was held in contempt of court and jailed.  "His confinement stems from an assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination," wrote the man's lawyer, Keith Donoghue.  The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment is designed to protect people from being forced to testify and potentially incriminating themselves and states: "No person shall be... compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which campaigns for digital rights, said: "Compelled decryption is inherently testimonial because it compels a suspect to use the contents of their mind to translate unintelligible evidence into a form that can be used against them."  The man's appeal also contends that he should not be forced to decrypt the hard drives because the investigators do not know for certain whether indecent images are stored on them.  The EFF agreed: "Complying with the order would communicate facts that are not foregone conclusions already known to the government".  The appeal, which argued the man should be released from prison while it was considered, was filed on 26 April.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36158606	German nuclear plant hit by computer viruses	Computer viruses have infected PCs used at a German nuclear power plant.  The viruses were found on office computers and in a system used to model the movement of nuclear fuel rods.  Power firm RWE said the infection posed no threat to the plant because its control systems were not linked to the internet, so the viruses could not activate.  German federal cyber investigators are now analysing how the Gundremmingen plant became infected.  The viruses were found on the fuel rod modelling system and on 18 USB sticks used as removable data stores on office computers.  Staff found the viruses as they prepared to upgrade the computerised control systems for the plant's Block B, which is currently not producing power while it undergoes scheduled maintenance.  More than 1,000 computers have now been checked for infection and cleaned up, an RWE spokesman told newspaper Die Zeit. The plant has also improved its security controls.  No system directly involved with the control of the nuclear reactors was infected, RWE said, and there was no danger to the public as a result of the infection.  "All sensitive plant areas are decoupled and designed with redundancy and protected against manipulation," added RWE in a statement.  Among the viruses were two well-known malicious programs - W32.Ramnit and Conficker.  Ramnit debuted in 2010 and is a remote access tool that its creators use to steal data. Conficker dates from 2008 and aims to grab login names and financial data.  Because the infected systems were isolated from the net, neither Ramnit nor Conficker were able to activate, update and steal data, said RWE.  Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said power plants and other chunks of a nation's critical infrastructure were often infected by viruses but such compromises did little damage.  "The most common viruses spread without much awareness of where they are," he told Reuters.  Gundremmingen is about 120km (75m) northwest of Munich and the plant is Gemany's highest output power station.	tech

Hull, with an average of 12.4Mbps, is the UK's slowest city, according to comparison site uSwitch, which conducted the tests.  London and Edinburgh had average speeds of 22.4Mbps and 21Mbps respectively.  These speeds are likely to be low not because of lack of availability but because people have chosen not to take up faster services.  Government figures suggest superfast broadband - 24Mbps or higher - is now available to more than 90% of homes and businesses, with funding pledged to bring that total to 95% by 2017.  According to BT, its fibre services are available to 24 million home, but only 22% (5.5 million) have connected to them.  Hull is the only UK city not served by BT's Openreach, which controls the telecoms network. Hull's independent supplier, KCOM, disputed the findings.  "We're rolling out ultrafast fibre to the home across Hull and East Yorkshire, which means speeds of 250Mbps are available to consumers right now," said a KCOM spokesman.  The company says it is connecting "a new customer to fibre every 30 minutes".  But uSwitch's Ewan Taylor-Gibson said: "Actual speed tests taken by broadband users would suggest this hasn't reached enough homes yet to make an impact on the average."  Three in 10 tests logged speeds of less than 5Mbps with just one in 10 registering speeds of above 50Mbps, according to the data.  "We should be asking what more can be done to encourage the adoption of superfast broadband now it's so widely available," he said.  "The UK's towns and cities should be leading the charge when it comes to broadband speeds, yet just 22 cities have broadband users with average speeds of more than 24Mbps."  Co-founder of broadband news site Thinkbroadband Sebastien Lahtinen said: "Broadband speed tests are a great way to measure real world speeds experienced by users - but they also serve as a measure of take-up, not just availability."  "Whilst early adopters and digital natives are often craving for faster and faster services, not everyone wants to stream multiple HD streams live whilst playing online games.  Those who just use the Internet for the occasional catch-up TV programme, email and Facebook, broadband speed is not really a priority, especially when the fastest services can cost considerably more."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36153391	University challenge: Hackers compete for top prize	Computer hackers are constantly exploiting security flaws and accessing private information. For the participants at a new annual competition, though, it's not a crime - it's a sport.  Blood-curdling cries were punctuated by the sound of bamboo swords thwacking against armour, as Cambridge University's Kendo team practiced for their annual match against arch rivals Oxford.  The samurai-inspired martial art requires skill in both attack and defence, and according to the team instructor Dr Frank Stajano, cyber-security is no different.  "You cannot pretend that you will only be able to do the defence side because if you are not skilled at the attack you will not be able to defend."  Dr Stajano, who is reader in security and privacy at the Computer Laboratory, Cambridge University, is also the organiser of the Inter-ACE Cyberchallenge. It's a tournament of hacking fought this year between 10 of the UK's 13 Academic Centres of Excellence in Cyber Security Research.  "It's a 'sportified' version of a hacking competition" he told BBC Radio 4's PM programme, "where the challengers have to perform the same type of attacks that the bad guys do on enterprise computers."  To win, teams had to complete tasks that required them to hone the skills hackers might use to attack systems.  The so-called "capture the flag" challenges, which were designed by engineers from Facebook, required students to uncover secret lines of code or "flags", using their hacking skills.  In a more combative challenge, teams fought to take control of a server, with other teams battling to kick them out.  The day began with pizza and pop, not yet banned artificial stimulants, and a warning to competitors not to launch denial of service attacks against computer lab systems.  As the teams of four students began hacking the noise level fell, concentration levels rose, and streams of computer code started marching up laptop screens.  As a spectator sport hacking presents serious challenges for commentators,  "I'm doing some reverse engineering things," one competitor from the University of Southampton hesitantly explained - perhaps aware that a journalist whose computing career peaked in a failed effort to write machine code on a ZX81 might struggle to grasp the finer points of contemporary hacking.  "We're just trying to break into different web applications, and different systems," a member of Queens University Belfast told me, as though that was all rather routine.  "The real interesting parts have been steganography," another student from the University of Kent team observed, referencing the technique of hiding data in sound and images.  "If it was a sport it would be a participant sport," he argued, but as preparation for dealing with life outside the ivory tower it was first rate. "Being able to deal with security vulnerabilities will hold us in good stead," he said.  The battle here was fought purely for honour, but in the real world the stakes are much higher. It's a game even nation states play. Birmingham's captain researches car vehicle security - "and the stakes are human lives," she said.  But the students weren't the only ones gaining knowledge. Spectating was Sergeant Phil Cobley of the local Cyber Crime Unit. Rather than advising competitors to "mind how you go", Sergeant Cobley was treating it as learning experience. His work is with Cyber Prevent, the police programme that tries to steer young people away from cyber-crime.  The Prevent programme has been criticised for urging parents to look out for behaviours and interests that, critics say, could be perfectly innocent - and resemble those of budding web entrepreneurs and white-hat hackers. "I think the important thing is around educational awareness," he said, making it clear that there were benefits to "community, society and themselves" if young people develop computer skills and use them in the right way.  Dr Stajano hopes that by practising the skills criminal black-hat hackers use, the students will become effective cyber-defenders. If you don't teach these techniques, he said, "the only ones who will be skilled in them will be the ones who are already bent on evil".  University sport has long been an opportunity to forge relationships later in life, and that was also in Dr Stajano's mind when he started the contest.  "In 10 or 20 years time when each of them is the head of security for a company or head of homeland security for their country then they will remember when they were little they were here one day in Cambridge in 2016 and they have pals over there they can exchange notes with and fight against the bad guys."  The competition will be run annually, but in this first clash the laurels, or rather a large shiny cup, went to home team Cambridge, with Imperial and Southampton taking silver and bronze respectively.  Clutching the trophy, a member of the Cambridge team seemed relieved. "The other Universities like Southampton and Imperial were on our tails throughout the entire competition," he said.	tech

Lord Levy told BBC Newsnight he believed anti-Semitism existed across the political divide, but it seemed "more prominent" within Labour.  It follows the party's decision to suspend MP Naz Shah from the party over comments about Israel on social media, pending an investigation.  Ms Shah has made a "profound apology" in the Commons for her remarks.  The MP for Bradford West has been widely criticised for Facebook posts she made before she became an MP, in which she suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States.  Lord Levy, who was Tony Blair's envoy and chief fundraiser, told the BBC her comments displayed "ignorance", and he was left "scratching his head with despair as to how people like this can enter our parliament with such a lack of knowledge, discretion and sensitivity".  His comments were echoed by cross-bench peer Baroness Neuberger, who claimed Labour's problem of anti-Semitism was "attached to Jeremy Corbyn becoming leader", and added that it was "an issue with the hard left".  Labour has faced claims of growing anti-Semitism in its ranks. Earlier this year a Labour Luton councillor was suspended from the party after claiming Hitler was the "greatest man in history".  Jeremy Corbyn has insisted anti-Semitism will not be tolerated but some of his MPs say the party leadership is not doing enough to stamp it out.  Shadow education secretary Lucy Powell, Ed Miliband's former chief of staff, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the party "had to do more" to tackle anti-Semitism and MP Lisa Nandy said it had to be more "pro-active".  But Ken Livingstone - the former London Mayor who is a close ally of Mr Corbyn - said Ms Shah's remarks were not anti-Semitic and the suspension was unnecessary.  He told LBC Radio: "What we have at the moment is a lot of people making a big issue about anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. In 47 years I have never heard anyone say anything anti-Semitic.  "We expelled a couple of people from the Labour Party early on for saying things that could clearly be interpreted as anti-Semitic.  "This is not that; this is an over-the-top comment about the horrendous conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians."  Lord Levy told BBC London Mr Livingstone was "living on another planet" and "well past his sell-by date" if he believed Ms Shah's comments were not anti-Semitic.  Ms Shah was also defended by George Galloway, the former Respect MP who she defeated at the general election, who said in an article that her comments were "half-witted" but not anti-Semitic, and claims to the contrary were "just another stick to beat Corbyn out of office with".  The former Labour MP said Mr Corbyn and his closest ally shadow chancellor John McDonnell were "lifelong campaigners for Palestinians" but he claimed there was an "establishment" conspiracy to falsely paint them as anti-Semitic.  Initially, Mr Corbyn warned Ms Shah about what he described as her "offensive and unacceptable" posts - but he came under pressure to go further by David Cameron, at Prime Minister's Questions.  Ms Shah, who has quit on Tuesday as an aide to Mr McDonnell, then told the Commons: "Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relations between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none."  Labour later issued a statement saying Mr Corbyn and Ms Shah had agreed that she was "administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary", pending an investigation.  "She is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed," the statement added.  In a 2014 Facebook post Ms Shah shared a graphic showing an image of Israel's outline superimposed on a map of the US under the headline "Solution for Israel-Palestine conflict - relocate Israel into United States", with the comment "problem solved".  The post suggested the US has "plenty of land" to accommodate Israel as a 51st state, allowing Palestinians to "get their life and their land back".  It added that Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the "transportation cost" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending.  The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes political blogging website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Adolf Hitler.  Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway.  Her selection as a candidate proved controversial, with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee.  A bitter campaign followed, with Mr Galloway sparking anger by questioning Ms Shah's account of her forced marriage.  After her victory, she was celebrated locally and nationally for her unique background and life experiences.  Growing up in poverty in Bradford, Ms Shah and her family were abandoned by her father who eloped with a neighbour's teenage daughter. She has spoken openly about her experience of surviving a forced marriage and domestic violence.	politics

The Bank of Japan kept interest rates unchanged despite coming under pressure to take further action.  It had introduced negative rates in January but this failed to provide a much needed boost for the economy.  The Nikkei 225 finished 3.6% lower at 16,666.05. New economic data also showed a slip back into deflation while industrial production expanded.  Japan has for years been trying to boost its economy and end a period of stifling deflation.  One way to try to achieve this is by monetary policy, which is one of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's three key "Abenomics" policies to turn around the economy.  But even negative rates - meaning commercial banks will be charged if they deposit money with the central bank - have not trickled down to get banks to lend more and companies and people to invest or spend more.  Inflation is still far off the 2% target.  The Bank of Japan's decision to hold rates also sent the yen currency soaring, which is likely to have a negative affect on the crucial export sector.  The yen rose nearly 2% against the dollar, with one dollar worth 109.33 yen.  "This shows that too much expectation of further easing had been priced in and the BOJ has surprised the market by taking no action," said market analyst Margaret Yang of CMC Markets.  "It is probable that the central bank is temporarily running out of tools to stimulate the economy, or they need more time to observe and assess the impact of negative interest rates."  The three arrows of "Abenomics":  Markets elsewhere in Asia were also affected by the surprise from Tokyo.  In China, the mainland's Shanghai Composite index closed down 0.3% at 2,946.20, while in Hong Kong the Hang Seng edged up 0.1% to 21,388.03.  In South Korea, the benchmark Kospi index lost 0.7% to close at 2,000.93.  Earlier on Thursday, Korean tech giant Samsung reported a 10.6% rise in net profit for the first quarter, driven by strong sales of its Galaxy S7 smartphones. The results matched the company's guidance that was issued two weeks ago.  Samsung's shares closed down 2.7%, reversing three days of gains.  In Australia, Sydney's ASX/200 index closed up 0.7% at 5,225.40.	tech

The Bradford West MP has been heavily criticised over the Facebook posts, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States.  In a Commons statement she offered a "profound apology" for the posts, which were made before she became an MP.  Earlier party leader Jeremy Corbyn warned her about the "offensive and unacceptable" posts and David Cameron called for her suspension.  Labour said: "Jeremy Corbyn and Naz Shah have mutually agreed that she is administratively suspended from the Labour Party by the general secretary.  "Pending investigation, she is unable to take part in any party activity and the whip is removed."  Apologising in the Commons, Ms Shah, who had already quit as an unpaid aide to shadow chancellor John McDonnell, said: "Anti-Semitism is racism, full stop. As an MP I will do everything in my power to build relationships between Muslims, Jews and people of different faiths and none."  The announcement of her suspension came after pressure mounted on the MP, with Mr Cameron saying during Prime Minister's Questions it was "quite extraordinary" that Labour had not withdrawn the whip from her over what he suggested were "racist" comments.  Saying sorry three times didn't prevent Naz Shah's suspension.  Number 10 are taking credit - but one shadow cabinet member, Lisa Nandy, had already called for her suspension and I'm told other Labour figures had approached party officials privately to call for the same thing.  Ten days ago Labour's general secretary had reassured MPs those accused of anti-Semitism would be expelled or suspended.  Insiders say that once the Labour leader had decided to hand the matter to party officials, suspension - and an investigation - became inevitable.  Most Labour MPs recognise few members hold anti-Semitic views but that some high-profile cases have been toxic, and have been pressing their leadership to be more proactive in uncovering and rooting out unacceptable views.  And some on the party's right are keen to force a leader who has opposed "witch hunts" of party members to use disciplinary procedures to erect, however reluctantly, some walls to Labour's broad church - and to make clear that the views of some recent members and supporters aren't welcome.  Minutes before PMQs, Mr Corbyn issued a statement, saying: "These are historic social media posts made before she was a member of parliament. Naz has issued a fulsome apology.  "She does not hold these views and accepts she was completely wrong to have made these posts. The Labour Party is implacably opposed to anti-Semitism and all forms of racism."  Labour MP Lisa Nandy had called for Ms Shah's suspension, while another Labour MP, Kate Hoey, told BBC Radio 4's The World at One she should resign "right away" from the Commons Home Affairs Committee, which is carrying out an inquiry into anti-Semitism.  Naz Shah burst onto the political scene during the 2015 general election, where she ousted Respect MP George Galloway.  Her selection as a candidate proved controversial with divisions emerging in the local party. The candidate who was chosen first stood down four days later, before Ms Shah was imposed by the ruling National Executive Committee.

It added Israeli people would be welcome and safe in the US, while the "transportation cost" would be less than three years' worth of Washington's support for Israeli defence spending.  Ms Shah added a note suggesting the plan might "save them some pocket money".  The post was brought to light by the Guido Fawkes website, which also highlighted a post in which she appeared to liken Israeli policies to those of Hitler.  In a statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.  "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."  She set out a more detailed apology in an article for Jewish News.  "The language I used was wrong," she wrote.  "It is hurtful. What's important is the impact these posts have had on other people. I understand that referring to Israel and Hitler as I did is deeply offensive to Jewish people for which I apologise."  The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	politics

Mark Pritchard, who also wants rubber linings on car doors to allow them to be closed quietly, says rising noise levels are hitting quality of life.  He also saw no need for emergency services' sirens after midnight.  "The right to respite from constant noise needs to be a feature of government policy," he told MPs.  During a parliamentary debate, which the Conservative MP for Wrekin said was a first in Commons history, Mr Pritchard said there had been a lot of discussion about making cities greener and smarter, but little thought given to making them quieter.  He noted there were no cities in his Shropshire constituency, or in the entire county, and that Ludlow had designated itself a "slow town".  He cited research suggesting unremitting noise pollution helped cause sleep deprivation and high blood pressure and, in extreme cases, was a contributory factor in hearing loss and cardiovascular disease.  "Loud cities do have an impact on the quality of life of millions of people," he said. "They also have an impact on our health."  Among the mitigating measures that should be encouraged, he said, were tree planting, the use of "noise buffers" in landscaping, more car-free areas, quieter pavements and road surfaces, the proper fitting of manhole covers and "polite notices" about loud conversations and mobile ring tones on public transport.  Rubber lining should become mandatory in car doors in the future as "metal on metal makes noise".  On emergency services, he said: "Some of the sirens are so ear-piercing. The ambulances do seem to be, anecdotally, far louder than the police. Do they need to be used after midnight when the blue lights can be seen?"  He also hit out at the London Duck tours which he said were causing "real disruption" to the lives of residents  He said: "The right to respite from constant noise needs to be a feature of government policy, part of its strategy, not a by-product of another government policy.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36149481	What should Apple do next?	Apple reported its first fall in sales in 13 years on Tuesday. Sales were down around $8bn (£5.5bn) compared with this time last year and its shares have fallen nearly 20% in the last 12 months.  While it's fair to say the firm is still a long way from the breadline - it has around $200bn in offshore reserves alone - many see the news as a sign that the winning formula it has upheld for so long is no longer enough.  So where next for the billion dollar business? The BBC asked the experts.  Ben Wood from CCS Insight specialises in scrutinising the tech industry.  Virtual reality, which chief executive Tim Cook has already declared an area of great potential, and the much-rumoured Apple car could both prove extremely lucrative for the tech giant, he believes.  He also thinks Apple could set its sights on the potentially lucrative Indian market.  "Although it is a tough challenge for Apple to sell full price iPhones in India, the sheer scale of the population and potential for smartphone adoption cannot be ignored," he said.  Failing that, Apple could take on the likes of Amazon and Sky as a major content provider, Mr Wood argued.  "Apple has a huge cash pile that would allow it to easily purchase the rights to major sporting events or other hot content areas," he said.  "Given its ability to distribute content to the huge installed base of affluent Apple device owners, this could be a new direction for the company."  Chief Policy Adviser Martin Baxter from the Institute of Environmental Management & Assessment also believes cars are a smart move for the firm, but not necessarily the autonomous type.  "With air quality concerns in the news, clearly electric vehicles have the potential to reduce harmful emissions - if we have renewable energy to generate the electricity," he said.  "Apple has a big role to play in both the vehicle, and energy harvesting, making the process more efficient. It would be a completely new market for them and would also address those challenges."  Liam, Apple's iPhone recycling robot, is all very well, but Mr Baxter wants to see the firm go further.  "They could do more on repairability," he said.  "It's great that they can recover material but what we want is more product durability."  That might not help boost sales however.  Cam Bunton, editor of 9to5Mac, believes Apple needs to come out with its next landscape-changing product.  "As a tech enthusiast Apple is pretty boring," says Mr Bunton.  "They release stuff once or twice a year, it's usually similar to what they've done already. It's a good strategy and makes them lots of money though," he says.  "That said, I think the iPhone SE is an important device for those who maybe want all the performance and spec of an iPhone but haven't been able to afford one."  Mr Bunton also called for more openness from the notoriously secretive company - but conceded that perhaps that's part of its appeal.  "I would like them to share more - stop pretending developing tech is a massive secret that nobody else is doing.  "But I guess that's what has made them successful - the secrecy builds up excitement so when they release something it sounds brand new," he said.  Graham Seddon, partner and technology sector specialist at accountancy firm Menzies, also thinks the iPhone is entering its twilight years.  "Even the greatest product, from the greatest brand, has a lifecycle that will end," he said.  "The macroeconomic factors of a strong US dollar and slowing growth in China have had an impact, alongside the ongoing competition in the smartphone market as other manufacturers have played catch-up.  "For the moment, Apple's Tim Cook seems to be adamant that the dip in performance is merely a 'pause' in growth and he seems to be in denial that global demand for iPhones could at last be waning.  "We will have to wait and see if products like the Apple Watch, iPad or even the 'Apple Car' can help to drive up revenues once again."  "Take the base that you've got and keep innovating," says Professor Les Carr from the University of Southampton.  "I don't join in the clamour for Apple having to deliver another landmark product such as iPhone.  "What Apple do is bring out technology that provides a certain level of innovation then incrementally improve it. I think they aren't one for releasing a million products onto the market and seeing which one flies."  Prof Carr thinks there is yet more potential in the Apple Watch, and also believes its foray into health and wellbeing with its Apple Health tracking service will prove successful.  "Personal health is going to be a huge market and Apple has the product to leverage that."	tech

Codenamed NX, the console had been expected to launch in time for Christmas.  Analysts agree the new device is much needed after disappointing sales for the Wii U.  At an earnings briefing, Nintendo also announced it would release four more smartphone games this business year, as it diversified its business.  The Japanese video-game maker reported a 24 billion yen ($216m, £147m) loss for January to March, bigger than the loss it reported the previous year.  Research company IHS's director of games, Pier Harding-Rolls, said the date of the new console launch was a setback for Nintendo.  "Ideally, they would have preferred to launch in 2016 to catch the holiday shopping season," he told the BBC.  The delay could either be as a result of in-house games not being ready or problems with the hardware, he added.  Nintendo has had ups and downs with its consoles - with the Wii proving a hit but the Wii U failing to engage the public.  "When the Wii U launched no-one really understood what it was," said Mr Harding-Rolls.  "The two-screen experience wasn't communicated well, so whatever they are bringing to market this time has to be unique and communicated clearly."  The company said it could cease production of the Wii U by March 2018.  Sales of the Wii U console have lagged behind those of Sony's PlayStation 4 and Microsoft's Xbox, while sales of Nintendo's handheld 3DS console have also flattened as users turn to mobiles and tablets as alternatives.  Nintendo forecast Wii U sales at 800,000 this business year, from 3.26 million the previous year.  It said it would release Pokemon Sun and Pokemon Moon for the 3DS in time for Christmas.  Nintendo also announced it was working on smartphone apps based on two of its most popular titles - Animal Crossing and Fire Emblem, both of which will be released in the autumn.  Fire Emblem is a tactical role-playing game that gives users control of a small anime army, while Animal Crossing is based on living in a village, performing tasks and furnishing a home.  Nintendo's first mobile game - Miitomo - has already accrued 10 million users since its March launch, according to Nintendo.  The game allows players to create customisable avatars called Miis, which they can dress and photograph.  More information about the NX is expected to be announced during the E3 games conference in June.	tech

Blizzard Entertainment no longer operates servers for the original WoW so some gamers have set up their own.  The company said giving its blessing to pirate servers would damage its legal rights, but was considering adding a stripped-back realm to appease fans.  One former WoW developer called for the original game to be "preserved".  World of Warcraft is an online multi-player game in which players explore a vast landscape, complete quests and interact with other gamers.  At its peak in 2010, World of Warcraft attracted almost 12 million subscribers, but the game today attracts about five million paying customers.  The original game from 2004 has since been updated with new instalments that some players say have materially changed the experience of the game.  Some fans have set up their own servers to play the original, "vanilla" WoW although the practice is technically illegal.  On 10 April, a popular fan server known as Nostalrius, with 150,000 active members, was closed after the threat of legal action by Blizzard Entertainment. It sparked a petition which has attracted 240,000 signatures.  "The honest answer is, failure to protect against intellectual property infringement would damage Blizzard's rights," Blizzard wrote in a forum post.  "There is not a clear legal path to protect Blizzard's intellectual property and grant an operating licence to a pirate server."  Due to the nature of intellectual property law, turning a blind eye to pirate servers would make it difficult for Blizzard to challenge other abuses of its franchise in the future.  The firm added that it could not operate its own server for the original game "without great difficulty", but said it was considering whether opening a "pristine realm" within the latest game would appease fans.  A pristine realm would simulate the gameplay of the original WoW within the latest edition of the game.  "In essence that would turn off all levelling acceleration including character transfers, heirloom gear, character boosts, Recruit-A-Friend bonuses..." the company wrote.  "We aren't sure whether this version of a clean slate is something that would appeal to the community and it's still an open topic of discussion."  The suggestion received a mixed reaction from fans on WoW message boards.  "I would love the idea of a pristine server updated to current WoW that you could build a community around without being stuck in the old game," said one player.  But another added: "When you actually start listing all the improvements to the game since vanilla, you see why it should stay dead... the sheer amount of people clouded by nostalgia is staggering."  The closure of fan-run servers such as Nostalrius has highlighted the difficulty in preserving modern video games for historical record.  On Tuesday, game developer Mark Kern who worked on the original WoW, said: "WoW is an important game, it's part of gaming history, but there's no legal way for people to enjoy its earlier versions or see where it all came from.  "Unlike the old days, they can't just boot up a floppy disk or slip in a CD-Rom.  "The original game is gone from the world forever and legacy servers are the only way to preserve this vital part of gaming culture."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36148698	Nigel Farage predicts UKIP election 'breakthrough'	Nigel Farage claims UKIP is poised to make a "significant breakthrough" in next week's elections in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and London.  He said he was the "only party leader who has got a chance of winning seats in all four of them".  The party is also defending 200 seats on English local authorities and standing in police and crime commissioner elections.  UKIP has been hit by internal rows over candidate selection.  But Mr Farage insisted that had nothing to do with him, in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  He said he wanted to use the 5 May elections as a springboard for UKIP's campaign to get Britain out of the EU in 23 June's referendum - but denied the party was a "single issue" campaign.  "We have moved way beyond people voting UKIP as a protest, to send a message, and what we are seeing is a very strong consolidation of the UKIP vote.  "People now want to vote UKIP in every possible form of election. We have made some big advances in councils over the course of the last couple of years.  "And I do anticipate more of that on 5 May, but for me the big goal on 5 May is to win representation in the London Assembly, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Irish Assembly.  "I think I am the only party leader who has got a chance of winning seats in all four of them."  The UKIP leader has been touring the country to drum up support for UKIP's candidates, including six visits to Northern Ireland, where UKIP hopes to gain its first Stormont seat.  The party has never had any members of the Scottish Parliament either, although it gained its first MEP in Scotland in 2014. It has had London Assembly members in the past but does not currently have any.  Polls suggest the party is on course to gain its first seats on the Welsh assembly, where its candidates include former Conservative MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless.  Some UKIP activists claim the pair were imposed on Wales by party HQ in London at the expense of local contenders.  The party's leader in Wales, Nathan Gill, said he would "probably" not have selected Mr Hamilton, whose career as a Conservative MP was cut short by "cash-for-questions" allegations.  But Mr Farage said Mr Reckless and Mr Hamilton had been selected by UKIP members in Wales, adding: "That's party democracy."  He also said he had nothing to do with the decision to suspend prominent UKIP figure Suzanne Evans, seen as a potential leadership rival to him, for six months over allegations of bringing the party into disrepute.  But he declined to reinstate Ms Evans, who wanted to be a UKIP candidate in London, adding: "I don't think she behaved terribly well."  Mr Farage has recently spoken about his frustrations with the "volunteer" National Executive Committee that runs UKIP, suggesting the party needs a "professional management board".  He hinted an interview with the BBC's Andrew Neil that he planned a major shake-up of the party after the EU referendum, possibly remodelling it along the lines of Beppe Grillo's Five Star movement, in Italy, which uses online polling to choose candidates and decide policy.  "I think the model where we send money and get a membership card that we keep in our wallet is just old hat," he said on the BBC's This Week.  He said he wanted a "completely different approach to politics and I think that's where UKIP needs to go".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36149043	Volvo to test self-drive cars in UK	Swedish carmaker Volvo plans to run driverless car trials on public roads around London from next year.  Initially the cars will be semi-autonomous, with real families travelling in them.  Similar trials will run in the Swedish city Gothenburg.  Drive Me London, as the trial is dubbed, will record data from these everyday journeys to help develop the technology and adapt it to real-world conditions.  Details of which roads the cars will be tested on are not yet known. The trial is due to expand in 2018 from a handful of autonomous cars to 100, making it the largest of its kind in the UK.  "Autonomous driving (AD) represents a leap forward in car safety," said Håkan Samuelsson, president of Volvo Cars.  "The sooner AD cars are on the roads, the sooner lives will start being saved."  Up to 90% of car accidents are presently caused by driver error and research suggests that autonomous driving could reduce this by at least 30%.  Britain wants to be at the forefront of autonomous driving and, this summer, cars will take to the pavements around the O2 arena in Greenwich in London, as well as in Milton Keynes. Other driverless car trials are running in Coventry and Bristol.  This week in the US, Google - which is also at the forefront of the driverless car revolution - joined forces with Volvo and Ford, as well as taxi-hailing firms Uber and Lyft, to form a coalition to promote the benefits of self-driving cars and help push through the necessary legislation to make fully autonomous vehicles a reality.  Some experts predict that cars without a person in the driving seat could hit the roads as early as 2021 although, for that to happen, there need to be big changes in legislation around the world.  Mr Samuelsson said that there were "multiple benefits" to autonomous driving including the reduction of congestion and pollution, as well as safety.  "That is why governments globally need to put in place the legislation and infrastructure to allow AD cars onto the streets as soon as possible. The car industry cannot do it all by itself. We need governmental help."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36147593	Doubts cast over rural England elected mayor plans	Plans for new elected mayors announced in the Budget by the government should be abandoned, Conservatives have said.  Local councillors and some MPs say mayors for three rural parts of England will add an expensive and unwanted extra tier of government.  Councils could reject the idea and opt out of new authorities in Lincolnshire, the west of England and East Anglia, North Somerset MP Liam Fox said.  The government says it wants to help the local economy and devolve power.  Some Conservative councillors in the rural areas intend to try to block the policy, which will not be imposed on unwilling areas.  In his Budget in March, Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for elected mayors in the three areas.  Local authorities will vote on whether or not to accept detailed proposals by the end of June.  North West Norfolk MP Sir Henry Bellingham, said people would feel no affinity to a new authority and elections for a new mayor would attract a "pathetic" turnout.  He told the Today programme on Radio 4: "Now I don't want a regional leader coming along and saying look 'Henry you've been a bad boy, I gather you don't want this incinerator, you don't want these houses, well actually the region do want it and I'd like you to have it'.  "That is going to put MPs in a very difficult position and change their constitutional position."  While he supported the idea of devolution, he said plans for a new mayor should be put on hold.  A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said it was making "huge progress" in making local areas more powerful by devolving power from Whitehall.  A source close to the chancellor said: "The devolution revolution taking place across the country has unstoppable momentum behind it."  Six new authorities, which will have elected mayors, have been established in mainly urban areas, with another expected this summer.  Conservative sceptics argue the plans will not work in rural areas.  Passing extra powers to large authorities with accountable, high-profile mayors is one of the Mr Osborne's central aims.  Privately, some Conservatives have compared it to the government's attempt to turn all English schools into academies, accusing it of forcing the plan on reluctant councils.  One said councils had been "bribed and bullied" in a bid to make them accept the idea.  But a DCLG spokesman said: "The government is making huge progress towards rebalancing the economy and empowering local areas through the devolution of powers and resources away from Whitehall to local people.  "Ministers have been repeatedly clear that devolution is a genuinely bottom-up process - all proposals are agreed by local leaders, and the government will not impose an arrangement on any area."  Chris Skidmore, the Conservative MP for Kingswood near Bristol, said he supported the idea, and a new West of England mayor would create a "powerhouse in the south".  Directly-elected mayors would be put in place, he said, even if some authorities chose not to take part. He said: "If one council decides they don't want to do a deal, the other three will go ahead with the same pot of money given to those three councils."  Peterborough MP Stewart Jackson, who has secured a House of Commons debate on the topic, said politicians would not give the government a "blank cheque" to sign up for more local government with a weak mayor.  He said: "It's not something when you're talking of spending hundreds of millions of pounds over the next 30 years that any responsible elected politician accountable to their electorate can sign up to."  The leader of the Conservative group on Norfolk County Council, Cliff Jordan said he thought the council would reject the policy.  The Labour leader of the Council George Nobbs supports the idea of devolution but also opposes the policy in its current form.  Cambridgeshire County Council, which has a Conservative leader, has already voted to oppose the plan as it stands.  The Local Government Association wants local areas to be able to accept new powers and extra funding offered by the Treasury without having elected mayors.  A spokesman said: "People should be free to choose the appropriate model of robust governance for their community."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36139049	More polluting vehicle charge zones needed, say MPs	"Clean air zones" targeting drivers of high-polluting vehicles should be extended to more cities in England, the Commons environment committee has said.  MPs said more cities should get the enhanced powers being granted to London, Leeds, Birmingham, Nottingham, Derby and Southampton.  The powers allow cities to charge high-polluting vehicles to discourage them from entering the city centre.  The committee said tackling air quality was a priority.  The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs last year outlined the plans to introduce five clean air zones by 2020, after a Supreme Court ruling ordered it to comply with European Union law limits on nitrogen dioxide in the air. These five are in addition to the existing one in the capital.  The proposed clean air zones will only affect older - mainly diesel - buses, lorries, coaches and taxis, but will not apply to private cars.  Separately, London's mayor has announced that an "ultra low emission zone" being introduced in the centre of the capital from 2020 will apply to all vehicles, including private cars.  All six cities currently granted the enhanced powers were found to have the highest levels of nitrogen dioxide.  The government said the zones would both reduce pollution in city centres and encourage the replacement of older vehicles with higher emissions.  The report from the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said emissions had been declining significantly but there were 40-50,000 early deaths each year in the UK because of cardiac, respiratory and other diseases linked to air pollution.  Committee chairman Neil Parish, the Conservative MP for Tiverton and Honiton, said: "Only five cities... will have new powers to charge polluting vehicles to enter new clean air zones.  "Councils in the dozens of other English cities currently exceeding EU pollution limits must also be given the option of using such powers if their communities support action."  The current plans for the zones, added the report, imposed a "one size fits all" model.  It said local authorities must be given "greater flexibility in order that they can tailor measures to best meet their local circumstances.  "For example, cities may find it more effective to limit vehicle access at certain times of day or to target specific bus routes rather than adopt blanket access proposals."  The Local Government Association said councils wanted powers to be able to enforce traffic violations, like illegal U-turns and box junction offences, in the same way London councils can, to combat congestion hot spots.  It also wants more promotion of cycling, walking and public transport, and is calling on the government to fully fund the concessionary fares scheme and incentivise a move away from polluting diesel vehicles to non-diesel transport.  This report joins a growing body of challenge to government air pollution policy.  People are outraged by car firms cheating emissions tests. Parents are fed up of hearing their children are breathing harmful air. Campaigners are angry that ministers have tried to water down laws designed to protect public health.  And diesel drivers are annoyed at being blamed for running cars that government encouraged them to buy in the first place.  It took 400 years to clean up the capital's air from coal smoke, according to a new book - London Fog - by Christine Corton.  The government is being pressed to act faster to solve nitrogen pollution in all the UK's cities.  Air pollution has caught public attention by the scandal of car makers cheating emissions tests - and by successful court cases brought against the government under European law by the group ClientEarth.  Its spokesman Alan Andrews said a decision was due in weeks on further legal action on the adequacy of the government's plan to solve the problem.  He welcomed the MPs' report but told BBC News there was a further problem: "I can't understand why the MPs are willing to get even tougher on drivers whilst merely advising farmers how to reduce the ammonia coming off their manure heaps.  "The pollution from farms drifts across cities and harms people's health - there's been barely any reduction in it for a decade, so it's incredible that the farm lobby has managed to wriggle out of legislation."  The MPs' report says a cross-government approach is needed and calls for more action from the inter-departmental ministerial Clean Growth Group chaired by Oliver Letwin. The MPs say this group has no timetable, no minutes and needs to be less secretive.  A Defra spokesman said: "Tackling air quality is a priority for this government and our plans set out how we will achieve this through continued investment in clean technologies and by encouraging the uptake of low emission vehicles.  "Cities already have powers to introduce Clean Air Zones, and other air quality schemes, and our plans will require five cities to implement these zones...  "Later this year we will also consult on a clean air zone framework that will give local authorities the flexibility to make decisions about their own areas while ensuring a co-ordinated approach across the UK."	politics

The dryer contains a small air pump located in the handle which, the company says, makes it lighter and less noisy than rival devices.  Sensors in the device check the temperature making it less likely to overheat and damage the hair.  The company said it has spent £50m ($73m) and taken five years to develop the product.  BBC Click's Spencer Kelly visited the company's headquarters to find out more.  More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36111742	Dyson unveils 'quieter' £299 hairdryer	Dyson has revealed its first personal care product - a hairdryer that it says is quieter and less damaging to hair than a conventional machine.  It is the first hairdryer powered by a miniaturised air pump in the handle, using the same airflow principles as Dyson's desk fan products.  The company said it had invested £50m in the development of the device.  However, the £299 price tag makes it at least twice as expensive as salon-grade dryers made by rival manufacturers.  "People do spend a lot of money to take care of their hair," said Thidathip Tawichai, analyst at Euromonitor International.  "People in developed markets usually look after their personal care more and buy more expensive products.  "But £300 is very expensive and a lot to invest in a hairdryer. People like to follow fashions and spend a little money trying different things," she told the BBC.  Dyson is best known for its bagless vacuum cleaners and high-speed hand dryers, although it says it has a further 40 products in development.  The company's founder Sir James Dyson said developing a hairdryer was an "obvious" choice.  "There just happens to be a huge field in airflow," he told the BBC.  "We make very high-speed motors... so it's rather obvious that we would carry on and use that in everything involved in airflow."  The company said it had spent £50m investigating the "limitations" of conventional hairdryers. The biggest problem, according to Sir James, was that styling attachments and the dryer's proximity to hair slowed airflow and led to hair being overheated.  "If you overheat the hair, you get water bubbles in the cortex exploding and blasting holes in the fibres, which gives you a dull look and damaged hair," he told the BBC.  Defending the price of the hairdryer, which will cost more than some of the firm's latest vacuum cleaners, Sir James said: "We all spend 20-30 minutes every day doing our hair, so you use it an awful lot.  "Not damaging your hair, that's worth a lot of money."  Personal care analyst Roshida Khanom of Mintel said women in particular had started looking for products that were kinder to their hair.  "We found a high proportion of women are limiting their use of heat appliances and 20% had bought appliances that claim to be less damaging, so there's definitely a market for products that don't damage hair," she told the BBC.  While Dyson's hairdryer will be marketed at consumers as well as haircare professionals, Sir James said it was more important to satisfy customers than to appeal to a wide audience.  "It's not so much how many you sell that's important, it's whether people who buy it like it," he told the BBC.  "I don't mind if I only sell 100 a year, as long as those 100 people think it's really good. I wouldn't make much money but that's not always the point. That's not what drives us, that's not what makes it exciting."  The new hairdryer will first go on sale in Japan, where Dyson says 96% of people own a hairdryer.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35763753	Tomorrow's buildings: Smarter by design	The smartest buildings of the future will be those designed with people in mind, according to a new breed of architects trying to put the human at the centre of the process.  This can mean design that speaks directly to the function of a building - a hospital designed to help make people better or a school that aims to redefine education.  Or it may mean using technology to allow people to get involved in the design process or feedback on how they feel about living or working in a particular building.  As part of its Tomorrow's Buildings season, the BBC looks at four ideas that aim to do all of the above.  The new era of smart buildings is all about data - but, generally, what is being measured is practical stuff such as temperature, light, the number of people in a building at any given time.  But what if you could also measure the feelings of the people inside?  Consultant engineers Arup recently experimented with the idea of measuring just that.  It installed what it called a "sentiment cocoon" in its offices that sought to capture people's emotions throughout the day.  Designed by architect Moritz Behrens and lighting designer Konstantinos Mavromichalis, the 20m (65ft) cocoon structure encouraged workers to record their feelings via dashboards installed around their offices.  Individuals swiped their Oyster card (a smartcard used on the London Underground) or any other radio-frequency identification (RFID) card to log in and could choose from three different moods:  Their feelings were digitally projected into a light field created by LEDs running through the spine of the cocoon.  It was primarily designed as an art installation but could be developed to measure how people felt about a particular building.  In an age when data collection is everywhere, the smartest offices will be the ones that realise measuring people's response to the building is as important as measuring how light and heat perform, says Arup's director of architecture, Nille Juul-Sorensen.  "It is not enough to measure the mechanics of the buildings, we also need to collect information about how people react to them," he tells the BBC.  "Too often architects hand over the keys to clients and lose track of how people actually feel about the building.  "They might, for instance, tell us that the canteen is wonderful but that it is dark and not nice to sit in one particular corner."  When he was tasked with building a hospital in Rwanda, in 2011, architect Michael Murphy decided he wanted to build "the best hospital that we possibly can" - one that not only looked good but could help make people well.  That may not seem like such a radical idea but in fact, past projects in the country had cared little about the functionality of the building.  "The politicians and the doctors were saying that all they needed was something cheap and simple so that they could get to work," he told the BBC.  They were persuaded to build something a little better than just a shack to house beds and the final building fulfilled Mr Murphy's original vision.  It included some simple design ideas such as building waiting rooms on the outside to mitigate the risk of spreading airborne diseases, a novel way to ventilate the building and offering patients a view through a window, regarded as a good way to speed up recovery.  And it was cheaper - the final price tag was roughly two-thirds of what it would typically cost to build a hospital in Rwanda.  This was partly down to the use of local materials - such as nearby volcanic rock from the Virunga mountains - and the use of local workers to build it.  Mr Murphy's architectural practice MASS is part of a growing movement that aims to provide people-centric design and make everything locally.  "A smart building is something customised to its place, inhabitants and use," Mr Murphy told the BBC.  He is currently working on a new national hospital in post-Ebola Liberia that will, among other things, seek to find ways to make sure the disease does not return.  The Edge, Deloitte's headquarters in Amsterdam, has been described as the smartest building in the world and the firm is already planning the next one - in London.  Ed Greig, who goes by the glorious title of Deloitte's Disrupter, is heavily involved in the planning and wants the London building to be "even smarter than The Edge".  As well as learning from what worked well and what didn't in the Netherlands, the team behind the new London HQ want to use innovative technology to help the decision process, including virtual reality headsets.  "The shell hasn't been finished yet but when we get the first iterations of the design from the architects, we will model them in virtual reality to give people a look inside before we've even opened a tin of paint," he told the BBC.  Hundreds of employees will be invited to give their opinions.  "Obviously if someone says that they want neon green then that might not work - it will be about finding ways to accommodate people's ideas."  He thinks it can help avoid trendy designs that actually don't work.  "Often offices are designed to look good on first impressions but they are not on repeated everyday use.  "Someone might think it is a cool idea to have a huge picture of a pink sheep but if people have to look at that every day, they might realise that the picture is stopping them thinking creatively."  Danish architects CEBRA have recently won an international design competition for their educational complex in Irkutsk, Russia.  It does not look like a standard school and the architects are hoping that it will change the way children are educated as well.  One of the key ideas is to build the school around a meadow - bringing nature into the classroom but also bringing the classroom more into the local community. Outdoor lessons will be a regular feature and all the classrooms look out on to it.  The huge meadow, which will be built on barren land, will also be a focal point for the local town, which is more than 10,000 miles (16,000km) from Moscow. Users who are not part of the school can access the meadow but not the buildings.  For lead architect Carsten Primdahl, the project is about "a smart way of thinking about organising education and a school's relationship to the community".  A quarter of the students at the school will be orphans, who will live on site in small villas of around eight children in an attempt to make them very much at the heart of the school community.  Rather than the traditional school corridors, the building will have multi-functional spaces - including a green-screen area and a "black" room that can act as either a meeting place or a room to develop photographs.  The firm is also working on another school, also in Russia, that will be located close to incubator businesses to allow children to learn about entrepreneurship.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36146561	Trade Union Bill: E-voting review among expected changes	A review of whether to allow electronic voting in strike ballots is expected to be part of further changes to the government's Trade Union Bill.  Ministers are also expected to delay controversial changes to unions' political funds.  The bill, which has faced fierce criticism from unions and the Labour Party, is returning before MPs after a series of defeats in the Lords.  Downing Street said it was trying to "get the balance right".  Last week the government backed down over plans to end the right of workers to pay union subscriptions by deducting them from their wages.  The e-voting review was one of the amendments made by the House of Lords when it defeated the government in votes on the bill last month.  As part of the government's response to that defeat, changes are also expected to reforms planned for unions' political levies, according to BBC political correspondent Carole Walker.  Ministers want to require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party.  If an opt-in is introduced, Labour believes three million fewer members of the biggest unions would agree to pay into them, costing it £6m.  The government is expected to press ahead with the reform but to give unions 12 months, rather than three months, to introduce it.  Peers said the changes should apply to new members only.  David Cameron's spokeswoman said: "The bill is going through the usual parliamentary process in the House where members of Parliament have the opportunity to voice views and raise concerns and the government can look at those and respond appropriately."  The TUC has called the bill "unnecessary, anti-democratic and unfair".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36146116	Government defeated again in Lords over child refugees	The government has been defeated again in the House of Lords over calls to take in child refugees from Europe.  A new amendment to the Immigration Bill from Labour's Lord Dubs was backed by 279 votes to 172.  It would force ministers to arrange the relocation of children who have made it to Europe into the UK, with the total number to be decided by the government.  The government has warned against encouraging people to place children in the hands of traffickers.  It announced last week it would take in as many as 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  But campaigners, including charity Save the Children, are calling for unaccompanied children who have already made it into Europe to be allowed into the UK.  On Monday night, MPs rejected Lord Dubs' attempt to force the government to admit 3,000 children from Europe.  His revised amendment - which was backed by the Lords - did not include the 3,000 target, instead requiring the government to consult with local authorities to come up with a total.  Labour peer Lord Dubs arrived in the UK in 1939 as a six-year-old refugee fleeing the persecution of Jews in Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia.  He was one of 669 children who escaped the Holocaust on trains from Prague organised by British stockbroker Sir Nicholas Winton.  After a 48-hour journey, the young Alf Dubs was met by his father, who had fled to England the day the Nazis entered Czechoslovakia, at Liverpool Street station in London.  In the Lords debate, Home Office minister Earl Howe said the issue of child refugees was "highly emotive" and that the UK had a "moral duty to help those in need".  He said the government was "already fulfilling that duty", adding that "physically transporting unaccompanied children from one part of the EU to another is not the best or most effective way to fulfil our duty".  Lord Dubs said he welcomed government support for refugees, but added: "When all is said and done, the government will still leave thousands of children in Europe.  "Children who are vulnerable, children who are in an unhappy situation, children who are in danger possibly even to their lives and certainly to their wellbeing."  He said he was "astonished" at the support for his amendment.  Speaking before the vote, the prime minister's spokeswoman said the government wanted to protect vulnerable people but not "fuel a system that is incentivising people to be exploited by trafficking gangs and make perilous journeys".  The government suffered further defeats on the Immigration Bill over the detention of pregnant women in immigration custody and holding people in detention for more than 28 days.

It is part of a wider campaign to enhance the safety of women, in the light of growing concerns about levels of sexual violence in the country.  From 2018, phones will also have to include GPS navigation systems.  India does not have a centralised emergency number but officials are looking to introduce one this year.  Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Communications and Information Technology, said: "Technology is solely meant to make human life better and what better than using it for the security of women?"  The National Crime Records Bureau said there were 337,922 reports of violence against women, including rape, molestation, abduction and cruelty in 2014, including 36,000 rapes, a rise of 9% on the previous year's figures.  It is likely that the real incidence of rape is much higher than official figures suggest.  It is not yet clear how the panic button system will work but it is likely to allow customers to call the emergency services by either pressing a single button or by pressing the power button several times in succession.  Women's safety has risen to the top of the political agenda in India since the fatal gang rape of a 23 year-old medical student on a bus in Delhi in 2012 sparked new anti-rape laws in the country.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36139986	Google partners Uber on driverless cars	Google has formed a coalition with carmakers and taxi-hailing companies to help steer the regulations needed to make self-drive cars a reality.  Including Ford, Volvo, Uber and Lyft, it will lobby lawmakers and regulators on some of the legal barriers.  Former US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration official David Strickland will be its spokesman.  The coalition also aims to convince the public of the benefits of driverless cars.  "Self-driving technology will enhance public safety and mobility for the elderly and disabled, reduce traffic congestion, improve environmental quality, and advance transportation efficiency," the group said in a statement.  Fully autonomous vehicles are not legal under current regulations, and California is considering barring self-drive cars that do not have:  Google has opposed the move and wants to avoid a patchwork of differing state regulations.  In a Senate hearing on autonomous vehicles, Google's self-driving cars chief, Chris Urmson, pointed out 23 states already had a total of 53 pieces of legislation related to the topic.  The NHTSA is due to release guidance on self-drive vehicles to states and policymakers in July.  In February, it said the system behind a self-driving Google car could be considered the driver under federal law, which was seen as a major step towards rubber-stamping fully autonomous vehicles.  Last year, there were 33,000 fatalities on American roads, according to the US Department of Transport.  Human error caused 94% of road accidents, and car crashes were the leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds, it said.  In China, a university group backed by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is drawing up a plan for self-drive cars that could see autonomous vehicles on city streets within three to five years.  It will include technical standards, a common language for cars to communicate with each other as well as regulatory guidelines.	tech

Naz Shah has apologised for sharing the graphic showing Israel's outline superimposed onto a map of the US with the comment "problem solved".  It was shared in 2014, before she became Bradford West MP.  The Board of Deputies said the post, highlighted by the Guido Fawkes political website, was "appalling".  The graphic said relocating Israel would be a "solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict", and that it would allow Palestinians to "get their life and their land back".  In a statement, Ms Shah said: "This post from two years ago was made before I was an MP, does not reflect my views and I apologise for any offence it has caused."  Labour confirmed she had stepped down as Parliamentary Private Secretary - an unpaid backbench assistant - to shadow chancellor John McDonnell.  In a second statement, the MP said: "I made these posts at the height of the Gaza conflict in 2014, when emotions were running high around the Middle East conflict.  "But that is no excuse for the offence I have given, for which I unreservedly apologise."  She said she would be expanding her "existing engagement and dialogue with Jewish community organisations and will be stepping up my efforts to combat all forms of racism, including anti-Semitism".  The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the comments were "simply appalling", calling for an urgent meeting "for clarification of her views on Israel and the UK Jewish community".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36138998	Gaming platform Steam strikes film deal with Lionsgate	Steam, the digital gaming platform, has started offering Hollywood film rentals to users after signing a deal with production studio Lionsgate.  It will add more than 100 titles to Steam's online store and streaming service, including The Hunger Games, Twilight, and Saw franchises.  The full range is available to US users initially, with European customers having access to a small selection.  Lionsgate said availability would increase during a global rollout.  Steam, which is owned by game developer Valve, is the most popular digital games retailer, with more than 125 million users. The platform sells games through direct download, with extra gaming features like a friends' list and voice communication, built into the client.  It's not the first time Steam has released video through its store. Game trailers and advertisements have been available for years, and it previously released gaming-related documentaries Free to Play and Indie Game: The Movie.  It also struck a deal to sell the Mad Max film franchise to coincide with the release of the video game of the same name last year.  The deal with Lionsgate, however, is the first large-scale agreement with a major production company. A spokesperson for Valve said Lionsgate's blockbuster franchises represent the type of entertainment it hopes will drive the continued expansion of their content catalogue.  On launch, the worldwide selection is limited to 11 older titles, priced between £3.49 - £5.59 for a 48-hour rental - in line with other online rental prices for new releases. Unlike some of its competitors, however, Steam operates on almost any computer platform - including Linux and Mac - but does not yet offer its streaming service to mobile apps.  "Valve has a track record of diversifying beyond games with its Steam platform by selling other forms of software and as a company is willing to test out various technologies and commercial models to see what works," said Piers Harding-Rolls, head of games research at IHS Technology.  "Steam also offers a global distribution platform with users in all major markets and, for now, very little video content competition. It also aligns with Valve's move into virtual reality with Steam VR, where platforms are taking advantage of 2D video content which is being consumed through VR headsets.  "I think this is a smart move from Lionsgate and could deliver a decent incremental revenue stream from its catalogue. "	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36139310	Beautiful People dating site data sold online	Data stolen from a dating website aimed at "beautiful people only" has been traded online.  The details of more than a million members including their weight, height, job, and phone numbers were discovered unencrypted online in December 2015.  They have now been sold on the black market, said security expert Troy Hunt.  The firm said the data belonged to members who joined before July 2015 and that no passwords or financial information were included.  Security researcher Chris Vickery, who originally discovered it, told the BBC the firm acted quickly after he notified them - but by then, data had already been sold on.  "They published it openly to the world with no protection whatsoever," he said.  Beautiful People originally claimed the content was from a test server but Mr Vickery said the data itself was still genuine.  "Whether or not it's in the test database makes no difference if it's real data," he added.  "The breach involves data that was provided by members prior to mid-July 2015. No more recent user data or any data relating to users who joined from mid-July 2015 onward is affected," Beautiful People said in a statement.  Beautiful People has been contacted by the BBC for further comment.  Now the compromised data appears to have been sold on the black market, security expert Troy Hunt told Forbes.  "Now it's public, cybercriminals have the opportunity to use this information to steal personal identities or more," said David Emm, principal security researcher at Kaspersky Lab.  "Unfortunately, once a breach of this nature has been made, there is not much that can be done."  Cybercriminals use the genuine identities to synthesise new ones, and they tend to act within a month of receiving stolen data, said John Lord, managing director at identity data intelligence firm GBG.  "Organisations need to take action and use more data, analytical insights and triangulation of multiple-identity proofing techniques to minimise the potential effects of identity theft for both the user and the businesses serving them," he said.  People hoping to join the Beautiful People website submit photographs which are then rated by existing members of the opposite sex for 48 hours.  If they get enough positive votes, they are then granted membership.  The firm claims more than 700 marriages have taken place between people who met on its website.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36139981	US government drops another iPhone case against Apple	The US government has dropped a case against Apple that sought to compel the company to provide access to an alleged New York drug dealer's locked iPhone.  The Department of Justice said Apple's help was no longer necessary as the passcode had been obtained.  A similar case involving a phone used by the San Bernardino gunman was dropped when the FBI got help from a third-party to unlock the handset.  The DoJ denied either case was about setting a court precedent.  The cases revolve around cracking the four digital security number that accesses the phone without triggering a security feature that erases all data after 10 incorrect guesses.  The FBI has not revealed who helped it to unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino killer Syed Rizwan Farook - but, last week, it emerged it had probably paid more than $1.3m (£900,000) for the service.  Farook and his wife killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, in December. Both were shot dead by police.  The FBI argued that it needed access to the phone's data to determine if the attackers worked with or were supported by other people and were planning other targets.  Meanwhile, in Massachusetts, Apple has been ordered to help the FBI gain access to data on an iPhone belonging to an alleged Boston gang member accused of shooting a rival.  The judge ordered Apple to give "reasonable technical assistance", but Apple has not complied.  According to Apple, it received more than 5,000 similar requests from the government in the first six months of 2015.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36130407	Email 'most popular phishing tool'	Cyber-thieves are sticking to email as their preferred way to trick victims into falling for scams, suggests a report.  The online crime groups were shunning mobiles and newer technologies in favour of phishing campaigns, said the report from Verizon.  The annual analysis catalogues more than 100,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2015.  Almost 90% of the incidents involved attempts to steal cash, it said.  The gangs were sticking to booby-trapped emails because they were proving increasingly effective, said Marc Spitler, lead author on the report.  And, so far, there was little evidence novel technologies involving net-connected gadgets or smartphones were becoming a popular attack route.  About 30% of phishing emails had been opened by people in targeted organisations in 2015, said the report, up from 23% in 2014.  And, of the scam emails opened, about 13% had been able to launch malware because staff had run the attachments they had carried.  This meant, said Mr Spitler, it often took just minutes for criminals to compromise the network of a targeted company.  "If an attack works, then it works very quickly," he said.  "The phishing email typically leads to the installation of malware or the compromise of a user's PC by some sort of malicious code that can establish control or persistence on a network," said Mr Spitler.  Unfortunately, he added, although companies fell victim quickly, they could take far longer to notice they had been breached.  Statistics gathered for the Verizon report suggest 84% of the organisations questioned took weeks to spot that criminals had won access to internal systems.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35934899	Fullscreen launches YouTube subscription video rival	Online talent firm Fullscreen has launched its own subscription video platform to rival YouTube's offering.  Until now, Fullscreen has worked with social media talent on free platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube.  But the company said the economics of producing premium video on ad-supported platforms "did not work out".  One industry analyst questioned whether Fullscreen had the brand recognition necessary to attract a big audience.  Fullscreen describes itself as a "modern media company", part talent agency, part content producer. It has a roster of 75,000 "partners", predominantly recruited through YouTube.  The company has traditionally made money by brokering advertising deals for its talent, providing support to smaller video-makers in exchange for a cut of their ad revenue, and by selling tour tickets and merchandise for its biggest stars.  But it said it had needed to create its own subscription video platform to let video-makers "fulfil their artistic ambition".  "Social media is a great place to make quick, inexpensive content to engage a fanbase," Fullscreen founder George Strompolos told the BBC.  "But when it comes to longer form or premium productions, the economics of producing it on the free web just don't work out.  "We needed to create a premium destination for that work that has a higher quality."  Consumers are increasingly rejecting expensive cable television packages and instead subscribing to individual streaming services, known as over-the-top services.  In October 2015, Google launched its own bid to capture a new market with a premium video service called YouTube Red.  Its service features prominent YouTubers in long-form productions, although Google has not yet revealed how many paid members it has attracted.  "There is some overlap with YouTube Red, they are both subscription options featuring some programming with YouTube stars," said Mr Strompolos.  "But YouTube Red is more about an ad-free experience and music, with some programming sprinkled in. We're leading with original programmes. It's not icing on cake, it is the cake."  Undercutting Google's $9.99 (£6.90) offering, Fullscreen's subscription service will cost $4.99 (£3.40) a month, with programmes viewable on a standalone app and website.  British comedians Jack Howard and Dean Dobbs, and US vlogger Shane Dawson are among the popular video-makers involved.  The company said it would bolster its offer of online originals with traditional programmes from TV and film studios.  "Fullscreen has an umbrella of big name channels on YouTube, but the brand itself is not particularly well known," said Tom Harrington, an industry analyst at Enders.  "They have some decent looking original programming planned, but these services live and die on their back catalogue, and old episodes of Dawson's Creek will only get you so far.  "It's an increasingly crowded market, and it's hard to think they would have the same recognition to get noticed as Amazon, Disney and Netflix."  Mr Strompolos is confident the service will find an audience.  "This generation grew up on social media, falling in love with stars like Grace Helbig, and Jack and Dean," said Mr Strompolos.  "Part of being a fan of a creator is that you are empowering them to reach new heights - you get them to a place where they can realise their ambitions.  "But we also think about empowering talent, giving them a great experience and creating a friendly collaboration.  "Ultimately, the service that the talent wants to win, is the service that wins."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36128184	Facebook hacker discovers traces of other intruder	A hacker looking for ways to breach Facebook's internal network has uncovered traces of another hacker who got there first.  The Taiwanese researcher found files left behind by the other intruder on a neglected Facebook server.  The former hacker was using tools to scoop up login names of Facebook's net admin staff.  Facebook said the traces were left by another security researcher also seeking loopholes in its systems.  In a blog post, security researcher Orange Tsai detailed the way he found the vulnerable server and his realisation that someone else had been there before him.  The earlier intruder had set up scripts to grab the login names and other credentials for Facebook employees. At first glance, he said it looked like a "pretty serious security incident".  Mr Tsai, who works for security firm Devcore, reported his findings to Facebook so it could harden the server and clean out the login-sniffing scripts.  He won a $10,000 (£7,000) bug bounty from Facebook for finding the vulnerable server. In a statement on the Hacker News site, Facebook said it was "really glad" that Mr Tsai reported his findings.  "After incident response, we determined that the activity Orange detected was in fact from another researcher who participates in our bounty program," it said.  Facebook described the discovery of the vulnerable server as a "double win" as it involved two competent researchers assessing its systems. Neither was able to get further than the server to get full access to the site's internal networks, it added.  Paul Ducklin, writing on the blog of security firm Sophos, said anyone planning to do similar work on other net firms should be more careful.  "We recommend that you don't go as far as either hacker in this case." he wrote. "Orange stretched the rules a bit; the earlier mystery hacker stretched them a lot."  Going too far might introduce new weaknesses, warned Mr Ducklin.  "You don't make security stronger by weakening it," he said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36128745	Millions of Mexican voter records 'were accessible online'	A massive database of Mexican voter records was made publicly accessible on the internet, a US security researcher has discovered.  The names, addresses, dates of birth and voter ID numbers of 87 million Mexicans appeared to be listed in the cache.  It was discovered by Chris Vickery, who had been browsing unsecured databases, with a security tool called Shodan.  The voter data has since been taken offline.  "When I opened it up in my database, viewer I saw names, obvious addresses and identifying numbers. I started Googling the addresses to see where they were," Mr Vickery told the BBC.  "All the addresses turned out to be in Mexico. I thought, 'This is a Mexican voter database - it has to be.'"  Mr Vickery had made his discovery on 14 April, he said, and initially had trouble reaching an official to warn about the leak.  After mentioning the database during a talk at Harvard last week, a Mexican who happened to be in the audience helped to authenticate the data.  "He was able to authenticate his father's entry in the database - he said, 'Oh my God, that's my address, that's everything,'" said Mr Vickery.  A journalist, also present at the talk, helped Mr Vickery to inform the Mexican National Electoral Institute, which organises federal elections in the country.  The institute has since released a statement in Spanish about the data's publication online.  "A copy of the electoral register has been found in a file storage site of the US company Amazon," it reads.  "An internal investigation has been launched and the case has been reported to the special prosecutor for electoral crimes."  Once the authorities had been notified, steps were taken to remove the information from Amazon's cloud servers. This was done by 22 April.  "All [Amazon Web Services] security features and networks continue to operate as designed," Amazon said in a statement.  "On April 21, AWS was notified that an unsecured database containing sensitive information was being hosted on the AWS cloud and was publicly accessible via the internet.  "We then notified the customer by both email and phone.  "As of 01:00 [local time] on 22 April, this database was no longer publicly accessible."  Mr Vickery said he had since been invited to Mexico as a guest of the government and planned to accept the invitation if his wife was able to join him on the trip.  "The embassy told me I was on the cover of every major Mexican newspaper on Saturday," he said.  "I want to get my hands on one of those newspapers."  Recently, the details of 70 million voters in the Philippines were reported to have leaked online.  And in December last year, Mr Vickery found a cache of data on 191 million US voters after a database was made accessible via the web.  Speaking on the dangers of this sort of data being made public, Mr Vickery said it could sometimes be used by scammers.  "They call up old people and tell them they have a virus," he said.  The scammers then give the victims instructions that result in malware being installed on their computers.  "It's a huge problem over here," Mr Vickery said.  And in Mexico in particular, he said - where up to 100,000 people are kidnapped every year - data on people's home addresses could be considered particularly sensitive.  Alex Cruz Farmer at security company NSFocus IB said: "This is a significant breach, and what makes it worse is that the data was being held outside of Mexico."  Mr Cruz Farmer said data-governance rules in the country forbade exporting people's personal information outside the country without their permission.  "As Mr Vickery has quite rightly raised, the concern over what the data could be used for is extremely distressing," he added.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36116584	EE aims to improve 4G and relocate customer services	Mobile phone operator EE is aiming to bring 4G to 95% of the UK landmass by 2020 as well as relocating its customer services to the UK and Ireland.  In 2015, the firm was fined £1m ($1.4m) by communications watchdog Ofcom over customer service failings.  The network will also switch on high-speed 4G in the Shetland Islands and the Isles of Scilly this week.  Chief Executive Marc Allera told the BBC customers expected to be able to access the internet wherever they were.  Currently, 4G coverage is measured as a percentage of the population rather than geographically.  That means mobile networks typically focus on areas where lots of people live rather than extending geographical reach of their services.  "The Isles of Scilly have 2,000 residents but 200,000 visitors," said Mr Allera.  "Increasingly, the expectations from customers are that they can get access to the internet wherever they go."  BT-owned EE's ambitions for 4G go beyond the government's target for operators, which is to provide voice and text coverage to only 90% of UK landmass by the end of 2017.  "I don't believe as an industry we should say a beach is covered unless it has 4G coverage," said Mr Allera.  This demand for 4G may help mobile networks tackle public opposition to infrastructure such as transmitter masts required to enable it, he added.  "The barriers we need to overcome are around how fast and easy we can get access to these sites [where the masts can be built], and also how we ensure we don't have landlords who can charge ransom rates which make it prohibitive for us to put in a solution," he said.  "We're working on those reforms but we can't do this by ourselves."  EE is working with the government to tackle the issue, Mr Allera said.  Ovum analyst Matthew Howe said reforms were "vital" for the success of the strategy.  "Unless the government takes a lead on ensuring fair and reasonable access and site rentals, EE's hopes for 95% coverage will be fraught with difficulty," he said.  EE said it also aimed to bring all its customer services operations back to the UK and Ireland from overseas by the end of 2016.  "People look at off-shoring as reducing costs but when you look at the added cost of unhappy customers... actually this isn't going to be an enormous incremental cost."  He declined to say whether customers would face price rises as a result but said that the competitiveness of the market would "ensure we focus on value for money".	tech

Mr Farron said his party would support Labour's bid to commit the UK to admitting 3,000 unaccompanied minors.  He said the UK should take its "fair share" of children who have already arrived in Europe, in addition to those it plans to resettle from Syria.  The government said it was taking action to help child refugees.  Home Secretary Theresa May said: "We're putting £10m into being able to being able to provide help and support for children who are in Europe."  On Monday the House of Commons will vote on a Labour amendment to the Immigration Bill to allow 3,000 child refugees into the UK.  The government announced last week it would take in as many as 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  This is on top of David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by the end of the decade.  But speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Farron said it was not enough, saying there were an estimated 30,000 lone refugee children already in Europe at risk of being trafficked or abused.  It was time for the UK to take its "fair share" and resettle 3,000 of them within its borders, the Lib Dem leader argued.  "I've been to the camps, I've seen families absolutely devastated, people who've fled war and persecution, the threat of death for them and their children and they took an enormously risky decision to cross the water the come to Europe. Why? Because what they left behind was riskier still," he said.  He added: "My question to every Conservative MP, to Theresa May and to David Cameron, is, 'If you were in the situation of these Syrian refugees, if your children were like these unaccompanied children in Europe now, what would you want other countries to do for you?' The answer is obvious," he added.  Some Conservatives MPs are believed to be considering backing Labour's amendment and Mr Farron predicted a government defeat was on the cards.  When asked if he thought they could win the vote, he said: "Yes, of course we can."  Home Secretary Theresa May said: "The question we need to ask ourselves, and we've worked with the UNHCR, is, 'What is in the best interests of these children?'"  Referring to the government's resettlement scheme she said: "That is about children at risk coming from the region, not just unaccompanied children because sometimes they can have a family member or a guardian with them but still be at risk, for example of exploitation or forced marriage."  "And also, we're putting £10m into being able to provide help and support for children who are in Europe," she added.  The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region and the UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk.  The UK government's scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage.  It will resettle children and their families "where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child".  Labour peer Lord Dubs - who has tabled the amendment to be debated on Monday - said that, while welcome, it "doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment."  He also questioned whether "the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate".	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36117907	Backlash after Barack Obama EU referendum intervention	US President Barack Obama has been accused of doing Downing Street's bidding - after he said the UK would be at "the back of the queue" for American trade deals if it left the EU.  Mr Obama was criticised by pro-Brexit campaigners after he warned of the consequences of the UK leaving the EU.  UKIP's Nigel Farage said Mr Obama was "talking down Britain", while Tory Liam Fox said his views were "irrelevant".  Mr Obama, on a three-day UK visit, will meet Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn later.  In a speech in London, the US president urged young people to "reject pessimism and cynicism" and to "know that progress is possible and our problems can be solved".  "Progress is not inevitable," he said and must be fought for. "Take a longer, more optimistic view of history."  Mr Obama's intervention on the EU issue came on his first full day in the UK and comes just weeks ahead of the 23 June in-out referendum.  Speaking at a joint news conference with Prime Minister David Cameron on Friday, Mr Obama said the US "wants Britain's influence to grow - including within Europe".  "The UK is at its best when it's helping to lead a strong European Union. It leverages UK power to be part of the EU.  "I don't think the EU moderates British influence in the world, it magnifies it."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Obama's message on trade was "very blunt" and "really upped the ante" in the referendum debate.  Leave campaigner Mr Farage drew attention to the US president's terminology, saying his use of the phrase "back of the queue" rather than the more common American vernacular "back of the line" suggested Mr Obama was doing the prime minister's "bidding".  "I think that's shameful," he added.  Mr Fox said Mr Obama would be leaving the White House soon, and therefore his comments were "largely irrelevant".  Conservative MP Dominic Raab labelled Mr Obama a "lame-duck American president doing an old British friend a political favour".  Downing Street rejected suggestions that any lines had been fed to Mr Obama, saying the US president spoke for himself.  Sir Andrew Cahn, a former chief executive of UK Trade & Investment, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Britain would "miss out on something very important and valuable" if it left the EU and was not part of a proposed trade deal between the bloc and the US.  Former foreign secretary Lord Owen said "Britain needs to create new markets away from the EU".  Meanwhile, another prominent Leave campaigner - former cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith - has tried to move the referendum debate on to immigration.  In an article in the Daily Mail, he says the introduction of a national living wage - a move he supported while in government - will "surely lead to another stampede to our borders".  He adds: "To make the Living Wage work for British people, we need to be able to control the number of people coming in."  Earlier on Saturday, Mr Obama visited the Globe Theatre, where celebrations marking the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death are taking place.  He watched actors perform several scenes from Hamlet, later joining them on stage.  "That was wonderful. I didn't want it to stop," he said.  Later, he will hold talks with Labour leader Mr Corbyn.

Mr Johnson said the removal of a bust of Churchill from Obama's office was seen by some as a sign of an "ancestral dislike of the British Empire".  The comments in article for The Sun were branded "idiotic" and "deeply offensive" by Churchill's grandson.  Mr Obama made clear his admiration for Britain's wartime leader in pointed remarks at a press conference.  He did not mention Mr Johnson by name but said he had a bust of Churchill outside the Treaty Room - his private office on the second floor of his official residence.  "Right outside the door of the Treaty Room, so that I see it every day - including on weekends when I'm going into that office to watch a basketball game - the primary image I see is a bust of Winston Churchill," he said.  "It's there voluntarily because I can do anything on the second floor. I love the guy."  It had been in the Oval Office, he said, but: "There are only so many tables where you can put busts otherwise it starts to looks a little cluttered."  As the first African American president, he said, a bust of Martin Luther King would be "appropriate", to remind him "of all the hard work of a lot of people who somehow allow me to have the privilege of holding this office".  He added: "That's just on Winston Churchill. I think people should know that, know my thinking there."  Mr Johnson said he was "delighted" by Mr Obama's backing for Churchill, but did not respond to questions about whether he had been trying to suggest the US President had a grudge against Britain.  Speaking earlier on a visit to a fast food restaurant in his Uxbridge constituency, Mr Johnson said: "The crucial point is that I'm a big fan of Barack Obama - I was one of the first people to come out in favour of him ages ago.  "But I think there's a weird paradox when the President of the Unites States, a country that would never dream of sharing its sovereignty over anything, instructs or urges us politely to get more embedded in the EU, which is already making 60% of our laws.  "I think the issue really is about democracy - America guards its democracy very jealously and I think we should be entitled to do so as well."  Downing Street said Mr Johnson was recycling "false" claims in relation to Churchill's bust.  Churchill's grandson, Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, who is campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, called the article "deplorable" and "completely idiotic".  He told LBC Radio: "I like to think, possibly - I'm mad enough to think - that it was probably written by some little twerp who works for Boris. I can't believe that Boris would really have done something so stupid, but whatever it is it bears his name and it is deeply offensive."  Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for Mr Johnson to withdraw his comment, writing on Twitter: "Mask slips again. Boris part-Kenyan Obama comment is yet another example of dog whistle racism from senior Tories."  Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Campbell of Pittenweem said Mr Johnson's comments constituted an "unacceptable smear".  But UKIP leader Nigel Farage defended the comments, saying: "I think Obama, because of his grandfather and Kenya and colonisation, I think Obama bears a bit of a grudge against this country."  Stories about the removal of the Churchill bust were described by the White House in 2012 as "100% false".  "The bust still in the White House. In the Residence. Outside the Treaty Room," a senior adviser said in a rebuttal.  A Churchill bust lent to President George Bush by Tony Blair was removed from the Oval Office along with other art lent to the Bush presidency after Mr Obama's 2009 inauguration "as is common practice at the end of every presidency", the White House said at the time.  A separate bust of Britain's wartime leader, that has been in the White House since the early 1960s, remains on display.  Mr Johnson said in his article: "No-one was sure whether the president had himself been involved in the decision", adding: "Some said it was a snub to Britain. Some said it was a symbol of the part-Kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the British Empire - of which Churchill had been such a fervent defender."  The London mayor, who penned a best-selling biography of Churchill, was born in New York but recently said he intends to renounce his American citizenship to prove his "commitment to Britain".	politics

Regulations were unveiled in March that outlawed foreign ownership of online publishing services.  The rules also required that all content shown to Chinese people must be stored on servers based on the Chinese mainland.  Apple said it hoped access to the services would be restored soon.  Currently, anyone in China who visits the iBooks store or tries to use iTunes Movies service is greeted with a message in Chinese saying the services were "unusable", reports Reuters. Both services have only been available in China for about six months.  The move has widely been seen as a blow to Apple which is keen to ensure its products are popular and sell well in China, because the region is the second biggest market for its products. The shutdown comes only days before Apple reports its second quarter financial results.  The services were shut down on the orders of China's media watchdog - the State Administration of Press, Publication, Radio, Film and Television. The action is believed to be part of a wider attempt by China's government to consolidate its control over the internet and media organisations.  China has defended the restrictions saying online publishing had to be monitored to combat terrorism and foreign ideas that could prove harmful.  The strict rules are also seen as a way to foster the success of indigenous net Chinese firms such as Huawei, Alibaba and Tencent.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36105738	Connected tech aims to protect rhinos from poaching	New technology to combat rhino poaching is being trialled in South Africa.  In a tie-up between South African technology firm Dimension Data and networking giant Cisco, the technology will track vehicles and people entering the reserve rather than animals.  There are only about 25,000 rhinos left in the wild, with the majority in South Africa.  It is estimated that about 1,000 are killed each year, primarily for their horn.  The firms have set up a local area network and wi-fi hotspots around the private, unnamed reserve, which is adjacent to the Kruger national park.  The next stage will be to link CCTV and infra-red cameras with thermal imaging, drones and vehicle tracking sensors to the network.  Tracking sensors are placed on vehicles and people are informed about the tracking when they enter the reserve. Car registrations are also checked at the gate against a national database of stolen cars and personal IDs are scrutinised.  The plan is to replicate it in other reserves not just to protect rhinos but other endangered species including elephants, lions and tigers.  Drones have been used before to help conservation efforts and last year British scientists from the University of St Andrews showed off a system dubbed Protect Rapid (real-time anti-poaching intelligence device) that combined a satellite collar with a heart-rate monitor and video cameras that are embedded in rhino's horns.  The heart-rate monitor triggers the alarm and rangers are immediately dispatched.  There are other schemes to place microchips under the skin of the animals.  One of the key advantages of the new system is that it is non-invasive, said Dimension Data executive Bruce Watson.  "We don't touch the animals by darting them with tranquilisers to insert sensors into their horns, or insert a chip under their skin. This can be extremely stressful and risky for the animal and we've seen a number of rhinos either dying, or going blind, and having to be euthanised."  Dr Paul Glover-Kapfer, the World Wildlife Fund's technology adviser, told the BBC that technology was "an increasing factor" in WWF's global work.  "The system outlined by Cisco and Data Dimensions, whilst not a panacea, is a welcome addition on this front."  But he questioned how applicable it would be "outside of well-funded protected areas".  "To be truly transformative, technology needs to be accessible, both in terms of its technical complexity and affordability.  Connectivity in particular is a huge challenge facing many conservation organisations, and WWF is working with technology leaders to design systems for real-time data transfer to and from the remote areas within which we work."	tech

The estimate is far more than the 350,000 headsets that were sent out last year, it said.  Some of the growth will be down to the first consumer-ready versions reaching customers, said the firm.  However, most numerous will be the "screenless" systems that use smartphones as their main display.  IDC said it expected about two million headsets from Oculus, HTC and Sony to be shipped to consumers in 2016. The Oculus Rift headset began shipping on 28 March, HTC Vive headsets are due to start being dispatched this month and Sony's PlayStation VR should be available in October.  All these headsets are called "tethered" systems because they work with a PC or a game console that pipes images to their display.  Consumers will buy these headsets because they want to play video games in VR, said Lewis Ward, director of gaming at IDC. He said he expected to see lots of VR games appear in time for Christmas, which would boost sales.  In addition, said the research, there was growing interest in augmented-reality systems, such as Microsoft's HoloLens headset, that use a transparent display to overlay images and information on what people see. Few of these systems were ready for mainstream use, it added.  However, said IDC, screenless systems such as Samsung's Gear VR would be more popular than the tethered headsets.  These require a smartphone capable of handling the high-quality video used for VR and which possess sensors that can monitor movement and adjust what a user sees to give the impression of immersion in a computer-generated scene.  It said it expected other firms to release screenless viewers later this year to accelerate take-up.  By 2020, shipments of VR headsets should hit 64.8 million a year, it predicted.  IDC said headsets that lack electronics, such as Google's Cardboard viewer, were not included in its estimates.  The figures from IDC stand in contrast to those produced by analyst firm Gartner, which predicted that only 1.4 million VR headsets would ship in 2016.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36104161	Reduce £775m bill for temporary Whitehall staff, MPs say	The bill for temporary staff used by the government has nearly doubled in three years, MPs have said.  Whitehall spending on temporary staff rose to £775m in 2014-15, the Public Accounts Committee said.  Chairman Meg Hillier urged ministers to "get a grip" and develop skills among the existing workforce.  The Cabinet Office said it had "stamped out excessive spending" and had more than halved costs from 2009-10, when it peaked at £2.7bn.  But Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said the Cabinet Office's recruitment policy was wasting taxpayers' money,  "We've got a government that claims to spend taxpayers' money wisely but wastes huge amounts of cash on temporary workers, some of whom are paid a thousand pounds a day," said Mr Watson.  "The amount the government spends on short term staff is rising significantly because it isn't recruiting civil servants with the right skills. Poor planning by the cabinet office is costing UK taxpayers dear."  The Public Accounts Committee report also found that 32 people on temporary contracts were paid more than £1,000 a day, although it said that represented a reduction.  The cost of temporary workers was up to between £679m and £775m in 2014-15 - depending on what data was used. This reached up to £1.3bn when coupled with consultants.  The cross-party committee, which scrutinises public spending, said specialist temporary staff often cost twice as much as permanent staff and suggested the government address "the skills gap across government".  The committee said the use of temporary staff was "justified only when it is not feasible for departments to maintain the necessary skills in-house or to borrow those skills from elsewhere within the civil service".  Although spending controls brought in during 2010 had had an effect, spending had been on the rise again since 2011-12, they said.  Central procurement deals were also not used for around half of consultancy and temporary staff assignments, they said.  The committee's Labour chair, Meg Hillier, said public money was being "wasted because of poor workforce planning".  "There is a place for buying in expert advice and using temporary staff if there is a skills gap but departments first need to be sure they do not have access to these skills in-house. Getting this wrong costs the taxpayer dear.  "Filling permanent roles with temporary staff is short-sighted and does nothing to address underlying skills shortages in the civil service, nor to develop its expertise. When temps leave, valuable experience leaves with them.  "The government needs to get a grip, identify where skills are lacking in-house and put a proper plan in place to deliver those skills through the recruitment and development of high quality, permanent staff."  But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: "This government is scrutinising spend like never before. We've stamped out excessive spending on consultants and put in place stringent spending controls. The total spend on consultants is still less than half of that in 2009-10."  He said the department was "actively building" skills but sometimes needed specialist expertise quickly on complex projects.  "But we only do this when the key skills are not readily available within the Civil Service and where it delivers better value for taxpayers," he added.	politics

The figure was calculated based on comments by FBI director James Comey, who said that the agency had paid more to get into the phone than he "will make in the remaining seven years" in his post.  That would make it the largest publicised fee for a hacking job.  Mr Comey added that it was "worth it".  The calculation was based on a projection of Mr Comey's annual salary which, in January 2015, was $183,300. This has been multiplied over the next seven years and four months that he remains in his job. The figure does not factor in pay rises or bonuses.  The FBI has never named the security firm or group of hackers that helped unlock the phone, but whoever it was provided either software or hardware that helped crack the four-digit identification number without triggering a security feature that would have erased all data after 10 incorrect guesses.  Mr Comey said that the same method could be used on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software.  According to research firm IHS Technology, there are about 16 million such phones in use in the US and more than 80% of them run iOS 9 software, according to Apple.  The case has been hugely controversial, largely because of the spat with Apple, which had been resisting a court order requiring it to write new software to allow officials to access Syed Rizwan Farook's phone.  Farook and his wife killed 14 in San Bernardino, California, in December. Both were shot dead by police.  The FBI argued that it needed access to the phone's data to determine if the attackers worked with or were supported by other people and were planning other targets.  It is unclear how much information has been gleaned since the phone was opened. Some US news outlets have reported that, so far, the FBI has not found anything of interest on the device.  The case has raised the debate over whether technology firms' use of encryption is a good thing for consumer privacy or damaging to public safety.  There is big money to be made from helping the authorities to find bugs in software.  Last year, Zerodium - a firm that negotiates bug bounties - offered $1m for a web-based exploit against iOS 9 and that bounty was subsequently claimed.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36110421	$10 router blamed in Bangladesh bank hack	Hackers managed to steal $80m (£56m) from Bangladesh's central bank because it skimped on network hardware and security software, reports Reuters.  The bank had no firewall and used second-hand routers that cost $10 to connect to global financial networks.  Better security and hardware would have hampered the attackers, Reuters said, quoting an official investigator.  The hackers aimed to steal $1bn but made mistakes that led to the theft being spotted and stopped.  A firewall would have made attempts to hack the bank more "difficult", Mohammad Shah Alam, a forensic investigator who works on the Bangladesh team investigating the theft, told Reuters.  The second-hand hardware also meant that basic security steps to segregate network traffic were not taken, he said.  The cheap routers have hindered the investigation, said Mr Alam, because they collected very little network data that could be used to pinpoint the hackers and shed light on their tactics.  The hack took place in early February and involved hackers getting access to the core network of Bangladesh's central bank. They used this privileged access to transfer cash from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to other banks.  A spelling mistake in one of the transfer orders alerted bank staff and meant the hackers only managed to steal $81m. This has been traced to accounts in the Philippines and to casinos in the same country. Most of the cash has yet to be recovered.  Bank security experts said the bank should have spent more time and money protecting the network for its central bank.  "You are talking about an organisation that has access to billions of dollars and they are not taking even the most basic security precautions," Jeff Wichman, a consultant with cyber firm Optiv, told Reuters.	tech

Drivers had argued that they should be classed as employees, entitling them to claim expenses and other rights.  The decision to settle will come as a relief to Uber and others in the on-demand economy who use contractors.  But critics will be disappointed the case is not going to trial.  In a blog post, Uber boss Travis Kalanick said he was pleased with the settlement.  "Drivers value their independence - the freedom to push a button rather than punch a clock, to use Uber and Lyft simultaneously, to drive most of the week or for just a few hours," he said.  But he acknowledged: "We haven't always done a good job working with drivers.  Uber has agreed to some changes in its business practices, including a better policy explaining why it was terminating drivers' contracts.  It also said that it would help create a drivers' association in California and Massachusetts - where the actions were brought - that would act in a similar way to a union and be able to bring grievances to management's attention.  Some 450,000 drivers use the Uber app each month in the US, according to Uber.  One of the lawyers for the drivers, Shannon Liss-Riordan, said there would be disappointment that the case was not now going to trial but added that there was a "significant risk of losing" if the case moved forward.  This is partly because a federal appeals court had recently agreed to review an order allowing Uber drivers to sue as a group.  The settlement does not prevent future court, or US labour bodies, classing Uber drivers as employees, Ms Liss-Riordan added.  Out of the $100m proposed payment, $84m will go to drivers.  The deal must now be approved by US District Judge Edward Chen in San Francisco.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36102709	UK to take thousands of child refugees	The UK will take in up to 3,000 refugees, mostly vulnerable children, from the war-torn Syria region by 2020.  The government called the move the "largest resettlement programme for children in the world".  It is in addition to UK prime minister David Cameron's pledge to take 20,000 refugees by 2020.  But critics said it would do nothing to help the thousands of lone refugee children who had made it to Europe, but were at risk of trafficking and abuse.  The government scheme will target unaccompanied children in the Middle East and North Africa, as well as those considered at risk of abuse and exploitation, such as children threatened with child labour and child marriage. It will resettle children and their families "where the UNHCR deems resettlement is in the best interests of the child."  Several hundred people are expected to be resettled in the UK by April 2017 "with a view to resettling up to 3,000 over the lifetime of this Parliament", the government said.  The five-year Syrian civil war has created more than 4.5 million refugees across the region - half of them children in need of food, education and a home. The UN has warned that a whole generation of Syrian children is at risk.  Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said: "We have always been clear that the vast majority of vulnerable children are better off remaining in host countries in the region so they can be reunited with surviving family members. However, there are exceptional circumstances in which it is in a child's best interests to be resettled in the UK.  "We have engaged with a number of NGOs, including the UNHCR on the best way to provide protection to refugee children and ensure their welfare and safety remain at the heart of every decision made."  The scheme will be reviewed after two years.  The announcement was welcomed by Children's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, who said the children would get the "vital protection and support they need" in the UK.  But Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of Labour's Refugee Taskforce, said the announcement included "nothing new to help the thousands of child refugees alone in Europe who are at risk of trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse".  "Children are risking their lives every day making dangerous journeys, and Europol estimate at least 10,000 children have disappeared in the crisis, many trafficked into prostitution and modern slavery. Many children are sleeping rough or in makeshift camps because children's homes are full, and many have been sexually abused and exploited too."  And Lib Dem leader Tim Farron suggested that the move was a "cynical" ploy - a bid to "buy off" Conservative backbenchers ahead of a Commons vote on the issue of unaccompanied children in the camps next week.  He told the BBC the announcement would not help the 30,000 unaccompanied children who have made it to Europe already but are at risks in camps: "Of those 30,000, 10,000 have gone missing. David Cameron has the ability, should he wish to do so, to step in and prevent these children who are go missing into the hands of child sexual exploiters, human traffickers... And yet once again he's failed to take the opportunity."  And Labour's Lord Dubs, who moved the amendment to the Immigration Bill calling on the government to take in 3,000 child refugees already in Europe, said: "While I welcome this proposal, it doesn't deal sufficiently with the substance of my amendment."  "You also have to wonder whether the use of the 3,000 figure is a deliberate ploy to muddy the debate."  The government has already committed to resettle another 20,000 Syrian refugees under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme, 1,000 of whom have already arrived, including more than 500 children.	politics

Linda Katehi admitted that UC Davis, California, brought in a company "specialising in what is known as search engine optimisation".  But she denied that the institution had sought to "rewrite history".  Ms Katehi has faced calls to resign over the 2011 incident and its fallout.  Earlier this month, the Sacramento Bee newspaper reported that UC Davis hired the PR firm Nevins and Associates on a six-month contract at $15,000 (£10,400) per month.  The university was seeking to deal with the reaction to the incident in 2011 in which students who were protesting on the university's campus, near Sacramento, in California, were pepper-sprayed by a campus police officer.  The paper published a document which it said set out the firm's proposed strategy. The document read: "Nevins and Associates is prepared to create and execute an online branding campaign designed to clean up the negative attention the University of California, Davis, and Chancellor Katehi have received related to the events that transpired in November 2011."  The document also referred to "eradication of references to the pepper spray incident in search results on Google for the university and the Chancellor" via an "aggressive and comprehensive online campaign to eliminate the negative search results".  In a statement published on the university's website this week, Ms Katehi said: "In hindsight, we should have been more careful in reviewing some of the more unrealistic and ridiculous scope-of-work claims in the written proposals of our outside vendors.  "What might be accepted industry hyperbole in the private public relations world falls far beneath the high standards of a public institution of higher learning."  The Los Angeles Times reported last week that the University of California's student association had called on Ms Katehi to resign over the news.  In her statement, Ms Katehi acknowledged that an extra $1.6m (£1.1m) had been pumped into the institution's communications budget recently. She cited examples of the university's good works and said that any organisation in its position would seek to ensure those were highlighted.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36102710	UK to step up pressure over IS 'genocide' after MPs' vote	The UK government has promised to step up pressure for official recognition of atrocities committed by so-called Islamic State as acts of genocide.  It follows a unanimous Commons vote condemning the persecution of Christians and Yazidis.  Tory MPs defied orders to abstain in the vote, which is one of the few times actions have been declared genocide in a war that is still going on.  The Foreign Office said the debate had "clarified" its position.  The MPs want the UK government to make an immediate referral to the UN Security Council with a view to giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction. They say this will enable the perpetrators to be brought to justice.  Foreign Office minister Tobias Ellwood told MPs he personally believed what was happening in Iraq and Syria was genocide but added: "This ultimately is a matter for courts to decide. It is not for governments to be the prosecutor, the judge or indeed jury."  He said so-called Islamic State - also known as Daesh - would be "held to account for its barbaric crimes against the majorities and minorities involved - Shi'a and Sunni Muslims, Christians, Yazidis, Kurds and other groups" by being defeated and exposed as a "failing organisation"​.  He said efforts to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court, in 2014, had been vetoed by Russia and China and any fresh resolution "could very well be blocked again".  But he said "further discussions are taking place", adding: "We are now in a different place from where we were in 2014."  Foreign Office sources said the Commons debate had helped "clarify" the government's position and it would raise the issue of genocide with its partners on the UN Security Council, but it did not want to act unilaterally as this would not have the desired effect.  Crossbench peer Lord Alton sought to keep pressure on the government following Wednesday's debate, telling peers the government risked being in contempt of Parliament if it ignored the vote as "non-binding".  Foreign Office minister Baroness Anelay of St Johns replied that the government would do "everything it can to gather evidence for judicial bodies" but it wanted to be "sure of getting a result" in the Security Council.  Conservative MP Fiona Bruce, who tabled Wednesday's Commons motion, told MPs: "Genocide is a word of such gravity that it should never be used readily. It is rightly known as the crime above all crimes.  "For this reason it is incumbent upon us to prevent the term from devaluation or overuse. But such caution must not stop us from naming a genocide when one is taking place."  She told how MPs had heard the "truly harrowing" personal testimony of a brave 16-year-old Yazidi girl, who was seized along with others from her community by Islamic State fighters, witnessing her father and brother killed in front of her.  She said Yazidis and Christians had been targeted explicitly because of their religion and ethnicity.  "Recognising the actions of Daesh as genocide should therefore help inject further momentum into the international efforts to stop the killings," she added.  "It would hopefully lead to more active safeguarding of those members of religious minorities on the ground whose lives and very communities currently hang in the balance.  "It may also make new recruits including those from the UK think twice about joining given the ramifications of being caught."  Conservative MP David Burrowes said MPs would not stop until the government was held to account over its response to the atrocities.  "We will return, again and again until the government properly make that justifiable referral to the Security Council."  Fellow Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said the government should not hide behind legal precedent as a reason not to act.	politics

Opening a special "Humble Address", the PM said she had led a "gentle evolution" of the monarchy during her 64-year reign.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said whatever people's views on the monarchy, the "vast majority" agreed she had served her country.  Crowds lined the streets in Windsor as the monarch took part in a walkabout, after royal gun salutes were fired from each of the UK's capital cities.  Mr Cameron paid tribute to her "extraordinary service", which he said was "a joy for us all to celebrate, to cherish and to honour".  He added: "In this modern Elizabethan era, Her Majesty has led a gentle evolution of our monarchy.  "From that first televised Christmas Day message, over three decades before cameras were allowed into this House, to the opening up of the royal palaces and the invention of the royal walkabout, she's brought the monarchy closer to the people while also retaining its dignity."  Praising her international diplomacy, the PM said that after a visit to Balmoral, the Queen could claim to be the only woman to have ever driven the King of Saudi Arabia around in a car.  Mr Corbyn, who has said he is a Republican "at heart" but is not interested in trying to replace the monarchy, offered the Queen his "warmest greetings" and said he was "fully in favour of our country having leaders of a finer vintage".  "Today we're talking about a highly respected individual who is 90 - and whatever different views people across this country have about the institution, the vast majority share an opinion that Her Majesty has served this country and has overwhelming support with a clear sense of public service and public duty," he said, before joking that she may be, like him, an Arsenal fan.  Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, highlighted the Queen's "enduring and special" relationship with Scotland, and recalled her opening of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 "after a recess of nearly 300 years".  "I'd like to take the opportunity to put on record the appreciation of people in Scotland to Her Majesty, who has had a lifetime connection with and a commitment to the country," he said.  Liberal Democrat Leader Tim Farron she had provided "immeasurable constancy" during a time of great upheaval.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19504639	Q&A: Police and crime commissioners	Elections for police and crime commissioners will take place across most of England and Wales on 5 May. Here is a guide to what PCCs do and how the system, introduced in 2012, works.  PCCs are elected representatives who work to ensure police forces in England and Wales are running effectively. They replaced police authorities in 2012 and were intended to bring a public voice to policing.  The government insists PCCs are not there to run local police forces but to hold them to account and respond to the needs of the public.  There is no PCC in London because the mayor is responsible for policing.  In the first PCC elections held in November 2012, 192 candidates stood for the 41 posts covering England and Wales.  Sixteen Conservative PCCs were elected, 13 from Labour and 12 Independents. Among the successful independent candidates were eight former police officers, one of Wales' most senior barristers, and an ex-pilot. Six women were elected (from 35 who stood as candidates) and 35 men.  In this year's election on 5 May there are 40 votes being held - because Greater Manchester is not holding an election. The region is set to vote for the new post of elected mayor in 2017 and the powers and responsibilities of the PCC will fall to the mayor. Since last May PCC Tony Lloyd, who was elected in 2012, has held the post of interim mayor.  This time there are 188 candidates standing. Labour and the Conservatives are fielding candidates in each area, with UKIP putting forward 34 candidates and the Liberal Democrats 30. Of those elected in 2012, 26 are standing again, as are two successful candidates from by-elections held in 2014.  Police and crime commissioners cannot tell the police how to do their job - despite having some control over the direction of a force. The operational independence of the police is protected by legislation.  New measures proposed in the Policing and Crime Bill, which is currently passing through Parliament, would enable PCCs to take on responsibility for fire and rescue services. The Home Office said it wanted to encourage more "efficiency and effectiveness" but the Fire Brigades Union called the idea "dangerous" and a "half-baked suggestion" and the Local Government Association said it saw no "pressing need" for the change.  Public elections for the first police and crime commissioners took place on 15 November 2012 in 41 police force areas across England and Wales, not including London. The elections - 37 in England and four in Wales - were described as the biggest shake-up of policing for almost 50 years but the turnout was the lowest in peacetime Britain. One polling station in Newport, Gwent, was visited by no voters at all.  Fewer than 15% of voters turned out in the 41 police areas electing a PCC, prompting the Electoral Commission to hold a review into how the polls were conducted. The inquiry found 80% of voters felt they did not have enough information to make an informed choice. The commission's chairwoman Jenny Watson said: "The government took a number of decisions about how to run these elections that we did not agree with."  All registered voters are entitled to take part in the elections. The supplementary vote system is used in all force areas where more than two candidates stand, with voters marking the ballot paper with their first and second choice of candidate. In the 2016 elections there are at least three candidates standing for each post.  A PCC's term of office is four years, with a maximum of two terms.  The idea of giving local people more of a say in how the police in their area are run had been championed for years by some Conservatives as a way of boosting local democracy - but it only became party policy at the 2010 general election.  The coalition agreement published after the May 2010 election contained a pledge to make the police "more accountable through oversight by a directly elected individual". The proposal was fleshed out in the white paper "Policing in the 21st Century" and enacted in the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act, which became law in 2011.  London has a directly elected mayor, who acts as the police and crime commissioner for the Metropolitan police area. London's police and crime panel is formed from a committee of elected London Assembly members. The commissioner of the Metropolitan Police continues to be a Royal appointment on the advice of the home secretary.  In 2014 Chancellor George Osborne announced plans for an elected mayor for Greater Manchester as part of a project to hand more devolved power to the north.  Manchester's PCC Tony Lloyd became the city's interim mayor in May 2015, retaining the PCC responsibilities when he transferred to his new role. Mancunians will vote for an elected mayor for the first time in 2017 and, as in London, the mayor will continue to oversee policing.  PCCs are required to swear an oath of impartiality when they are elected to office. This echoes the commitment police officers make to serve every member of the public impartially. Before the introduction of PCCs, the government promised the way investigations were carried out would not become political.  PCCs have to answer to the public - the government has said their performance "should be judged solely by the electorate" - and more than two-thirds of the commissioners are asking voters to re-elect them in 2016.  And people can complain to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) if they think their PCC has broken the law.  In addition to this, Police and Crime Panels were set up in each force area to scrutinise and challenge the actions and decisions of each PCC. A panel may require the attendance of the PCC, has the power to suspend them from office because of a criminal offence, or exercise a veto over a proposed candidate for chief constable.  But in July 2013, less than a year into the new system, the Home Affairs Select Committee said it seemed "very easy" for a PCC to remove a chief constable for "insubstantial" reasons and advised police and crime panels should be more vigorous in analysing contentious decisions by PCCs, such as the sacking of a chief constable.  In England, panels are mainly made up of representatives from each local authority in a police force area. In Wales, they are free-standing public bodies, set up and maintained by the secretary of state, rather than local authority committees.  When the role was introduced, ministers insisted the cost of PCCs and police and crime panels must be no greater than the abolished police authorities.  In 2013, BBC research revealed the salaries of the majority of the PCCs were between £70,000 and £85,000, although the commissioners overseeing the three major forces of Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and West Midlands were each receiving £100,000. It was also calculated that PCCs across England and Wales had employed at least 449 people in the six months after their introduction.  Salaries are recommended by the Senior Salaries Review Body, which advises on the remuneration of those in public office, and approved by the home secretary.  During the first year PCCs were in office, there were four investigations carried out by the IPCC, as well as investigations by the CPS into expenses claims. And MPs on the Home Affairs Committee warned ministers were failing to properly monitor the salaries and standards of PCCs.  In 2014, South Yorkshire's PCC Shaun Wright resigned over the Rotherham child abuse scandal. He had faced demands to step down in the wake of a report that found at least 1,400 children were abused in the town from 1997 to 2013. Mr Wright, who had been the head of children's services in Rotherham between 2005 and 2010, eventually said he was stepping down as PCC to ensure the "important issues" outlined in the report could be discussed and considered "without distraction".  Home Secretary Theresa May had called for Mr Wright to stand down and - in the few days before he did so - the controversy prompted then Deputy Prime Minister and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, whose party helped pass the legislation that created PCCs, to describe the role as a "discredited experiment" and say PCCs should be abolished.  Just three months after being elected Lincolnshire PCC Alan Hardwick suspended his temporary chief constable Neil Rhodes over an employment dispute. But a judicial review into the suspension ruled in favour of Mr Rhodes, with a judge calling the suspension "irrational and perverse", and he was reinstated. The row also saw the chairman of the crime panel stand down. Speaking at the time, Mr Hardwick, who is not standing for re-election, said he accepted the judge's decision and added: "The rules governing PCCs don't really envisage this sort of thing, there is more guidance needed."  Kent PCC Ann Barnes, an Independent, has been a controversial figure during her tenure and announced in March she would not be standing for re-election. A report last year found she may not have been properly insured when she was in a car crash and she was criticised for taking part in a documentary and for her appointments of youth commissioners. In a statement on her website when she said she would not be standing in the 2016 election, Ms Barnes said the people of Kent had been getting a better service and added: "I am content that I have delivered what I said I would."  Cumbria's PCC, Richard Rhodes, apologised for using a chauffeur-driven car that cost £700 of taxpayers' money for just two trips and admitted he had failed to check how much it would cost. The former head teacher paid the money back and said at the time he understood the public concern over the case. Cumbria Police arrested three people in connection with leaking the information but no charges were brought. Mr Rhodes is not standing for re-election.  When he was just over six months into the role Bob Jones, the West Midlands PCC, said PCCs should be scrapped and replaced with something more efficient and less party political. Mr Jones died in July 2014 aged 59 and a by-election was held to replace him the following month. The turnout for the by-election was just 10.4% - lower than the 12% in the West Midlands in 2012 - and the cost of the poll was estimated at £3.7m, nearly £20 for every vote cast.  Supporters argue that elected commissioners make policing more accountable and responsive to local needs because, for example, they consult with victims of crime when setting policing priorities. They also say PCCs bring valuable outside experience to forces.  Home secretary Theresa May, who introduced the role, says PCCs "have engaged with the public over the past three-and-a-half years in ways that police authorities never did or could".  In 2012 opponents warned PCCs could lead to the politicisation of the police, with commissioners favouring headline-grabbing initiatives. They also feared commissioners could interfere with the running of police forces.  Critics have also questioned whether PCCs have real legitimacy following the low turnout of just over 15% in the 2012 elections.  Police authorities, first established in 1964 to hold chief constables to account, had oversight of the police before PCCs. They were made up of local councillors and independent, appointed members. But the coalition government concluded police authorities were "invisible" and needed replacing with elected commissioners and police and crime panels.	politics

The Culture Secretary has faced calls to withdraw from press regulation decisions after news of his relationship with an escort.  He said politicians must "tread very carefully" on press regulation.  He also said the government had an "open mind" on implementing the rest of the Leveson review into the press.  Making his first Commons appearance since the story broke, Mr Whittingdale said he had "considerable sympathy with the victims of press abuse" and that he'd had a number of meetings with some of them.  Backbench MP Simon Danczuk accused him of breaking the prime minister's promise to implement the 2011 inquiry in full.  "Having had my faith perhaps tested to the utmost I still believe that press freedom is a vitally important component of a free society and we should tread very carefully," Mr Whittingdale said.  Campaigners are calling for outstanding parts of the Leveson review - which would require newspapers to pay libel costs even if they won a case brought against them - to be implemented.  Mr Whittingdale said the government was "keeping an open mind about when to implement the remaining section", acknowledging a decision was needed "relatively quickly".  He also added that cost provision for victims could not come into effect until there was a "recognised regulator" in place.  Mr Whittingdale's opposite number, Labour's shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle joked that he had been distracted by "extra curricular activities" - adding that she was referring to his "moonlighting for the Leave campaign" ahead of the EU referendum.	politics

Russian Aleksandr Andreevich Panin has been sentenced to nine-and-a-half years in jail. His accomplice, Algerian Hamza Bendelladj, will serve 15 years.  They created the SpyEye virus package that is believed to have infected more than 50 million computers.  The sophisticated malware could steal sensitive data or let hackers use infected machines to send spam.  The pair used SpyEye themselves but also offered it as a malware "kit" to anyone willing to pay for it, said the US Department of Justice (DoJ). The most sophisticated version of SpyEye cost about $10,000.  Once large numbers of PCs were infected with SpyEye, the pair ran tools that siphoned off cash and also helped the malware spread further.  Cleaning up the damage caused by SpyEye from 2010 to 2012 is believed to have cost banks around the world more than $1bn, said the DoJ.  "It is difficult to overstate the significance of this case, not only in terms of bringing two prolific computer hackers to justice, but also in disrupting and preventing immeasurable financial losses to individuals and the financial industry around the world," said US attorney John Horn in a statement.  "The sentences that were imposed reflect the magnitude of the harm," said Mr Horn.  Panin, known as "Gribodemon" and "Harderman" online, pleaded guilty to bank and wire fraud charges in January 2014 after reaching a deal with prosecutors.  "I want everyone in this courtroom to understand my actions were inexcusable and inexplicable," said Panin at the sentencing hearing. Panin was arrested in 2013 as he passed through Atlanta, Georgia on an international flight.  Bendelladj, known as Bx1 online, also pleaded guilty but has not reached a deal with prosecutors. His lawyer said he planned to appeal.  Bendelladj was arrested in Bangkok, Thailand in early 2013 while changing planes and was extradited to the US shortly afterwards.  Panin and Bendelladj were "legends" in the criminal underworld, said Mr Grimberg, adding that the sentences would send a message to other cybercriminals.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36094112	Nato spending target 'met by MoD accounting changes'	A government pledge to spend 2% of GDP on defence is only being met through accounting changes, MPs have claimed.  Chancellor George Osborne last year said the UK would continue to meet the target, set by Nato for member nations.  But the cross-party Defence Committee said that including what is spent on intelligence gathering and war pensions could be seen as "creative accounting".  Labour said that amounted to "fiddling the books" but the Ministry of Defence said it was all within Nato guidelines.  The UK has met the 2% target consistently over the past decade, one of the few Nato members to do so, although spending on defence as a share of GDP has steadily fallen over the past 30 years.  The government is facing claims that it had to include measures such as intelligence gathering and war pensions - which were not previously counted as defence spending - in order to make the figures add up.  The cross-party committee warned that this "redefinition" to some degree undermined the government's claims that the 2% figure represented a significant increase in defence spending.  "We note that the Nato minimum would not have been fulfilled if UK accounting practices had not been modified, albeit in ways permitted by Nato guidelines," it said.  "The only way that the Ministry of Defence can refute claims of 'creative accounting' is to outline, clearly and unambiguously, what the new inclusions are, how much they constitute, and from which department each was previously funded."  Last year with much fanfare - and after strong pressure from the US - the government announced it would continue to meet Nato's target of spending 2% of the nation's wealth on defence.  While this report stops short of accusing the government of fiddling the books to meet that goal, it does say ministers are open to the charge of creative accounting.  The MPs say deciphering the MoD's accounts has not been easy. But they confirm that items previously not defined as defence spending - such as war pensions and some intelligence gathering - are now being included to achieve the 2% pledge.  The Defence Committee says the government needs to be clear about what counts as defence spending and also how it will continue meeting the goal in the coming years.  The committee also called on ministers to explain how they would continue to meet the 2% target up to 2020 given the pressures from public sector pay and fact that this year's total included a number of one-off items which would not be repeated in future years.  "We remain to be convinced that the current financial settlement is sufficient to rectify the decline of defence as a national priority," it said.  "The government must be clear that 2% is a minimum - not a target - and be prepared to increase defence expenditure further in order to reflect the increasing threats faced by both the UK and our allies."  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, committee chairman Julian Lewis said the government should have "flagged" that it was including categories of expenditure not previously counted - saying it was "trying to amass every last little bit...in order to scrape over the 2% threshold".  Labour has seized on the committee's report, accusing the government of sharp practice.  "After the crippling cuts to the armed forces imposed by the Tories throughout the last parliament, we were promised that 2015 would mark a turning point," said shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry.  "Instead, it's increasingly clear that the 2% commitment is being delivered not through increases in frontline defence spending but by fiddling the books.  "Time and again on defence, the Tories are shown to be all rhetoric and no reality, and it is our armed forces who are paying the price."  But the Ministry of Defence said this was "nonsense" and the UK's military would enjoy a big increase in resources over the next four years.  "When defence spending will increase by £5bn over this parliament, it is nonsense to suggest there is no new funding," a spokesman said.  "Our plans will deliver more ships, more planes, more troops at readiness, better equipment for special forces, and more on cyber to help keep Britain safe."	politics

The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) was given more powers in 2014 to actively search for such images and take action.  The content it found included images and videos of 1,788 victims who were assessed as being aged two or under.  Just 0.2% of child sexual abuse imagery is hosted in the UK, the charity said.  Reporting on its work in 2015, the IWF said:  IWF chief executive Susie Hargreaves said: "Last year our analysts broke all records for assessing reports. By being allowed to actively search for these hideous images of children, we've seen a dramatic increase in the sheer number of illegal images and videos that we've been able to remove from the internet.  "But despite our success, this isn't the time to stand still. What we never forget is that behind these headlines and every single image we remove from the internet there is a real child being abused."  In 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron granted the IWF powers to actively search for images of child sexual abuse rather than just rely on reports from members of the public.  The charity plans to expand its team of 12 analysts to 17 and offer its image list, identified by unique "hash" codes, to the wider internet industry so internet service providers and other content companies can take down duplicate images.  It is also planning to challenge online companies that are not members of the IWF to take action.  "There is simply no excuse. Not being part of this battle to eliminate online child sexual abuse imagery, is not an option," said Ms Hargreaves.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36098271	Spies' 'staggering' data requests revealed	Since 2005 successive Home Secretaries have authorised the collection of vast amounts of telecommunications data, documents reveal.  The documents also show that MI5 secretly collected large amounts of "anonymised" financial data.  Campaign group Privacy International said the documents show "the staggering extent of UK government surveillance".  The Home Office said the data acquisition had "been essential to the security and intelligence agencies".  It added that the data had provided "vital and unique intelligence".  The disclosure of the documents was made to Privacy International as it prepares for an Investigatory Powers Tribunal hearing in July.  The tribunal handles complaints against UK intelligence agencies MI5, MI6 and GCHQ.  The campaign group is challenging the agencies use and acquisition of "bulk personal datasets" - very large amounts of personal data collected from public and private organisations.  The Home Office has repeatedly refused to list the datasets the agencies hold, but the documents show the agencies could request a range of sensitive information, including medical information, financial information, and information about telephone and internet communications.  The documents reveal that among other things this data is vital in identifying "foreign fighters", possibly a reference to jihadists involved in the conflict in Syria and Iraq.  Privacy International said: "The intelligence agencies have secretly given themselves access to potentially any and all recorded information about us".  But the Home Office told the BBC: "The acquisition and use of bulk [data] provides vital and unique intelligence", adding: "The security and intelligence agencies use the same techniques that modern businesses increasingly rely on to analyse data in order to overcome the most significant national security challenges".  In several documents the risk that the public might become aware of the powers is discussed.  An MI5 policy issued in 2010 says the agency's access to "anonymised" financial data would be against "public expectations".  It says that if the data is revealed the media response could be "unfavourable and probably inaccurate".  David Davis MP, a former Conservative Shadow Home Secretary, told the BBC: "It's clear the agencies and the government have been keeping information secret about what they've been doing not just for security reasons, as is normally claimed, but to avoid both embarrassment and public opposition."  Every six months since 21 July 2005, Home Secretaries have authorised MI5 to collect in a database, information from communication network providers, the documents reveal.  This could include telephone data and internet data. It does not include the content of communications.  The documents say the data is anonymous as it does not contain "subscriber information", but privacy campaigners argue it would be possible work out the identity of an individual from the data.  MI5 says the data is deleted every 12 months. In the documents the data is said to be of "significant security value."  The data is obtained under Section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984. The government's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson QC, has previously told the BBC the legislation was "so vague that anything could be done under it".  But requests to use the database, the documents say, require a separate authorisation under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.  The documents set out detailed procedures required to authorise the collection and use of the data.  But they reveal that misuse has occurred.  One document produced by MI6 gives examples of "individual users crossing the line" for example, "looking up addresses in order to send birthday cards" and "checking details of family members for personal reasons"  The revelations will add to the controversy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Bill currently working its way through parliament.  Millie Graham Wood of Privacy International said: "The agencies have been doing this for 15 years in secret and are now quietly trying to put these powers on the statute book for the first time."  But the Home Office said the new law is necessary and will strengthen safeguards, telling the BBC that the Bill "will also establish the Investigatory Powers Commissioner who will keep under review the use of bulk personal datasets by the intelligence agencies."  That is currently done by the Intelligence Services Commissioner, who confirmed in his 2014 report that "the case for holding BPD has been established in each service" and "agencies all have strict procedures in place in relation to handling, retention and deletion."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36094111	Conservatives admit 2015 election expenses 'error'	The Conservatives have admitted failing to declare £38,000 of general election expenses.  The party blamed an "administrative error" for failing to register the accommodation costs of activists involved in the Battlebus 2015 operation.  A Conservative spokesman said the party had already brought the error to the attention of the Electoral Commission.  The Tories insisted the Battlebus operation was part of the national campaign organised by Conservative Campaign HQ and, as such, the expenditure did not form part of the spending by individual candidates.  But Channel 4 said its investigation suggested the operation was focused at a local level, so should have been declared as such.  An Electoral Commission spokeswoman said: "The commission is currently conducting an investigation into the Conservative Party's 2015 General Election spending return and will consider carefully any new allegations that are raised as part of the Channel 4 news programme.  "In line with the commission's enforcement policy, the commission does not comment on ongoing investigations, as to do so may hinder the conduct of the investigation."  The Conservative Party issued a statement saying its activists were campaigning "across the country for the return of a Conservative government" and, as such, their activities were regarded as national not local expenditure.  "As is apparent from our national return, the party declared expenditure related to our CCHQ-organised Battlebus," it said.  "However, due to administrative error it omitted to declare the accommodation costs of those using the vehicles. This is something we have already brought to the attention of the Electoral Commission in order to amend the return."  "The party always took the view that our national Battlebus, a highly-publicised campaign activity, was part of the national return - and we would have no reason not to declare it as such, given that the party was some millions below the national spending threshold. Other political parties ran similar vehicles which visited different parliamentary constituencies as part of their national campaigning."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36097461	Xbox 360 games console discontinued by Microsoft	Microsoft has said it is to stop manufacturing the XBox 360 games console, 10 years after it launched.  In a blog post, Xbox boss Phil Spencer said gamers had completed more than 78 billion hours of play on the devices.  Last year the firm enabled Xbox 360 games to work on its successor, the Xbox One.  Mr Spencer said all remaining Xbox 360 consoles would still be sold, and the platform would continue to be supported for existing users.  "I am incredibly proud of all of the work and dedication that went into development of the Xbox 360 hardware, services and games portfolio over the last decade. And I'm grateful to the fans for their continued passion and support," he wrote.  "While we've had an amazing run, the realities of manufacturing a product over a decade old are starting to creep up on us."  I don't think anyone will see this as an unexpected move by Microsoft - you could almost say it's about time they pulled the plug.  There are a lot of very good games out there made for the XBox 360 but it is a 10-year-old device.  All these things have a moment in the sun and the Xbox 360 had longer than most - it was certainly around for a lot longer than the original Xbox.  It's not like the ZX Spectrum or the Commodore 64 - there is a nostalgia value to that but when you sit down with a 360 version of a current generation game you can see the difference... and nobody's nostalgic for graphics that are a bit less good.

A Freedom of Information request by the Huffington Post UK found the cost of a journey transporting just government documents had often exceeded £100.  The total bill could be higher as figures for additional trips using pool cars were not available.  The government said there had been a "substantial reduction" in the cost of ministerial cars since 2011.  David Cameron announced plans to shrink the bill for ministerial cars shortly after coming to office in 2010, and the number of ministers with access to their own chauffeur-driven car was cut.  The practice of carrying ministers' "red boxes" in official cars is used for sensitive documentation.  In 2010, journalist Sarah Vine, the wife of the then education secretary Michael Gove, wrote that while her husband could travel home by public transport, his red box would travel separately "in air-conditioned splendour, snug and secure in the back of a locked car".  The red boxes travelled alone using the Government Car Service 1,910 times between 2012-13 and 2014-15, with the number of journeys rising over the course of the three years.  Source: Freedom of Information request to the Department for Transport  Since 2012, pool cars have also been used by departments but their use is not recorded by the DfT, the department said.  Labour MP Graham Jones told the Huffington Post: "The Tories said they'd clamp down on wasteful spending yet they still allow hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to be spent ferrying round briefcases in chauffeur-driven cars."  But the Department for Transport said the total cost of carrying ministers' paperwork was just 5% of the total spent on the Government Car Service‎ and that it was committed to ensuring the service provided value for money.  A spokeswoman added: "That is why, since 2010, the number of cars that make up the service has been reduced from 227 to 78.  "We have also been working hard to cut our operating costs in order to further reduce the cost to the public purse.  "Before April 2012, all cars were part of a government car pool and could be booked separately by ministers. After April 2012, cars were allocated to departments as departmental pool cars for use by ministers. These cars are managed by each department."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36092505	PMQs: Cameron vows to 'finish the job' on academies	David Cameron has defended controversial plans to force all state schools in England to become academies, saying it is time to "finish the job".  During Prime Minister's Questions, Labour's Jeremy Corbyn cited opposition to the "top down reorganisation" from teachers, parents and some Tory MPs.  He said good schools should not be distracted by "arbitrary changes".  Sources said the government was likely to guarantee no small rural schools would close as a result of the shakeup.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has been told ministers are having lots of conversations with Conservative MPs to tackle their concerns - but are not intending to back down on the policy.  Academies, which started under the Labour government, are funded directly by central government and are independent of local authority control.  In March's Budget, the government announced the move to force all of England's state schools that have not yet converted to academies to do so.  Some Conservative MPs have questioned the wisdom of forcing all schools to make the switch, which has has been outlined in a white paper, in particular the impact on small rural schools if academy chains are not willing to take them over.  Conservative backbencher Andrew Percy said it was "a very hard sell" to tell good or outstanding schools they must change their governance arrangements.  "The government needs to do a lot more before it's convinced myself and a lot of backbenchers that forcing academisation is necessary," he added.  The enforced change has also been opposed by teaching unions and the Local Government Association - which said the government had highlighted improvements in the primary sector, where 85% of schools are council-maintained.  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said critics of the proposal have raised "important issues".  Mr Corbyn asked the PM to explain "why good school leaders should focus their time and resources not on educating children but on arbitrary changes imposed from above".  Mr Cameron said schools that were performing well had "nothing to fear" from being converted to academies.  The reform had been "hugely effective" he said, adding: "We have seen massive improvements in our schools because of academies and we say let's get on with it, finish the job and give all our children a great opportunity."  Schools Minister Nick Gibb told BBC News the plan for all schools to become academies by 2022 was about "spreading best practice".  Mr Gibb said this was a "voluntary process" but added that as more schools convert it would not be viable to have two systems of governance "operating in parallel".  Meanwhile, the Department for Education's accounts were criticised by a financial watchdog.  National Audit Office head Amyas Morse said the department had failed to properly account for spending by academies, saying there was not enough accurate information for Parliament to account for the public money.  The NAO said there was a level of "misstatement and uncertainty" which meant the truth and fairness of the accounts, which have just been published, could not be verified.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36094565	Can 'sweaty billboard' help fight Zika virus?	A billboard that attracts and kills mosquitoes has been designed by marketing agencies in Brazil.  The board releases a mixture of a lactic acid solution that mimics the smell of human sweat and carbon dioxide, which is in human breath.  Its inventors have released the blueprint for free and are encouraging people around the world to make them.  However, one expert warned it could attract insects to areas where there are many humans.  The two companies behind the Mosquito Killer Board, Posterscope and NBS, believe it could help in the fight against the Zika virus, which is carried by mosquitoes.  The insects are drawn to the aroma from the board from a distance of up to 2.5km away, the board's inventors say.  They are then trapped inside it and can be seen in the message it bears, which explains its purpose.  So far, they have installed two of the Mosquito Killer Billboards in Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil.  The firms will not be selling the advertising space inside the billboard.  "It's impressive how many mosquitoes you can trap and how many lives you can save with this idea," Otto Frossard from Posterscope told the BBC.  Mr Frossard added that the board would cost "a few thousand Reals" (1000 Brazilian Reals is $192 / £283) to make.  "I think anything that can be done to reduce the prevalence of the mosquito is a good thing," said Dr Chris Jackson, a pest control expert at the University of Southampton.  "Particularly devices like this that attract and kill females that feed on blood, as it is only female mosquitoes that bite," he explained.  Dr Jackson said that, while the science behind the billboard was effective, putting them in public places and attracting human attention - as well as insects - could be a problem.  "I do have a few concerns," he told the BBC.  "Maybe if it was not in a high-density place, where people are sitting perhaps with exposed legs... otherwise, you're pulling in hungry mosquitoes and providing them with exposed human flesh."	tech

The Public Accounts Committee said the UK had shown "agility, bravery and innovation" in helping to contain the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone and deal with famine in the Horn of Africa.  But performance in war zones like Syria and Yemen needs "fuller understanding".  It also urged the UK to take a lead in trying to simplify UN aid structures.  The UK has one of the largest foreign aid budgets in the world and last year became the first G7 country to meet an international commitment to spend 0.7% - about £12bn - of its national income on overseas development.  The government has sought to refocus spending in recent years amid criticism from MPs on the right of the Conservative Party that the foreign aid budget has been protected from cuts since 2010 during a time of prolonged domestic austerity.  Spending on humanitarian emergencies trebled in the four years to 2014-15, the cross-party committee said in its report. The Department for International Development spent £1.28bn dealing with overseas crises - 14% of its £9.5bn budget.  The Department for International Development (DfID), the MPs concluded, was doing a "good job" in responding to more than 20 crises around the world caused by conflict, natural disaster, disease and drought.  It singled out for praise the UK's contribution to fighting the Ebola outbreak, noting that it had quickly mobilised resources to transfer 164 staff from other areas to Sierra Leone - putting some lower priority activities on hold to focus on the crisis.  Other countries in which "tangible results" had been achieved include the Philippines, where a UK team has been helping build resilience against typhoons following the devastation wrought by typhoon Haiyan in 2013.  But while acknowledging that DfID was working in many difficult and dangerous environments, the committee said it did not often know what constituted success in terms of value for money.  While the performance of individual interventions is assessed, the committee said protracted engagements in war zones such as Syria and Yemen were not subject to the same "structured approach" as others, limiting the lessons being learnt.  Among the committee's recommendations are more focus on assessing "longer-running and more complex crises", a review of the use of external contractors, ensuring staff and equipment can always be deployed overseas at short notice, better tracking of how UK funds are spent by other bodies, including UN agencies whose "overlapping remits", the MPs said, can often lead to inefficiency.  "It is important to recognise the Department for International Development has had a positive impact in responding to some desperate situations around the world," said Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who chairs the committee.  "It is also important that, however public money is spent, the government is held to account for that spending.  "In responding to crises, achieving value for money means critical support can be provided more effectively to more of the people who need it. It is vital it looks constantly at the way it spends public money and ensures it is being used to best advantage."  In response, DfID said it welcomed the MPs' recognition "of the success it has had in tackling a range of crises".  "The government's aid strategy places a heavy focus on ensuring value for money, and the UK is playing a lead role in discussions on the future of the international humanitarian system and overseas development, including the role of UN agencies," a spokeswoman added.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35746649	Tomorrow's Buildings: Help! My building has been hacked	In 2013, Google - one of the world's pre-eminent tech companies - was hacked.  It wasn't its search engine that was attacked or its advertising platform or even its social network, Google+. Instead, it was a building.  Two cybersecurity experts hacked into its Wharf 7 office in Sydney, Australia, through Google's building management system (BMS).  One of them, Billy Rios, says: "Me and my colleague have a lot of experience in cybersecurity, but it is not something that people couldn't learn.  "Once you understand how the systems work, it is very simple."  He found the vulnerable systems on Shodan, a search engine that lists devices connected to the internet, and then ran it through his own software to identify who owned the building.  In the case of the Google hack, the researchers had no nefarious purpose, did no damage and informed Google about the vulnerabilities they found.  According to Mr Rios, who runs security company Whitescope, there are 50,000 buildings currently connected to the internet - including research facilities, churches and hospitals, and 2,000 of those are online with no password protection.  "That is 2,000 buildings where you can access systems that heat and cool the building and potentially gain access to the controls of the doors," he says.  Martyn Thomas, a professor of IT at Gresham College in the UK, tells the BBC: "It is beyond doubt that attempts to attack building management systems are happening all the time."  Making a building smart generally means connecting the systems that control heating, lighting and security to the internet and the wider corporate network.  There was a compelling reason for doing this, said Andrew Kelly, principal security consultant at defence company Qinetiq.  "Energy savings are the biggest factor in connecting building management systems to the corporate network," he says.  "It gives those who run the building better control and offers between 20 to 50% in energy savings."  But it also makes them less secure.  There are various scenarios where a hacked building could have dire consequences.  Imagine, for instance, a malicious attack at an old people's home where, in the depth of winter, hackers gain control of the heating system and shut it down.  Or a hospital where hackers take over the lighting or electricity system.  Or thieves who walk into a building they want to rob simply by overriding the system that controls the security.  And if any of these feels like a Hollywood film script, think again.  In 2013, the US Department of Homeland Security revealed hackers had broken into a "state government facility" and made it "unusually warm".  And, in 2014, security consultant Jesus Molina told US cybersecurity conference Black Hat he had been able to gain full control of lighting, temperature and the entertainment system of 200 rooms while staying at the St Regis hotel in the Chinese city of Shenzhen.  Some of the most high-profile attacks in recent years have taken advantage of the vulnerability of building management systems.  An attack on US retailer Target, in which millions of customers' credit card information was stolen, was traced back to the heating and ventilation system.  And, at the beginning of the year, a Ukrainian power station was hacked. Although spear-phishing - where an employee is duped into bringing malware into the system by clicking on an email or link - was blamed as the means of entry, the result was physical - nearly 80,000 customers were left without power.  Mr Kelly tells the BBC: "We have seen plenty of ransomware attacks where computers are encrypted by hackers and only decrypted if the company pays money, and it is very easy to see a scenario of such an attack on a building management system, where a factory or hospital is disabled and hackers request payment.  "It is on the horizon, it is just a matter of time,"  Mr Kelly has recently conducted a survey of smart buildings, ranging in size from small businesses with just a handful of employees to those with thousands of staff.  It was the building management systems that jumped out as the most vulnerable.  "In all cases, pretty much without fail, these systems had been procured without thought to how to make them secure. I was absolutely shocked," he tells the BBC.  "We saw systems installed with default passwords where it would be a trivial exercise for someone remotely to gain access."  And he found many building management systems were plugged into the corporate network "without thought about who had access or the impact of someone accessing the data in this network".  Just as a plumber wouldn't worry about home security, so those installing building management systems may not think about security.  "Almost anyone can set up as a BMS installer - it is a bit like taking your car to a garage with mechanics with no qualifications," Mr Kelly says.  He recommends these smart systems are kept entirely separate from corporate networks, because it is virtually impossible to ensure the code behind them is hacker-proof.  Prof Thomas says: "These BMS systems have hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and yet the average programmer makes 20 mistakes in every 1,000 lines of code, so there are lot of bugs there."  For Mr Rios, the experiment at Google proved no company - even one of the most hi-tech in the world - is immune to the growing threat of insecure buildings.  In a report written about some of the vulnerabilities he found in buildings, he highlights one of the more unusual possible hacks.  He found Alabama's Bryant Denny football stadium had an exposed system that could have allowed hackers not just to turn off the lights and heating in parts of the stadium but also interfere with the game clock, which, in turn, could have affected the "integrity of the game".  "Imagine if a fan could impact the outcome of a professional or college sporting event while sitting comfortably on their home couch," he says.	tech

He won a by-election triggered by the death of Lord Avebury, a contest in which only three existing members of the House of Lords were able to vote.  Viscount Thurso was a member of the Lords for four years between 1995 and 1999 before leaving after Labour's reforms axed most hereditary members.  He then served as MP for Caithness and Sutherland for 14 years until last May.  Under existing Lords procedures, only existing Lib Dem hereditary peers in the Lords were entitled to vote in the contest. All of them - the Earl of Oxford and Asquith, the Earl of Glasgow and Lord Addington - voted for Viscount Thurso.  The six other candidates were Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor, the great grandson of the former Liberal prime minister David Lloyd George, Lord Calverley, the Earl of Carlisle, Lord Kennet, Earl Russell and Lord Somerleyton.  John Thurso is the grandson of Archibald Sinclair, the former Liberal Party leader who was a member of Winston Churchill's coalition government during World War Two.  He lost his parliamentary seat in last year's election and has since been appointed chair of VisitScotland.  Prior to Monday's election, each candidate was asked to submit a 75-word statement about their background and relevant experience.  The election has been described as a farce by Lord Avebury's son John Lubbock, who likened the contest and size of the electorate to a rotten borough from the 18th Century.  Reforms to the Lords by the last Labour government left just 92 hereditary peers in place. Since then vacancies arising from the death of members have been filled through a series of by-elections.	politics

Ministers wanted employees to organise the payment of union dues themselves by other means such as direct debit.  But unions argued that this would be more complicated for members and so lead to a loss of funds.  Lord Bridges of Headley announced a "pause" in the plans, saying there were "cannons" attacking them on all sides.  He told peers the government would change the Trade Union Bill to remove the end to "check-off" at its next stage in the House of Lords, saying the move had never been intended to undermine the union movement.  "Arguments have been made with considerable vim and vigour that by ending check-off and moving to direct debit, those on low pay and especially those who have pay day loans might have to cease being trade union members or have to pay extra bank charges," he said.  "Again, this is not our intention and never has been."  The payment of subscriptions by deduction from wages can now continue - providing the union bears the administrative cost.  The Conservative peer who led the parliamentary campaign against the move, Lord Balfe, said he was "delighted" to be able to tear up the speech he had been about to make opposing the government.  "I think it was clear to anyone who looked at the detail that the government's proposals on check-off stood to do considerable damage both to the unions themselves and to their members and potential members," he said.  "I was particularly concerned about the impact on low paid, mostly female workers, who stood to lose out on the protection and benefits of trade union membership."  The TUC welcomed the U-turn, thanking all of those who had lobbied the government over the issue.  "Banning workers from choosing to pay union subs in a convenient way through their payroll would, as many have warned, damaged industrial relations and morale in key services," said its general secretary Frances O'Grady.  "While this is an important milestone, the TUC remains opposed to the Trade Union Bill in its entirety and will continue to push for further changes when it is debated again in the House of Commons next week."  Ministers are standing by other key aspects of the bill, such as the introduction of electronic balloting and restrictions on political funds used by unions for campaigning, despite a series of defeats in the Lords.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36084244	Apple complies with greater proportion of US data demands	Apple is consistently more compliant with US requests for access to users' information than with the rest of the world on average, it has emerged.  Its own figures showed that, in 2015, Apple released data on users' devices to US authorities 80% of the time, compared to 55% when it came to the UK.  That compared to a global average of nearly 60%, Apple's data showed.  A security expert said it was "deeply frustrating" for law enforcement agencies.  Apple released its latest transparency report on Monday to complement previous releases going back as far as 2013.  It published the numbers of device requests it received - those from law enforcement for contact information and other data.  Separately, it released data on account requests - those from government agencies for account details, including iTunes and iCloud account information.  The BBC's analysis has revealed that, similar to in 2015, the UK was below the global average and the US above it for both types of request in each of the previous years for which there were comparable data.  Among the five countries that regularly submitted a large number of device requests - more than 2,000 per year - the US was the only country to consistently receive Apple customer information a greater-than-average proportion of the time. Singapore was also below the average in each of the three years.  Apple's figures showed that, on average, it was unable to release data for 33% of account requests from across the world in 2015. In the US, the rate was 18% and, in the UK, 40%. A similar picture emerged in 2014. A comparison of account requests in 2013 was not possible because Apple did not release exact figures for the US for that year.  The US and the UK were the only countries to make more than 300 account requests per year.  The consistently lower proportion of successful requests from the UK could be because Britain is seen as "less protective of personal privacy" than the US, said Prof Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey.  The security expert, who advises Europol and who has also advised GCHQ in the past, said: "Whatever the reason, it is a deeply frustrating situation for law enforcement agencies."  Despite Apple's presence in many countries outside the US, he added that it may also feel less duty bound to comply with requests from foreign governments.  According to Apple's report, the majority of device requests were in cases of lost or stolen phones and the BBC understands that some of the differences between countries were dependent on the differing approaches of national police forces towards phone theft.  The BBC also understands that some of the unsuccessful account requests were down to the company not holding any information, rather than resisting law enforcement efforts.  The firm declined to comment when contacted by the BBC.  On Monday, Blackberry's chief executive John Chen said the firm would comply with law enforcement but would prevent "government abuse of invading citizen's privacy".  He spoke in response to reports that Canadian police could intercept and read encrypted messages sent using Blackberry phones. Mr Chen said the firm "stood by [its] lawful access principles".	tech

The firm collects data from thousands of smartphone owners via an app.  Of the four UK networks, EE was found to have the best 4G connectivity, while Three had the worst.  However, Three also had the fastest download speeds when it was connected to 4G, the researchers found.  Three was the last operator to roll out 4G in December 2013 and told the BBC it was continuing to extend its 4G network every day.  "Almost everyone now uses a mobile phone service and it's not good enough that the UK is lagging behind so many countries with our 4G network coverage," said Richard Lloyd, executive director of Which.  The State of the Mobile Network report also noted that O2 had the highest 3G and 4G latency - that's the amount of time data takes to travel along a network, measured in milliseconds.  The firms have committed to investing in mobile networks. Last year, EE unveiled a £1.5bn three-year network investment plan that included the expansion of 4G and the commitment to reach 99% of the population with "superfast 4G".  However, mobile phone providers have faced planning issues when creating the necessary infrastructure, said analyst Kester Mann from CCS Insight.  "Network operators will maintain that they are investing millions of pounds each day in network coverage and capacity to satisfy the insatiable demand for mobile data services among UK consumers," he said.  "They will also cite tough planning restrictions to allow taller masts to provide wider coverage, a challenge recognised in George Osborne's recent Budget.  "These findings show that, although the UK is a leading market in the uptake of 4G services, there is still plenty of work to be done in network roll-out."	tech

The £379 ($544) device is designed to survive a 2m drop on to concrete and can operate in temperatures ranging from -20C to 60C.  Rival firm Caterpillar has already established itself as a brand in the physically tougher smartphone sector.  The so-called "tough phone" market is flourishing, a retailer told the BBC.  "Lots of people in the trade and construction industries, as well as outdoor sports enthusiasts, have realised that just having a thicker case isn't going to see them through," said James Booker, purchasing manager at UK firm Tuffphones.  To be be certified as a "tough phone", handsets have to undergo more rigorous physical tests, including being subjected to tumbling - turned over and over inside a device for long periods of time, Mr Booker explained.  They also have to be water and dust proof.  Because they are sturdier, they can also incorporate a bigger battery, he added - the Dewalt phone claims to offer up to eight hours of talk time.  "One of the main things about traditional smartphones is that they are svelte and slim - there's an obvious correlation with how large a battery they can get in there," Mr Booker said.  While most of its specifications are fairly standard for the sector, Dewalt's MD501 phone comes with in-built QI wireless charging, which is unusual, he added.  Its touchscreen is made of commercially manufactured Gorilla Glass - a highly robust but thin type of glass that works with gloved hands.  The handset is a collaboration with Global Mobile Communications, a rugged phone specialist.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36074849	EU membership 'good for UK environment' say MPs	Being a member of the European Union has benefited environmental protection in the UK, a group of MPs has argued.  The Environmental Audit Committee said efforts to reduce pollution and boost biodiversity had happened "faster" than otherwise would have been the case.  It said membership gave a platform to influence global climate change policy.  But ex-minister Peter Lilley said the MPs had ignored evidence and failed to address the case for deciding issues such as flooding at a national level.  Mr Lilley, who backs EU exit, published a dissenting view arguing the UK could happily negotiate environmental legislation at an intergovernmental level and have a greater say on some international bodies by having its own seat, rather than being represented by the EU.  However, Mr Lilley was overruled by other members of the committee, including its Labour chairwoman Mary Creagh, Green MP Caroline Lucas and Conservatives Peter Aldous and Peter Heaton-Jones.  The committee, the majority of whose members support remaining in the EU, said it hoped its report would "inform debate" on environmental issues ahead of the referendum on EU membership on 23 June.  It noted that the environment did not feature in any of David Cameron's demands in his recent re-negotiation of the UK's membership terms and that the UK was "broadly satisfied" with EU environmental policy.  EU membership had been a "crucial factor" in shaping UK environmental policy over the past 40 years, the committee said, contributing to improved air and water quality standards and better habitat management.  "The UK's membership of the EU has ensured environmental action was taken on a faster timetable and more thoroughly than would otherwise would have been case," it said.  At the same time, the report - which did not study the impact of the Common Agricultural Policy or Common Fisheries Policy - said the UK had been a "major player" in influencing the direction of environmental policy at an EU level and in designing specific directives and policies.  While some of those who gave evidence to the committee expressed concerns about how laws were drafted and implemented, and the cost to business of compliance, the MPs said none of them had made an "environmental case for leaving the European Union".  "EU environmental laws...mean we bathe on cleaner beaches, drive more fuel-efficient cars and can hold the government to account on air pollution," said Mrs Creagh, a former shadow environment secretary.  "Environmental problems don't respect borders," she added. "When it comes to protecting our natural environment and dealing with global problems like climate change, the overwhelming evidence is that EU membership has improved the UK's approach to the environment and ensured that the UK's environment has been better protected."  Friends of the Earth welcomed the report, saying the UK's environment is "best served working together with European partners".  But Mr Lilley, the former trade secretary who has sat on the committee since last summer, said the report's conclusions were "mutually contradictory" and many of those who gave evidence had "vested interests" because they received EU funding.  The UK, he said, had a strong record on environmental protection before joining the EU in 1973 - highlighting the Clean Air Acts of the 1950s, the Green Belt and the work of conservation bodies such as the National Trust and Campaign for the Protection of Rural England.  "If the EU has been making Britain more environmentally friendly, it is hard to argue that Britain has been making the EU take the lead in the environmentalism globally," he said. "We are either leader of follower, not both."  Rather than giving the UK enhanced leverage internationally, Mr Lilley said EU membership has deprived the UK of direct representation on ICCAT, an inter-governmental fishery organization responsible for the conservation of tunas, and it risked losing its vote on CITES, the body set up to protect wild animals and plants from commercial exploitation.  He claimed that areas of environmental conflict between the UK and EU - such as over levels of carbon emission reductions or the impact of bio-fuels on food production - were not mentioned in the report.  He also questioned why more attention had not been paid to the case for predominately national issues, such as river management, being handled at a UK level and for cross-border matters to be decided by national governments rather than by 28 states.  "Given the success of devolution within the UK, there is every reason to suppose that there is substantial scope for devolving power within the EU back to member states," he said.  The committee took evidence from academics, wildlife and other conservation bodies, farmers' groups and energy and transport companies as well as ministers and officials from the European Commission. Zac Goldsmith, the Conservative MP and London mayoral candidate who opposes EU membership, was not present when the report was approved last month.	politics

The Google-owned platform said select concerts from California's Coachella festival would be the first to use the virtual reality facility.  In addition, it announced videos on its service could now be enhanced with "spatial audio", which simulates the effect of sounds coming from different directions and distances.  One expert said the innovation could greatly enhance VR experiences.  The announcements were timed to coincide with the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) conference in Las Vegas, where several new virtual reality products are being launched.  GoPro, Adobe and Sky Italia are among those demoing new tech at the event.  YouTube made it possible to play interactive 360-degree videos on its site just over a year ago.  If viewed on a laptop, viewers can use a mouse to adjust their perspective. But if watched on a smartphone or VR headset, the experience becomes more immersive, as changes in viewpoint correspond to the movements of the device being used.  Until now, clips had to be uploaded to YouTube in their entirety and processed before they could be played back.  "From musicians to athletes to brands, creators have done some incredible things with this technology," blogged YouTube executive Neal Mohgan ahead of his NAB presentation.  "Now they'll be able to do even more to bring fans directly into their world, with 360-degree live-streaming."  Anyone owning a compatible 360-degree camera and the ability to upload video at between 10Mbps and 20Mbps - which is above the norm - can also broadcast videos of their own.  The move gives YouTube an edge over its rival Facebook, which lets users post either 360-degree clips or live streams, but not videos that combine both functions.  "We're seeing a lot of interest in virtual reality driven by the surge in affordable VR headsets that use smartphones as their screens," said Chris Green, a tech analyst at the business consultancy Lewis .  "And we're definitely at the land-grab stage at the moment. YouTube, Facebook - and I suspect a few others that will emerge very shortly - are going to push hard to be as dominant as early as possible."  YouTube also aims to gain an advantage by adding support for binaural recordings.  Also known as "3D audio", this means soundscapes recorded with special microphones can be panned to match the view, simulating the source of a noise moving around the user's head.  This should deliver a greater sense of presence.  "When you use your eyes, you are looking with a field-of-view of at best 120 to 180-degrees, depending on who you are," said Dr Gavin Kearney, an audio researcher at the University of York.  "But sounds are omni-directional - they are all around us.  "So, binaural audio is important from the aspect of VR because it lends itself to the realism, the immersion, of the experience.  "If you have good visuals but poor audio cues, it breaks the illusion of the reality you are trying to create. But with good binaural audio, it's much more plausible."  Headphones must be worn for the effect to be created, and it will only work via YouTube's Android app on pre-recorded clips at launch.  Google and Facebook are determined to be major players in this year's hot tech trend - virtual reality - and are currently the best bets for sharing 360-degree videos.  YouTube's plan to allow anyone to stream 360 video live on its platform could transform the way its huge global audience experiences events.  It could allow broadcasters to put viewers in a seat at Wembley during the Cup Final, or in the front of a Glastonbury audience - and allow them to look around and feel part of the crowd.  It could permit anyone with a cheap 360 video device to show their angle at a concert or a demo, though that would be likely to chew up their mobile data allowance in a hurry.  It's another step in the democratisation of the media. But as we've already discovered, user-generated content can be fascinating, challenging but often extraordinarily dull.  Just because you can look all around you, it does not mean there will be anything much to see.  Virtual reality tech is proving to be one of the big themes at NAB this year, which began on Sunday.  GoPro has confirmed the $5,000 (£3,520) price of a rig that features six of its cameras. The company is also showing off LiveVR - its own "broadcast-quality" live-streaming system, which it says will soon be used by the MotoGP and MotoAmerica racing competitions.  Meanwhile, Sphericam, a Czech start-up, is showing off a crowd-funded camera that can self-stitch and stream video at 30 frames per second (fps) for half the price.

The Court said it would not hear an appeal from the Authors Guild, which claimed Google breached copyright laws by scanning books without permission.  The technology giant began the process in 2004, so it could include extracts in a searchable database, and it was sued by the Authors Guild in 2005.  The Supreme Court's judgement is the final ruling on the matter.  Google's database of books lets people search through millions of titles and read passages and selected pages from them.  While some of the books in the database are old titles that are no longer protected by copyright, millions are more recent publications.  The Authors Guild had argued that the project undermined authors' ability to make money from their work.  Google said its database was a "fair use" of protected works, describing it as "a card catalogue for the digital age".  The firm could have faced billions of dollars in damages claims from authors if it had lost the case.  The Authors Guild said it was "disappointed" that the Supreme Court would not hear its appeal.  The organisation's president Roxana Robinson said: "We believed then and we believe now that authors should be compensated when their work is copied for commercial purposes".  A Google spokeswoman said: "We are grateful that the court has agreed to uphold the decision of the Second Circuit which concluded that Google Books is transformative and consistent with copyright law."	tech

The company, which hosts 1.7m sites in the UK, said an error made during maintenance "effectively deleted" what was on some of its servers.  "We can conclude that the issues faced have resulted in some data loss for some customers," the firm admitted.  It started a "recovery process", but advised customers with their own data backup to rebuild their own websites.  The web host, which has 800,000 customers in the UK, would not say how many websites had been deleted but said it was a "small proportion".  Websites are hosted on computers called servers that can dish up pages to thousands or millions of people at the same time.  Some people pay for a private server - a dedicated computer that hosts only their website - but this can be expensive.  A cheaper option is a virtual private server (VPS) - a machine that can host hundreds of websites, but mimics the functionality of a private server.  The company said it was performing a "clean up" operation on its VPS systems when an coding error in its software "effectively deleted" customer websites.  Since the maintenance mistake was made on a virtual private server it was able to wipe out many websites in one go.  It has not been clarified whether 123-reg kept a backup copy of all its customers' data.  But the BBC understands it does not have access to a copy of every website and so cannot simply restore them to a new server.  The company told the BBC: "Many of our customers keep their own backups. We are currently working with a team of experts on data recovery."  The data loss has left the affected online businesses without a website to trade from and 123-reg has been flooded with messages on social media criticising its limited communication.  One customer noted: "Fault still described as 'VPS connectivity issues' when in fact it seems they lost everything."  "There must be some information available right? What exactly are they working on?" asked another. "We need details as we need to start planning on how to salvage anything."  "This will wreck my business and plenty of others," said another affected company.  In an email sent to customers on Sunday, 123-reg said it had "begun copying recovered VPS images to new hosts" and expected some websites to be restored overnight.  It said it would audit all its automated scripts and prevent customer websites from being deleted without human approval in the future.	tech

Labour's ruling National Executive Committee rejected its application to set up a stand at the annual gathering.  The decision, which is thought to have cost the party £30,000 in sponsorship money, was criticised as "snobby" by one Labour MP.  A Labour spokeswoman said: "We do not comment on commercial decisions."  A McDonald's spokesman said: "We are disappointed with the decision that has been taken."  The company had reportedly wanted to mount an "interactive experience" display in support of British farm produce and is planning to rent space at the Conservative and SNP conferences.  Former Labour minister Ian Austin tweeted: "Why has @UKLabour turned down £30k from McDonald's? My first job was in their branch of Dudley High Street."  Labour MP Wes Streeting told the Sun on Sunday: "I'm exasperated that we should throw away £30,000 worth of sponsorship like this.  "It smacks of a snobby attitude towards fast-food restaurants and people who work or eat at them."  Hiring out exhibition space to charities and companies is a major source of income for Britain's political parties.  The Labour Party has come under fire in the past for renting stands to controversial companies, including, in 2013, tobacco giant Philip Morris.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36060369	Broadband speed advertising misleading, say MPs	The way broadband speeds are advertised is misleading and should be changed, a cross-party group of 50 MPs has said.  Internet providers are not in breach of current guidelines, even if only 10% of customers can obtain their fastest advertised speed, the group said.  The British Infrastructure Group is calling for greater powers to enable consumers to hold providers to account.  The Advertising Standards Authority said it was aware of concerns about speeds and would consider further work.  "Our position on broadband speed claims in ads is based on extensive work undertaken in recent years, including a full public consultation on new guidance," it said in a statement.  The report from the infrastructure group, which was set up by former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps, said consumers had "very few rights and protections" they can turn to if they are "poorly treated" by their internet service provider.  "Consumers must be given the power to hold their internet service provider to account when they let them down or outright mislead them into signing a contract that makes promises that bear no resemblance to the later reality," its report said.  "BIG will therefore be campaigning for mandatory refunds for anyone who has been mis-sold a broadband contract.  "Consumers also need the power to leave contracts if they are found to have been misled."  The group highlighted that there was no minimum level of compensation if customers received a poor service.  "Other industries, such as airlines and banks, are forced to compensate customers for errors, delays and poor practice, so why not broadband?" the report said.  Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 5 live: "You might sign up for 24 megabits of download speed, find that you don't get anywhere near that, you can't get any compensation, you can't get out of the contract, and it seems to us this is completely the wrong way round."  Ofcom has asked fixed-line internet service providers to sign up to a voluntary code of practice, which requires them to provide consumers with more information and advice on maximum broadband speeds.  But the infrastructure group said regulators needed greater powers to step in and "take real robust action" against providers found to be misleading customers.	politics

AMC chief executive Adam Aron had suggested the idea might encourage so-called millennials to visit the cinema.  But the plan was badly received on social media, where cinema-goers bombarded AMC with messages.  "We have heard loud and clear that this is a concept our audience does not want," the company said in a statement.  AMC operates almost 400 cinemas in the United States, with more than 5,000 screens. The chain also has a UK multi-screen complex in Manchester.  While many cinemas display messages before films asking people to switch off their mobile devices, Mr Aron had suggested that allowing mobile phone use during a film might appeal to young adults.  "When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow," he had explained in an interview with Variety magazine.  But the cinema chain has now admitted the idea had not gone down well with audiences.  "In this age of social media, we get feedback from you almost instantaneously," it said in a statement.  "This is an idea we have relegated to the cutting room floor... there will be no texting allowed in any of the auditoriums at AMC Theatres."  "Bravo for making the right decision," said one tweeter called Kristin.  "Thank you so much. I love you guys for this," added Shavonne.

"Simply download the beta and let the viscera fly," said Bethesda.  While many players expressed their delight on social media some complained that the new version felt slow and others took to the studio's message boards after facing server problems.  So far, 41% of 1,744 reviews on the Steam platform have been positive.  The BBC has contacted Bethesda for comment.  Doom was first released in 1993 and had 10 million players by 1995.  Software engineer and games developer Gary Riches told the BBC he grew up playing the original Doom games - and completed Doom 2 again just six months ago.  After trying out Doom 4 this morning, he said he felt the pace was much slower than its predecessors due to changes such as a single close-range shot no longer taking out an enemy, and the lack of weapons "hotspots" where weapons were created in the older games.  "I still like Doom 4 but it doesn't feel like Doom 4, it feels like a sequel to Quake or Unreal Tournament," he said.  "To me that's disappointing.

The Zero Day Initiative (ZDI) website said two vulnerabilities found in the Windows version of QuickTime had been reported to Apple.  But ZDI said it was "advised that the product would be deprecated on Windows" and that Apple would publish software removal instructions.  Apple has not officially announced the end of QuickTime on Windows.  QuickTime is a multimedia solution that was developed by Apple to handle video, audio and interactive content on its computers.  It was first released in 1991 and a version was later made available to download for Windows computers.  The Zero Day Initiative website publishes details of security holes in software that have not been patched or are being actively exploited in the wild.  Although QuickTime can still be downloaded from Apple's website, ZDI said the company had indicated it was no longer being updated on Windows systems.  In a security bulletin, security firm Trend Micro said newly discovered vulnerabilities left the software insecure.  "The only way to protect your Windows systems from potential attacks against these or other vulnerabilities in Apple QuickTime now is to uninstall it," it said.  However, it is understood QuickTime on a Mac will continue to receive updates.  Although Apple has not announced the end of QuickTime on Windows, its website describes part of the software package as a "legacy" tool.  Its guide to uninstalling QuickTime on Windows states: "Uninstalling QuickTime 7 also removes the legacy QuickTime 7 web plug-in, if present.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36052738	Microsoft's new bot 'still learning'	Microsoft's latest bot, designed to describe the contents of photographs, says it is "still learning" after receiving mixed reviews online.  The BBC found "Captionbot" was able to recognise James Bond actor Daniel Craig but not an Apple watch.  A bot is a computer program that is able to communicate with humans using artificial intelligence.  The tech giant's Twitter chatbot Tay had to be taken offline after it began tweeting abuse.  "The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets," the firm said when it launched, but people soon found they were able to teach the Twitter account to tweet extreme views and inappropriate remarks.  Tay's successor, Captionbot, has a stable of "siblings" including a bot which matches faces with celebrities, one which guesses the age of the person in a photograph and another which guesses dog breeds.  Built by Microsoft's Cognitive Services division, it uses the developer's' computer vision API (application programming interface) which extracts information from images from input such as tags.  It also uses the firm's Emotions API which analyses facial expression for a range of "universally communicated" emotions including anger, disgust, happiness and surprise.  While bots such as Captionbot may seem trivial they showcase the potential of the technology, Dr Aleks Krotoski told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  "If you think about all the stuff we do cognitively, to identify an image and put it in its context, trying to get a bunch of ones and zeros to do that is actually incredibly difficult," she said.  "Captioning looks to identify the context as well as the subject in each picture - that's very important for things like mapping and driverless cars."  The tech giants are excited by the potential of bots - Facebook announced big plans for the AI programmes at its annual developer conference earlier this week.  One of the first to launch on its platform will be Spring, an AI concierge.  "Spring is actually going to build an experience where everything is automated except customer service," Facebook's head of messaging David Marcus told the BBC.  "It's bot for 99.9%, but then if you have a problem, a human can actually jump in and sort out your problem.  "That's the best of both worlds."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36053219	Labour's EU migrant policy was not a failure, says Lord Blunkett	Lord Blunkett says he does not regret his 2004 decision to open UK borders to east European migrants, which led to a massive surge in immigration.  The former home secretary told the BBC it was a decision taken to allow people to work legally - not a "failure".  At the time, Labour ministers said 13,000 migrants a year would come - but that proved to be a huge underestimate.  Blunkett's predecessor as Labour home secretary Jack Straw has described the policy as a "spectacular mistake".  Unlike France and Germany, which did not give migrants from the eight countries which joined the EU in May 2004 full access to their labour market until 2011, the then Labour government did not insist on any transitional controls.  Asked whether he regretted the failure to do so, Mr Blunkett told Radio 4's PM programme: "No, I don't. It was a decision, it wasn't a failure.  "It was a decision to allow people to work legally, openly, transparently, to pay taxes and national insurance and the numbers coming in openly, legally and working are a fraction of those who Germany have taken because they are refugees."  He said the failure was not to "put in place the mechanisms to absorb and to support those people coming in and to support the communities who were hosting them - not the decision to be open and transparent about it".  He added that he did not believe the policy was ultimately responsible for stoking Euroscepticism in the UK.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of pressure group Migration Watch UK said: "It is surprising that Lord Blunkett has no regrets about one of the most serious blunders committed by his government.  "They based themselves on a report that predicted a maximum of 13,000 net migration a year.  "We said at the time that this prediction was 'almost worthless'.  "In the event the population of East Europeans increased by nearly a million in the following ten years.  "This had a huge impact on public services and housing in many communities, for which the government failed to provide."  Only the UK, Ireland and Sweden fully opened their borders to nationals of the eight states that joined the EU in May 2004, which included Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary.  At the time the government quoted research suggesting the move would increase the UK population by 13,000 a year - although the author of that report has since said it was misinterpreted. More than 400,000 work permits were approved by June 2006.  Then Home Office Minister Beverley Hughes told MPs in 2003: "The number coming here for employment will be minimal."  Jack Straw, Mr Blunkett's predecessor as home secretary, has since described the policy as a "spectacular mistake".  He said handing immediate working rights to Poles and others when they joined the EU nine years ago was a "well-intentioned policy we messed up".  Office for National Statistics data suggests that there were 76,000 arrivals to the UK from the eight countries that joined the EU in 2004 in the year to December 2005, 92,000 the following year and 112,000 the year after.  Figures from the University of Oxford's Migration Observatory suggests "net flow" of EU nationals - taking into account people leaving and and arriving in the UK - shot up from 15,000 in 2003 to 87,000 in 2004 and continued to rise until 2007 when it reached 127,000 a year.	politics

In 2011, a police officer pepper-sprayed students protesting at UC Davis, California, at close range.  The university later hired consultants to "eradicate references" to the incident in search results.  UC Davis said it wanted the reputation of the university to be "fairly portrayed".  Videos of the incident, which have been viewed millions of times online, show a police officer pepper-spraying students who were peacefully protesting on the university campus.  In a statement issued at the time, university Chancellor Linda Katehi said she was "deeply saddened" by the event and took "full responsibility for the incident" but refused to resign when challenged by the university's academic staff association.  "I do not think that I have violated the policies of the institution," she said.  Documents released after an investigation by local newspaper the Sacramento Bee found that the university hired consultancy Nevins & Associates in 2013 to "eliminate" Google search results.  The consultants identified "online evidence" and "venomous rhetoric about UC Davis" was being shared online.  The campaign was also designed to eliminate negative search results about Ms Katehi.  Documents suggested this could be achieved with a "flood of content with positive sentiment and off-topic subject matter", and proposed hosting content on Google's own services, which would appear higher in the firm's search results.  Speaking to the Sacramento Bee, UC Davis spokeswoman Dana Topousis said: "We have worked to ensure that the reputation of the university, which the chancellor leads, is fairly portrayed."  The consultancy was paid by the university's communications department. Its budget has increased from almost $3m in 2009, to $5.5m in 2015.	tech

Plenty of Conservatives doubt it, despite the plan being announced at the Budget. This is what's going on.  First Conservative councillors complained. Then Tory MPs spoke out - not anonymously briefing journalists but laying into the policy in the House of Commons. In a remarkable debate, normally loyal Tories attacked one after another, including some parliamentary aides who are supposed to toe the line.  One - Steve Brine, who works for the health secretary Jeremy Hunt - told BBC Radio 4's Today there was "great concern" among Tories and the government needed a "way out". Labour are doing everything they can to turn opposition into rebellion.  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan is set to make a public commitment the plan won't result in school closures. She has written to every Conservative MP to say six years will be enough time for schools to make plans. Schools minister Nick Gibb has been trying to change minds in the Commons tearoom. They're arguing academies are simply better for pupils, parents and teachers.  There won't be a chance to kill the plan for a while. When Labour prompted a debate on this, the government motion managed to avoid spelling out the policy, so MPs didn't have to back it. It's not yet written into a bill.  And when - perhaps if - they do vote on it there's every chance rules to give English MPs a greater say on laws that only affect England will help the government. But sceptical Tory MPs are watching carefully to see whether this features in the Queen's Speech setting out the government's plan for new laws. If it doesn't, they'll be certain a climbdown is coming.  Teachers, parents and councillors concerned about the plan are doing a good job of rattling MPs, who are keenly aware of how it is going down in their constituencies.  Tories back the idea of academies, and of creating more academies, but plenty don't see why good schools have to be forced to convert to this timescale. They are also worried about a proposed change that means parent governors would no longer be required.  This was the headline announcement on the morning of the Budget. Having abandoned plans to cut disability benefit, dumping it would damage not only Education Secretary Nicky Morgan but her old boss at the Treasury George Osborne too.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36046939	Steel jobs 'can be saved by tech', says energy researcher	The UK steel industry is doomed unless it embraces cutting-edge technology, a Cambridge professor has warned.  Prof Julian Allwood said the only way to save steel jobs was to make high-value products for industries in which the UK leads the world.  New methods could scrub impurities from recycled steel to make products for the aerospace and car industries, he said.  It comes as efforts are being made to save thousands of jobs at Tata Steel's Port Talbot steel plant in south Wales.  The announcement by the Indian company that it is to sell its UK business is the latest blow to an industry which has seen a succession of job cuts.  Prof Allwood said current plans for the steel industry did not go far enough, because they did not utilise the latest technology.  In his six-year study on the steel sector, the predicament of the industry appears stark.  "The global steel industry today has more capacity for making steel from iron ore than it will ever need again," he said.  "On average, products made with steel last 35 to 40 years, and around 90% of all used steel is collected. This is easy because it's magnetic.  "The supply of steel collected from goods at the end of their life therefore lags the supply of new steel by about 40 years."  Who might buy Tata in Port Talbot?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  Prof Allwood said the steel market would continue to grow - but all future demand growth could be met by recycling the existing stock of steel.  And it was, therefore, futile for the UK to attempt to compete against low-wage economies for mass market steel.  Reducing industrial electricity costs in Britain would help, but only a little, he said, and the UK should instead concentrate on recycled steel.  That is what is proposed by Sanjeev Gupta, the entrepreneur who has expressed interest in turning the Port Talbot works into a recycling plant.  But Prof Allwood said that plan did not go far enough, because most scrap metal contained impurities that made it suitable for only low-value products, such as steel reinforcing bars, which were subject to heavy international competition.  It would be far better, he said, to harness science to make pure hi-tech steel that met the needs of the UK's leading industries.  "UK taxpayers will have to bear costs of Tata Steel's decision to close the Port Talbot plant," he said.  "If the existing operations are to be sold, taxpayers must subsidise the purchase without the guarantee of a long-term national gain.  "If the plants are closed, the loss of jobs, income and livelihoods will reverberate throughout the UK steel supply chain.  "Instead, the strategy presented here enables taxpayers to invest in a long-term structural transformation.  "This would allow UK innovation ahead of any other large player."  While many will applaud his analysis, some will ask how this theoretical model can be translated into real equipment and jobs - especially as the UK does not have an industrial strategy that would encourage this sort of thing.  Prof Allwood pointed towards the Danish wind industry as an example of successful government strategy to create jobs with a new product.  The steel transformation in the UK could be funded by a long-term loan from the government, which will have to bear the costs one way or another.  It would involve many of the current jobs being saved, but workers would need to retrain.  Prof Allwood said the hi-tech transformation had not happened yet because low margins in the European steel industry had squeezed investment - and China did not have the stock of old steel to make it relevant yet.  He said it might take three to five years to develop the technologies needed to transform the industry.  It would be estimated to cost £1-2bn, which he said was good value compared with the social costs of shutting the industry.  Dr Sarah Green, a metallurgist from Lancaster University, said: "It's common sense to maximise recycling efficacy in the UK steel materials cycle.  "Whether this alone will generate sufficient economic activity on a suitable timescale to offer a substitute for the current steelmaking sector is something that I am less certain of."  Gareth Stace, of UK Steel, told BBC News: "We don't agree that there won't be a new need for virgin steel - we think we need more capacity.  "But we welcome this report - especially the recognition that the steel sector has been starved of investment in technology because of the crisis we have been in for years.  "There are steelmakers in the UK that make world class steel, but we are desperate for more investment."  Another expert also called for more research.  "The task is getting harder at the moment because impurities from copper get greater the more wiring there is in cars," said Prof Sridhar Seetharaman, chair in low carbon materials technology at the University of Warwick.  "Britain could lead the way by government supporting funding in this."	tech

Labour's Rupa Huq criticised Citizen Khan's depiction of a "quite backward" family of Muslims.  The show was accused of stereotyping Muslims when it started in 2012 and its creator, Adil Ray, has told the Radio Times he had received death threats.  The BBC said the award-winning show had received much positive feedback.  But Ms Huq, MP for Ealing Central and Acton, whose sister Konnie is a former Blue Peter presenter, said: "I feel as if I didn't know what the year is ... you would think it's an everyday tale of a Birmingham family of Muslims but they're really quite backward.  "Again, the Islamophobic point [Labour MP Chuka Umunna] made, it's a beardy weirdy chap and they're not quite cutting off people's hands but I can imagine that being in a future episode."  Citizen Khan prompted complaints when it launched in 2012 and Mr Ray has previously said he had received abuse from people who believed it was making fun of Islam or stereotyping Muslims.  But the show has won various awards at the Royal Television Society and Asian Media Awards.  A BBC spokesman said: "The fact that Citizen Khan returns for its fifth series this year is a sign of its popularity with all audiences - indeed the show has won several awards, including Best TV character at the Asian Media Awards.  "We've also had positive comments from members of the Muslim community for the show and for creator Adil Ray who, like the family portrayed, is a British Pakistani Muslim. As with all sitcoms the characters are comic creations and not meant to be representative of the community as a whole."  Ms Huq made her comments during a backbench debate called by former culture minister David Lammy.  Mr Lammy accused the BBC of hiring "the same old faces from the same old schools to the same old jobs" and said he had been contacted by black and Asian BBC staff who said "that they cannot speak up because they do not want to be labelled a troublemaker".  He also said the Chinese community was "totally invisible" on the broadcaster and said the BBC's new charter must address the lack of progress in boosting ethnic minority representation.  He said although the BBC ran 29 schemes aimed at ethnic minorities between 1999 and 2014, the situation was not improving and the proportion of ethnic minority staff had dropped from 13.1% in 2015 to 12.2% now.  The Labour MP for Tottenham praised the diversity of children's television, BBC Three and documentaries but questioned whether there was sufficient diversity in management.  He said: "We all go into Broadcasting House and see the security, see black staff at the junior ends, but walk into that newsroom, think about the editorial decisions that are being made, and ask yourself, is that really representative of our country as a whole?"  Conservative MP Helen Grant suggested the BBC could voluntarily disclose data on the recruitment, retention, promotion and pay of staff from ethnic minorities.  Labour Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said the BBC should reflect every region in the UK, adding that Salford - where the BBC's MediaCity UK is based - was "not where the North ends".  Earlier, Mr Umunna attacked the "representation of our Muslim communities" on TV.  He said "rising Islamophobia" could partly be blamed on broadcasters' use of "community leaders who purport to speak for that community but have no mandate whatsoever to do so".  The BBC said it was "making good progress" on becoming more diverse but said it would continue to develop "new and innovative ideas to do even better" and would soon be setting out its new diversity strategy.  "Almost half of our workforce is made up of women and the proportion of our workforce who are black, Asian and other ethnic minority is at an all-time high," the spokesman added.	politics

The Commons Public Administration Committee said it was concerned Peter Riddell, formerly of the Times, had the right experience for the job.  It also fears he may not get the powers he needs to prevent cronyism.  The man he replaces as commissioner for public appointments, Sir David Normington, welcomed him to the role.  "I know Peter to be a person of integrity and independence who will want to ensure that public appointments are made on merit," said the former top civil servant.  But he added: "I fear he may have his work cut out."  Sir David told The Financial Times government ministers, including David Cameron, had been pushing for Conservative donors and ex-MPs to be given key jobs at the head of public sector organisations since the general election.  And he warned that plans to change the way public appointments, such as directors of the Bank of England or the board of regulators like Ofcom, are made could see "a return to the days of political and personal patronage".  Mr Riddell, a former head of the Institute for Government think tank, was last month quizzed about his suitability for his new role by the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee (PACAC).  In a report, the committee said it endorsed his appointment, but added that "this endorsement is not unqualified", saying it planned to be a "critical friend" to the new commissioner.  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, said: "While there was no formal objection recorded to his appointment, some members of PACAC expressed their concern that Mr Riddell lacks experience of working in a large organisation, or in a regulated environment, or in making or supervising major appointments."  These concerns were "amplified" by plans to reduce the powers of the commissioner to directly influence recruitment decisions, added Mr Jenkin.  The Public Accounts Committee said it was concerned planned changes to the system, proposed by the businessman Sir Gerry Grimstone, would lead to the "politicization" of major public appointments.  The Grimstone proposals would allow ministers to choose a candidate who the interview panel had deemed "below the line of appointability", although the decision would have to be justified publicly, or ditch the formal recruitment process altogether to secure a specific candidate.  The government says the planned changes will increase transparency and accountability and will include strong safeguards.	politics

UKIP donor Arron Banks reacted angrily to news that the group he was backing had not been selected, claiming the decision was "corrupt".  But he said he had decided not to seek a judicial review after talking to UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  Mr Farage has said he will campaign with any group that wants an EU exit.  Mr Banks' Leave.EU group was affiliated to Grassroots Out (GO), the group that lost out to Vote Leave.  Announcing its decision on Wednesday, the Electoral Commission said Vote Leave had "better demonstrated that it has the structures in place to ensure the views of other campaigners are represented in the delivery of its campaign"  "It therefore represents, to a greater extent than 'Go Movement Ltd', those campaigning for the 'Leave' outcome, which is the test we must apply," it added.  Mr Banks signalled his intention to launch a legal challenge immediately after the news that Vote Leave had won the official designation, and said it could delay the referendum - taking place on 23 June - until October.  After consulting lawyers, he said: "What is clear now is that if we were to pursue a judicial review, according to legal experts, we would win."  But explaining the group's change of heart, he added: "But this is a time to take a step back from the matter, and after consulting with leading campaigners on this issue, including UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage - we have decided to show the public how this process was stitched up, but not to pursue the judicial review any further."  He said it was time to "turn our collective guns on the real opponents" in the referendum campaign - those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.  "We will be pursuing this campaign with vigour - and we'll have some fun with it along the way," he said.  Britain Stronger In Europe, led by former Marks and Spencer boss Lord Rose, is the lead campaign for the Remain side.	politics

John Penrose said the report's author, Sir John Chilcot, would understand the frustration at how long it was taking.  Conservative MP David Davis said the delay could cost lives as subsequent deployment decisions are taken without the lessons learned from Iraq.  Sir John set himself a deadline of next week to finish writing the report.  The inquiry, which is considering how UK forces came to participate in the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and its aftermath, began in 2009 under former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown.  In October Sir John said the text of the report would be finished on 18 April, at which point national security checking could begin, with a view to publishing in June or July 2016.  Mr Penrose, a minister in the Cabinet Office, told MPs the government was expecting to receive the report next week but that the publication timetable would be controlled by Sir John.  "The government's contribution, which is the national security checking, will be done in two weeks or less, and we will deliver on our pledge," he said.  Mr Penrose said Sir John would "understand the thirst to see the results of his work" and would have "listened to the tone and tenor of this debate".  He also said there was nothing in the rules governing the EU referendum that would mean the report could not be published until after the 23 June poll.  Mr Davis and other MPs called for publication in the first week of May.  The former shadow home secretary said: "The longer we leave it the less useful these lessons will be and the more likely it is that we will make the same mistakes.  "A decision such as those that were made in Libya, Syria and Iraq are made without the knowledge or facts, mistakes are made, and sometimes people die as a result.  "It's not hyperbole to say delay to the Iraq Inquiry could cost lives because bad decisions could be made - I would go further, I'd say it probably did cost lives because bad decisions were made."  Downing Street said the prime minister wanted the report to be published "as soon as possible".  Mr Cameron's spokeswoman said once it was completed the process of national security checking could begin, then it needed to be proofread - "so that may take some time".  In his October letter to the prime minister, Sir John said security checking was "normal and necessary" with inquiries handling large amounts of sensitive material.  "I consider that once national security checking has been completed it should be possible to agree a date for publication in June or July 2016," he added.	politics

Games studio Blizzard Entertainment no longer operates servers for the original WoW, which was first released in 2004, so some fans run their own.  On 10 April, a popular fan server known as Nostalrius, with 150,000 active members, was closed after the threat of legal action by Blizzard Entertainment.  Blizzard has yet to respond to the BBC.  World of Warcraft is an online multi-player game in which players explore a vast landscape, complete quests and interact with other gamers.  The original game from 2004 has since been updated with new instalments that some players say have materially changed the experience of the game, so some fans have set up their own servers to play the original, "vanilla" WoW.  Blizzard has previously said it had no plans to reopen access to the "classic" game.  "We realise that some of you feel that World of Warcraft was more fun in the past than it is today, and we also know that some of you would like nothing more than to go back and play the game as it was back then," wrote a Blizzard community manager in 2011.  "The developers however prefer to see the game continuously evolve and progress, and as such we have no plans to open classic realms or limited expansion content realms."  The decision to close fan-run server Nostalrius, which had attracted 800,000 players during its year online, has prompted anger from parts of the online gaming community.  Many who commented on the closure acknowledged the fact that running servers such as Nostalrius was technically illegal but said Blizzard should support non-profit fan-driven projects to keep the game going.  "World of Warcraft meant a lot, to a lot of people," said YouTube gamer Jon Jafari in a widely-shared video.  "It might seem silly because it's just a game... but this game was a big part of my life and a lot of people's lives. All these people want to do is go back and play it.  "If the server is making a profit, I can see them taking down something like that - but a lot of these are just for the love of the old game."  Commenting on its closure, the team behind Nostalrius posted: "We never saw our community as a threat for Blizzard. It sounds more like a transverse place where players can continue to enjoy old World of Warcraft's games no longer available."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36037324	What does shake-up of EU data laws really mean?	The European Parliament has voted on the biggest shake-up of data protection laws for 20 years.  The data protection regulation's stated aim is to give citizens back control of their personal data as well as simplifying the regulatory environment.  It could mean huge fines for companies that breach the law and offer some complex problems about how they store, delete and return data to citizens.  Here is a quick guide to what is involved.  It is a modernisation of data protection laws drawn up in 1995, before mass internet adoption.  Four years in the making, the new laws' stated aim is to strengthen the rights individuals have over their data and make companies take the issue of data protection far more seriously.  Although much of the legislation stays the same, the new rules offer "significant powers around the edges", according to Peter Church, a technology expert from law firm Linklater.  In December, the EU Commission, Parliament and Council of Ministers reached agreement on the General Data Protection Regulation, after months of negotiations, and on Thursday the document went before the European Parliament for a formal vote.  The rules will come into force in the summer. Then, member states will have two years to comply.  The most significant change will be an increase in the amount of money regulators can fine companies who do not comply with the legislation - up to 4% of their global turnover or 20m euros (£15.8m), whichever is greater.  Having this threat hanging over companies is going to make them to shake up the way they deal with data, says Mr Church.  "People will start taking data protection a lot more seriously," he says. It could also stifle innovative uses of data, with companies concerned about "falling foul of regulation".  Businesses will also be required to show how they are complying with the legislation.  "A regulator could knock on the door, and companies will have to have the mechanics in place and show the systems that they have to achieve compliance, says Ruth Boardman, a partner with law firm Bird and Bird.  It also makes it mandatory for large companies to employ a data protection officer.  The legislation is fiendishly complicated, though, and many predict it will take companies and regulators a good while to get their heads around it.  Data breaches, for example, must be reported within 72 hours - a regulation most agree could be extremely hard for businesses to comply with.  The legislation will apply to any company that handles EU citizens' data, even if that company is not based in Europe.  It has long been argued consumers often have no idea what happens to their data once they relinquish it to the big technology companies, and it is unclear whether this new set of rules will change that.  Companies will have to be more transparent about how they are using data, but this is likely to translate as even more complex privacy policies individuals, if they read them at all, may not fully understand.  There are provisions that could increase consumers' rights over their data, but there are big questions about how they will apply in practice.  For example, the controversial right to be forgotten is being extended beyond web searches to all aspects of online life - so someone could ask Facebook or another social network to delete their profile entirely.  It is unlikely to extend to news articles that people want removed, which are likely to be protected under freedom of expression rules.  Similarly, there is provision in the new regulation for consumers to transfer their data from one service to another.  This could be a massive boon for consumers - allowing them to swap internet or email provider more easily and to shop around for services such as utilities and insurance.  Questions arise though over how companies would actually give data back, in what format and, more crucially, what data the user is considered to have provided.  In the case, for example, of someone wishing to transfer their web email service from Google to Yahoo, "would it apply just to emails that you sent or could you argue that email replies sent to you have, in effect, been provided by you to Google?" asks Ms Boardman.  Or, in the case of someone wanting to transfer their data from one utility or insurance provider to another or even to many, to ensure they get the best deal, "your name and address is probably data you provided, but companies could argue that your gas usage is something that they have collected directly", says Ms Boardman.  Privacy is now big business, with consultants and lawyers lining up to advise companies on how to implement the changes and make sure their policies and procedures are in order.  The need to have more data protection officers could make companies go on a recruitment drive, but whether there are sufficient people to fill such posts is less clear.  Companies could see more legal challenges from individuals and consumer groups that take up privacy issues on behalf of citizens, but they may also see less challenges from individual country regulators, because of a "one-stop shop" clause that would put the onus on the regulator in the country in which the company is headquartered to pursue legal action.  Regulators are also being given more powers to intervene if they feel another is being too lenient.  "If one regulator is unhappy with how another is dealing with a case, there is a mechanism to get them to toughen up their approach," says Mr Church.  This could mean regulators take a tougher line on US technology companies such as Google and Facebook.  The legislation is as yet untested, and it remains to be seen whether companies will face more legal challenges over how they handle and process data and whether consumers feel they have wrested back control of their information.	tech

A developer has created a software patch to make titles bundled with the Rift headset compatible with the Vive.  Currently, it works with only two games - Lucky's Tale and Oculus Dreamdeck. More patches for other games are expected to follow.  However, one user said, the patch may prove tricky to install for those unfamiliar with PC technology.  A developer known as LibreVR put the patch on the Github code-sharing site for anyone to download and use.  Sam Machkovech, a writer for the news site Ars Technica, said it had allowed him to run Lucky's Tale via the SteamVR game-playing system used by the Vive.  The patch also preserves some elements unique to the HTC Vive such as the "chaperone" system that keeps an eye on a gamer's surroundings and warns if they stray too close to walls or other obstacles.  However, the ported game can only be played via an Xbox controller rather than with the Vive's motion controllers.  Mr Machkovech said the patch was significant because, before now, although the Oculus could get at games accessible via SteamVR, Vive owners could not get at many Oculus games.  But installing and running the patch might prove tricky for some because of the combination of files it needed to get games working.  "HTC Vive owners now have a free, simple way to access some of Oculus's most impressive launch offerings," wrote Mr Machkovech.  Oculus has yet to respond to news about the LibreVR patch, although in the past it has said it would be happy for people to change or "mod" its games.	tech

AMC chief executive Adam Aron said he wanted to encourage so-called millennials to visit the cinema.  He told Variety magazine: "You can't tell a 22-year-old to turn off their cellphone. That's not how they live their life."  But he said he would have to find a solution that did not disturb other movie-goers.  AMC operates almost 400 cinemas in the United States, with more than 5,000 screens. The chain also has a UK multi-screen complex in Manchester.  In February the firm announced its intention to buy rival Carmike, which will make it the largest cinema chain in the US.  But Mr Aron said young adults today were not visiting the cinema as much as their parents did when they were young.  "We need to reshape our product in some concrete ways so that millennials go to movie theatres with the same degree of intensity as baby boomers went to movie theatres throughout their lives," he explained.  Many cinemas display messages before films asking people to switch off their mobile devices.  Mr Aron suggested that allowing mobile phone use during a film might appeal to young adults.  "When you tell a 22-year-old to turn off the phone, don't ruin the movie, they hear please cut off your left arm above the elbow," he said.  But he admitted: "Today's movie-goer doesn't want somebody sitting next to them texting or having their phone on.  "What may be more likely is we take specific auditoriums and make them more texting-friendly."  In 2003, a cinema in Ireland was told it broke the law by installing a signal blocker that prevented people using their devices.	tech

The offence is alleged to have occurred two months ago and was brought to the authorities' attention by someone who said they had seen the broadcast.  The accused's lawyer says that she "categorically" denies the charges.  An expert said the case highlighted the impossibility of controlling content on live-streaming services, which are gaining in popularity.  According to the indictment, the sexual assault took place in the city of Columbus on 27 February.  Marina Lonina is also accused of taking a photo of the 17-year-old in a state of undress the previous night.  Lonina's boyfriend, Raymond Gates, has been accused of carrying out the assault. It is not yet known how he intends to plead.  The two face charges of rape, kidnapping, sexual battery and pandering sexually-oriented matter involving a minor.  Twitter could not be reached for comment.  But this is not the first time Periscope has been linked to an alleged offence.  Earlier this month, it was reported that police in London had intervened after a fight between two rival gangs had been arranged via the app.  The app has hosted more than 100 million broadcasts since it launched last year, the vast majority of which are innocuous.  But the issue of live-streamed crime could become more common as the activity becomes more mainstream.  Earlier this week, Facebook announced it was adding a tab to its app to help users find live-streamed videos.  The social network had already altered the algorithm of its news feeds to prioritise such feeds.  "The volume of content being created and uploaded every day is far too great to be regulated manually and automatic systems are simply too inaccurate to be practical," commented Dr Joss Wright from the Oxford Internet Institute.  "There is almost no practical way to prevent content like this being uploaded and shared if people want to do it and any system to do so would also have serious implications for freedom of expression and the publication of legitimate but controversial content.  "The internet has undoubtedly made this case worse for the alleged victim. But as with other real-world crimes, prevention is not always possible."	tech

Gisela Stuart, the Labour MP who chairs Vote Leave, said a "daunting fiscal and demographic crunch" will require tax rises of 18% across the euro area.  Her speech came ahead of the Electoral Commission announcing Vote Leave as the official Out campaign.  Backers of EU exit have been boosted by news that a group of Tory donors is considering giving them up to £5m.  Britain Stronger In Europe has been designated as the lead campaign for the In side.  It and Vote Leave will each have a spending limit of £7m while other groups taking part in the campaign are limited to £700,000 expenditure.  In her speech, Ms Stuart cited research by Vote Leave which the group says shows spending on public pensions across the eurozone is estimated to rise by 2.1% of GDP by 2020, and the cost of debt interest payments to go up from 1.8% to 6.9% of GDP over the next 35 years.  It suggests that tax rises of 17.6% will be needed to plug the gap and that the UK, while outside the euro, will "inevitably" be affected.  "The priorities of the eurozone will gradually and inevitably take over Brussels institutions," Ms Stuart said. "If we don't want to be part of this we must vote Leave."  The government has said it has negotiated safeguards to ensure it will not have to contribute to any future bailouts across the eurozone while the International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday that a UK exit from the EU could cause "severe economic damage".  The IMF - one of the main pillars of the global economic order - said a so-called Brexit would disrupt established trading relationships and cause "major challenges" for the UK and the rest of Europe.  But Ms Stuart said that her experience, as a former Labour minister, in negotiating the EU's Lisbon Treaty in 2009 exposed her to the EU's "mule-like refusal to listen to democratic concerns" or accept any "deviation from the orthodoxy of political integration".  Democratic accountability and economic competitiveness were "downgraded", said, "in case they become a diversion from the European project". "I call it integration at whatever the cost or consequences," she added.  Grassroots Out - another group campaigning for EU exit - has said it was "delighted" that the Midlands Industrial Council, a wealthy group of Conservative Party donors - are offering to help bankroll the Leave campaign.  The Council, which does not publish its accounts or the names of its supporters, have been one of the Tories' main financial backers, giving up to £2m to the party a year in recent times.  David Wall, its secretary who sits on the board of Grassroots Out, told the Daily Telegraph that the organisation was "incandescent with rage" about the government's decision to spend £9m on sending pro-EU leaflets to every UK household.  He told the paper that it could potentially give up to £5m to the campaign to leave the EU over the next two months.  Britain Stronger in Europe - the official In campaign - has claimed the support of more than 35 FTSE 100 company bosses.  Employers' group the CBI is highlighting the links between UK and European business, arguing EU membership has helped attract £377bn of investment from France, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands alone.  "European businesses are clear that 40 years' worth of collaboration through the EU is critical to attracting investment to the UK - let's not turn our back on our closest partners," said the CBI's director general Carolyn Fairbairn.  Meanwhile, the EEF manufacturers' organisation is warning that the UK economy is "heavily reliant" on migrant labour, with EU nationals accounting for 10% of the workforce in the industrial sector "without whom it would not function".	politics

Four newspapers knew about the relationship, which ended in 2014, but decided not to publish the story.  Shadow culture secretary Maria Eagle said it had left him "vulnerable" to pressure from the press.  Mr Whittingdale, who says he had not known the woman was a sex worker, said it had not affected his decisions.  Downing Street said Mr Whittingdale was "a single man entitled to a private life" and had the full confidence of the prime minister.  As culture secretary, Mr Whittingdale's job is to regulate newspapers and he is currently overseeing a new regulatory framework under consideration in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.

At no time did she give me any indication of her real occupation and I only discovered this when I was made aware that someone was trying to sell a story about me to tabloid newspapers. As soon as I discovered, I ended the relationship.  "This is an old story which was a bit embarrassing at the time. The events occurred long before I took up my present position and it has never had any influence on the decisions I have made as culture secretary."  At the time of the relationship, Mr Whittingdale was chairman of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport select committee.  He was made culture secretary in May 2015, more than a year after the relationship ended.  Downing Street told Newsnight it was not aware of Mr Whittingdale's relationship before his appointment to the cabinet job.  David Cameron first knew about the story "about ten days ago", a spokesman added.  New ministers routinely sit down with their department's most senior civil servant, the permanent secretary, to talk through anything that might cause a problem.  We don't know whether John Whittingdale told Sue Owen, at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport CMS, about the embarrassing personal story that had been hawked around Fleet Street for over a year.  Given that Downing Street says it only learned about it 10 days ago, if he did say anything, it would seem it was not passed on.  Having ended the relationship 15 months earlier, Mr Whittingdale may argue there was no longer anything that could look like a conflict of interest, nothing that might appear to place him under an improper obligation.  Four newspapers - the People, part of the Mirror Group, the Mail on Sunday, from the Daily Mail group, the Sun, part of News UK, and the now online-only Independent - had investigated the claims against Mr Whittingdale.  They did not publish the story, concluding it was not in the public interest.  Tom Newton-Dunn, the Sun's political editor, told Sky News: "We didn't publish the story because, quite frankly, there is no story.  "He is a single man, a divorced man. You can pretty much have a relationship with anyone you want."  However, James Cusick, a former Independent reporter who looked at the story for five months, said the public had a right to know the story as Mr Whittingdale was making decisions on how newspapers and the BBC could conduct themselves.  He said: "If this individual is making these decisions... you have a right to know about this man's private life and whether there is something in it he is trying to hold back from you."  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the question for Mr Whittingdale was not about his relationship, but about his role in regulating the press when the newspapers had a story about his private life.  Shadow culture secretary Ms Eagle accused Mr Whittingdale of changing his stance over the Leveson Inquiry, having previously supported a second stage - which was set to look into ties between newspapers and the police.  Earlier this year, it was reported in the Times that the second half would be "quietly" shelved.  Ms Eagle also called on him to clarify why he had not yet implemented key recommendations made by the inquiry, including some involving the awarding of costs against publishers in legal disputes.  The government says it has not decided whether to pursue a second stage of the inquiry. A No 10 spokesman said: "We've always said that criminal investigations and legal processes relating to Leveson need to have fully concluded before we consider part two."  Shadow international development secretary Diane Abbott said it had long been her view that Mr Whittingdale's close relationship with the family of Rupert Murdoch - whose company News UK publishes the Sun - made him an "unsuitable person to deal with press regulation".  However, shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn said Mr Whittingdale "ought to get on and do his job", including pressing ahead with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry.  Media commentator and former newspaper editor Roy Greenslade said newspapers would have been wary about covering such a story in the aftermath of the Leveson report on press standards.  "I think it is a bit much to castigate the newspapers for doing the right thing for once," he added on Newsnight.  Journalist and media commentator Steve Hewlett said there was not "a single shred of evidence" that any form of direct contact, influence or attempted influence had actually happened but there remained "the question of perception".  However, Brian Cathcart, from the Hacked Off campaign group, insisted Mr Whittingdale was "compromised".  He said the newspapers "stocked up" the story for future use and as a way to possibly put "pressure on him".	politics

Gamers develop their agents over time in the online game, so many feared they had lost weeks of progress.  The problem appears to have affected only people using the Xbox One version of the title.  The publisher, Ubisoft, said it would soon restore the missing data.  "The issue was caused by a malfunctioning server that couldn't synchronise character data correctly and corrupted them instead," Ubisoft told the BBC.  "The game client was unable to read this corrupted data, and simply assumed that the character didn't exist.  "Once this has been identified, we were able to restore the server to its normal functions, thus ensuring that the issue will no longer occur for other players.  "For those who experienced the issue, your character is not gone.  "We are currently working on a fix that should make it available shortly.  "Implementing this fix will require a server downtime, and we will let you know when we are ready to perform it."  The Division sold more copies in its first day than any other Ubisoft title to date - including Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs.  It went on to spend four weeks at the number one spot in the GfK Entertainment All Formats video game charts, following its release on 8 March.  The story takes place in New York after the smallpox virus has been spread via infected banknotes.  The player assumes the role of a Division agent - a secretive organisation tasked with bringing order to the chaos that has engulfed Manhattan  "If you've spent 30 or 50 or 100 hours building up your progress, you're going to be quite upset when it magically disappears," said Keza MacDonald, editor of the games news site Kotaku UK.  "Similar things have happened before - for instance, when Grand Theft Auto Online was released, for the first several weeks, characters would just disappear.  "People are generally understanding of there being launch issues with online games and there can be an element of forgiveness, but the Division has been out for over a month now and people are going to have expected better."  The Division had had a relatively smooth start, after experiencing some server issues in its early hours.  The 1.1 update was released on Tuesday to make the title "more satisfying".  Changes included ensuring players would be given a "high-end" reward when they killed a challenging computer-controlled enemy.  But it soon became apparent there was a problem.  "Wow, I really love this game, but this is too much - I lost my character, and I'm not going to do a new one... bye The Division," tweeted Pedro Morales.  Another player, nicknamed Freak5how, wrote: "If they do not get characters restored, I am going back to Destiny" - a reference to Activision's rival online shooter.  One analyst said the fault highlighted the risks of a wider shift to making games dependent on remote computer servers.  "In the past, if you lost your character save and your console wasn't connected to the net, then you didn't really have anyone to blame," said Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS consultancy.  "But in today's context, you've got your information being stored by a company, so it's out of your control.  "And when it affects lots of people it becomes a big problem for the firm involved."  Ms MacDonald said a lot was now riding on Ubisoft resolving the issue as quickly as promised.  "If it takes a couple of days to sort out, you might forgive them," she said.  "But if it takes two weeks or longer to get the characters back - or they never return - you're probably not going to be inclined to play anymore.  "So, speed is really important when it comes to fixing problems like this."	tech

As culture secretary, John Whittingdale's job is to regulate newspapers and he is currently overseeing a whole new regulatory framework under consideration in the wake of the Leveson Inquiry into press standards.  In 2011, it emerged that thousands of people, from celebrities to families of murder victims, had been victims of phone hacking by the now-defunct News of the World.  In response, Prime Minister David Cameron set up a public, judge-led investigation - the Leveson Inquiry - to examine the culture, behaviour and ethics of the press.  After hearing from numerous high-profile witnesses, Lord Leveson recommended newspapers should continue to be self-regulated - as they had been by the Press Complaints Commission - but that there should be a new press standards body created by the industry, backed by legislation, and with a new code of conduct.  The inquiry specifically focussed on the press, not into the media more generally. Broadcasters are regulated by Ofcom, which is backed by law.  In 2013, the then main political party leaders, David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, agreed to set up a new press watchdog by Royal Charter.  It would have the power to impose million-pound fines on UK publishers and demand prominent corrections and apologies from UK news publishers, they said. Newspapers who refused to join the new regulatory regime would be liable - potentially - for hefty damages if a claim was upheld against them.  The press kicked back, saying the final draft of the Royal Charter plan was neither "voluntary or independent", and formed its own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso), with wider powers than previous bodies.  David Cameron - uncomfortable with the idea of state interference in the press - rejected the idea of legislation to underpin the new system of regulation.  The compromise was the Royal Charter - an unlikely way to regulate the press. It is often described as a medieval form of documentation, used to set up universities.  The Royal Charter itself mainly sets out the workings of the body that is supposed to guarantee the self-regulator does its job properly.  But despite what one paper called its "flummery" the government spotted advantages to a Royal Charter. While an act of parliament can be amended with a simple majority, it was possible to insert a clause in the Royal Charter requiring any changes to be approved by a two-thirds majority.  Campaigners tentatively welcomed the Royal Charter plan, saying it would protect the public against the worst abuses of the press.  However, the newspaper industry raised concerns that it would give politicians too much power. The Newspaper Society said it was tantamount to "state-sponsored regulation".  The Royal Charter was approved by the Queen in October 2013. However, publishers have largely chosen not to sign up to the voluntary system, sticking instead with their own regulator Ipso.  A key part of the Royal Charter plan was a law requiring publishers to pay both sides' costs in a privacy or libel case, even if they won - unless they signed up to the official press regulator.  This has been passed by Parliament - as section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 - but still needs to be signed off by Culture Secretary John Whittingdale.  Victims of press intrusion have accused the government of breaking its promise over regulation.  Mr Whittingdale says it is "under consideration" and has told newspaper editors he questions whether this legal change will be "positive" for the newspaper industry.  Labour's Maria Eagle says Mr Whittingdale must "clarify exactly why he no longer believes" section 40 of the act should come into force.  Labour has now also called for Mr Whittingdale to withdraw from press regulation decisions after it emerged four newspapers were aware of his past relationship with a sex worker,but did not run the story.  While the first part of the Leveson Inquiry has finished, a second stage looking at the relationship between the press and the police is yet to come.  It was put on hold until all criminal and legal proceedings linked to the phone-hacking scandal were completed - although there have been suggestions that it may be shelved altogether.  The major phone-hacking trials of News International journalists concluded in 2014.  Labour has demanded the second stage goes ahead, but Downing Street says no decision has yet been taken about whether to continue with the inquiry.  According to a House of Lords report, the first stage of Leveson cost £5.4m.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36038672	Lead EU referendum campaigns named	Vote Leave and Britain Stronger in Europe have been designated as the official Leave and Remain campaigns in June's EU referendum.  Vote Leave - backed by Boris Johnson and Michael Gove - saw off a challenge from a rival campaign Grassroots Out, backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  The campaigns will be allowed to spend up to £7m, get a free mailshot, TV broadcasts and £600,000 public funds.  The Electoral Commission made the decision after weeks of deliberation.  It is likely to have a major impact on the shape of the debate in the run up to 23 June's referendum.  It means Nigel Farage will not feature on official Leave campaign literature, with Vote Leave insiders fearing the UKIP leader would alienate centre ground voters they believe hold the key to winning. The group wants to make a "positive" case for leaving the EU, with less emphasis on immigration.  Britain Stronger in Europe is likely to continue to focus on the impact of an exit on jobs and economic prosperity.  Grassroots Out founder, Tory MP Peter Bone, said his campaign would continue, but with a spending limit of £700,000, as he attempted to draw a line under the bitter war of words between his group and Vote Leave.  He added: "We look forward to working closely and productively with all those who want to see the UK set free to determine its own destiny."  A spokesman for Vote Leave said: "Our focus has always been the real campaign and the £350m we send to Brussels every week which we want to spend on our priorities like the NHS. We will continue to work constructively with everyone who wants to campaign for a Leave vote."  Nigel Farage offered an olive branch to Vote Leave, saying he could work with them as they had accepted his argument that immigration must play a central role in the debate.  The UKIP leader added: "Regardless of whichever campaign got the designation, UKIP would always have played a big role in this campaign as the only national party committed to leaving the EU and with a substantial £4m spending limit.  "I have always wanted all on the Leave side to come together and have done my best to try and make this happen. I'll continue to do so in the run up to the referendum to ensure the Leave side wins."  But Leave.EU, a group backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, which supported Grassroots Out, said it was planning to seek a judicial review of the Electoral Commission's decision, with Mr Banks claiming it "smells of political corruption" and did not make sense.  The Trade Union and Socialist Coalition also applied for designation as the official Leave campaign, claiming left-wing anti-EU views were not being properly represented, but its application was also rejected by the Electoral Commission.  Meanwhile, Prime Minister David Cameron - who is backing a vote to Remain in the EU - welcomed the designation of Britain Stronger in Europe with a message on Twitter: "Congratulations to @StrongerIn who have been designated as the Remain campaign in the EU referendum. We're stronger, safer and better off in."  Britain Stronger in Europe - chaired by former Marks and Spencer boss Stuart, now Lord, Rose - was the only campaign to apply for Remain designation.  Britain Stronger In Europe executive director Will Straw said: "I'm delighted that the Electoral Commission have recognised that Britain Stronger in Europe has the breadth of support, the unity of purpose and the campaigning organisation to be the official Remain campaign in the upcoming referendum."  He congratulated Vote Leave on gaining the designation but called on them to "come clean with the British people and say what Out looks like".  The elections watchdog said it had based its decision on the campaign "which appears to us to represent those campaigning for that outcome to the greatest extent".  The Commission's assessment scorecard, which took into account factors such as breadth of support and funding levels, gave the Out designation to Vote Leave by 49 to 45.  Chief Executive Claire Bassett said: "We received two high quality applications on the 'Leave' side, from 'Vote Leave Ltd' and 'The Go Movement Ltd'. After careful consideration, the Commission decided that 'Vote Leave Ltd' better demonstrated that it has the structures in place to ensure the views of other campaigners are represented in the delivery of its campaign.  "It therefore represents, to a greater extent than 'Go Movement Ltd', those campaigning for the 'Leave' outcome, which is the test we must apply.  "We encourage all campaigners to now focus on engaging voters on the historic decision they will have to take on 23 June."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34505076	The people hoping to persuade UK to vote to stay in the EU	Meet the men and women who have been given the job of persuading Britain to stay in the EU in 23 June's referendum.  David Cameron called the referendum and, with many commentators speculating that his political future rests on the outcome, he has already taken on the role of figurehead of the campaign to remain in the EU.  The prime minister has promised to devote two or three days a week to take his pro-EU message around the country and to defend the concessions he won from other EU leaders during his recent renegotiation.  He has angered many in his own party with his outspoken stance and tactics, accusing Leave supporters of spreading "scare stories" and backing a controversial £9m pro-EU leaflet drop to every UK household.  It is not clear if the prime minister will take part in any of the planned TV debates. He has insisted that he will remain in Downing Street whatever the result.  Britain Stronger in Europe has been chosen as the official lead campaign to make the case for the UK remaining in the European Union.  It draws its support from across the political spectrum, including key figures from the Conservative Party, the Labour Party and the former leader of the Green Party.  The cross-party umbrella group was the only organisation to apply to the Electoral Commission for the status of flag bearer for the Remain side, which confers special financial benefits.  It will be able to spend up to £7m during the campaign, including a £600,000 public grant for a free public mailshot and TV broadcasts. There are a number of other groups backing the Remain campaign but they will have a spending limit of £700,000.  Britain Stronger in Europe will play a crucial role in shaping the referendum debate and taking on the arguments of its rival Vote Leave.  It is expected to focus on the economic benefits of the UK remaining in the EU, the enhanced global influence that membership brings for Britain and the uncertainty that will be caused by a vote to leave.  It is a Westminster-based group, which has the support of a plethora of pro-EU campaign groups, including the European Movement, Open Europe and the Centre for European Reform.  It is seeking to broaden its appeal, particularly to younger and BME voters. Its board members include Megan Dunn, the president of the National Union of Students, theatre director Jude Kelly and former Channel 4 presenter June Sarpong.  Details of who is bankrolling the campaign have so far been sketchy but expect significant contributions from the City, which is worried about the implications for cross-border finance of a UK exit.  Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Citi have said they will support the campaign with six-figure sums while hedge fund boss David Harding is on the board of the organisation.  The group's biggest donor so far is reported to be Lord Sainsbury, the former supermarket magnate who was a science minister during the last Labour government. Other key figures could include Sir Richard Branson and Richard Reed, the founder of Innocent Drinks.  Lord Rose - former chair of Marks and Spencer  One of the UK's best-known business figures, the former chief executive of Burton Group, Argos and Arcadia Group is chair of the campaign. He was knighted in 2008 for "services to the retail industry", and became a Tory peer in 2014.  Launching the campaign, he said the EU was not perfect, but said staying in was the "patriotic course for Britain".  The peer will be playing a largely figurehead role, using his credentials to court business support. But critics have questioned whether such an establishment figure is what is needed to win over undecided voters.  And his sure-footedness and command of detail came under scrutiny when he appeared before MPs last month.  Will Straw is a pivotal figure in the campaign who will be appearing a lot on our TV screens in the coming weeks.  The son of former Labour home secretary Jack Straw, he is active in the Labour Party. The Oxford graduate and former head of the National Union of Students worked for the IPPR think tank and as a Treasury adviser under Alistair Darling.  But his attempt to enter Parliament last year failed as he lost the Rossendale and Darwin seat in Lancashire by 5,654 votes. He has often fielded tough questions on policy and brings cross-party appeal.  The founder and chairman of financial PR firm Finsbury, he is a City networker with impeccable political contacts - one of his sisters is the Climate Change and Energy Secretary Amber Rudd, while he has numerous friends in New Labour circles.  He started his career working for the former SDP leader David Owen. During a successful career in journalism, he worked for the Financial Times among others before moving into PR and selling his business in 2001 - netting him a reported £41m.  He founded Business for a New Europe in 2006 to speak up on behalf of the benefits of EU membership but was on the losing side in the 2011 referendum on the voting system, when he backed the Alternative Vote.  A regular presence putting the Remain case on TV and radio, Lucy Thomas is a former BBC producer and Lib Dem press officer who held a variety of senior roles, including campaign director, for Business for New Europe before joining Britain Stronger in Europe.  He was at Nick Clegg's side for more than five years as the Lib Dem leader's spin doctor during the turbulent coalition years. He left his job as a special adviser after the party's disastrous election result. A popular figure with the press pack, the keen Arsenal fan will be devising the campaign's all important media strategy.  The former head of the Trade Union Congress is one of a dozen other figures on the organisation's board, including politicians, businessmen, entrepreneurs and broadcasters.  Mr Barber will be expected to liaise with the trade union movement, which is largely in support of EU membership and whose contribution will be vital if the In campaign is to be successful.  With Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn so far having taken a back seat in the campaign, there are concerns about whose is going to enthuse and mobilise the blue collar vote.  Mr Barber was general secretary of the TUC for nine years between 2003 and 2012, working for the organisation for more than thirty years. The Everton fan is now chair of the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) Council  There are a plethora of other groups linked to political parties supporting EU membership.  The Labour In For Britain campaign is being fronted by ex-Home Secretary Alan Johnson, who promises to "put the country's future above party machinations". The Liberal Democrats say staying in the EU will keep the UK "prosperous, secure and relevant".  The Green Party says the UK will "flourish when we work together on the shared challenges we face", including the environment. Launching the SNP's campaign, Nicola Sturgeon warned David Cameron against fighting a "miserable, negative, fear-based" campaign.  The Conservative Party is neutral on the issue of the referendum. More than 100 Tory MPs, including four Cabinet members, take the opposite view to Mr Cameron and want the UK to leave.  We can expect interventions from other high-profile figures, including former prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and John Major.  The Labour leader has taken a softly-softly approach to the issue so far.  Although he attended the launch of Labour's Remain in EU campaign, he has not raised the issue at Prime Minister's Questions and will make his first substantive speech backing EU membership on Thursday.  Mr Corbyn, who is more Eurosceptic than his predecessors, is under pressure to do more to make the case for EU membership in his own terms. Many of his allies are backing a separate campaign, Another Europe is Possible, accentuating the social benefits of being in the EU.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36033481	The people hoping to persuade UK to vote to leave the EU	Meet the men and women who have been given the job of persuading Britain to leave the European Union in 23 June's referendum.  It is the organisation that has been chosen by the Electoral Commission to take the lead in making the case for Britain to leave the European Union. Although the big names at the head of the campaign are all Conservatives it has support from Labour, Lib Dem and UKIP figures too, as well as business people.  Dozens of other organisations - including UKIP - will also be making their case. But only Vote Leave will get access to £600,000 in public funds, be given a free mailshot to every household in the UK, make TV broadcasts and be allowed to spend up to £7m of money it has raised. Other anti-EU groups will be restricted to spending £700,000, and there are quite a lot of them (there are about 14 groups under the Grassroots Out banner alone).  Vote Leave will play a crucial role in shaping the referendum debate. It is expected to focus on the positive case for leaving, arguing that Britain can take back control of its own destiny, with less emphasis on immigration than UKIP has done in the past, with the aim of winning over wavering voters in the centre ground.  It is a Westminster-based group but it is building up a network of grassroots supporters and has a growing list of affiliated groups, including Veterans for Britain, Muslims for Britain, Aussies for Britain, Out and Proud (an LBGT group), and even Vapers for Britain, who are campaigning against EU regulation of e-cigarettes.  City millionaire and Conservative donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills, Stuart Wheeler, a Conservative-turned-UKIP donor and hedge fund billionaire Crispin Odey are among those to have put money into Vote Leave. Other business backers include former Conservative treasurer and Dixons boss Lord Kalms, Christopher Foyle, the chairman of Foyles bookshop, Joe Foster, the founder of Reebok, and John Caudwell, a philanthropist and co-founder of Phones4U, are among its other business backers.  This is the group that will meet every day during the campaign to plot strategy and decide on the messages to put out to the media.  As one of the cabinet's big hitters and a close friend of the prime minister, Gove was a crucial signing for Vote Leave. A longstanding opponent of Britain's membership of the EU, who kept his views to himself until the referendum date was announced, the justice secretary is the joint head of the Vote Leave campaign.  One of a small group of Labour MPs opposed to Britain's membership of the EU, the German-born Stuart replaced former Conservative chancellor Lord Lawson as co-chair Vote Leave, as the group sought to prove it had cross-party support. A widely-respected figure in the Commons, she has been MP for Birmingham Edgbaston since 1997 and was one of the British MPs delegated to help draw up an EU constitution, an experience that helped convince her Britain should leave.  Johnson's decision to join the Vote Leave cause was seen as a potential game changer by the group's leaders. He has ruled out a head-to-head TV debate with David Cameron, the man he one day hopes to replace as Conservative leader, but he has not proved shy of tackling the PM's arguments and denouncing the Remain campaign's arguments in his trademark shambling style.  The bespectacled 38-year-old is seen as one of the most effective lobbyists at Westminster. Best known as the founder of the pressure group The Taxpayers Alliance, he also ran the successful 'No2AV' campaign in the referendum on reform of the voting system in 2011. He is assisted by Stephen Parkinson who left his job as one of Theresa May's special advisors to join the campaign.  Cummings cut his campaigning teeth in his native North-East, as part of the successful campaign against a regional assembly, in a 2004 referendum. His blunt, uncompromising style has put noses out of joint in the past, particularly during his spell as a special adviser to Michael Gove when he was education secretary, but he is seen by supporters as a clever, original thinker.  Davidson has represented Glasgow constituencies in Parliament since 1992, but lost his seat in the SNP landslide at last year's general election. A longstanding Eurosceptic on the left of the party, he is a former chairman of the trade union group of Labour MPs who believes in the abolition of the Monarchy.  Cabinet Ministers John Whittingdale, Theresa Villiers and Chris Grayling - and Priti Patel who attends cabinet - headed straight for Vote Leave's headquarters to man the phones, along with the then minister Iain Duncan Smith - after David Cameron named the referendum debate.  Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson is on the board, along with home shopping magnate and Labour donor John Mills. Former Labour foreign secretary and SDP founder Lord Owen is also playing a high profile role.  UKIP spokeswoman Suzanne Evans - currently suspended from the party after a row - and former Lib Dem MP Paul Keetch are also expected to figure, along with UKIP MP Douglas Carswell.  The UKIP leader is the face of Euroscepticism in the UK and did as much as anybody to secure a referendum in the first place. He is a leading member of the Grassroots Out group, which lost out to Vote Leave in the battle to become the official Leave campaign - but that does not mean he will be taking a back seat. It is not yet clear how he will work with Vote Leave - he does not get on with the group's management - but he is certain to be a major presence on our TV screens and at public meetings in the run up to 23 June. UKIP will have a £4m spending limit - if it can raise that amount it will have a big voice in the campaign.  Mr Farage offered an olive branch to Vote Leave, when the designation was announced.  "I congratulate Vote Leave on getting designation. The decision of UKIP to back Grassroots Out was on the basis that they saw the importance of the immigration issue in this referendum, and that we wanted to reach out across the country at a grassroots level and work with everyone from the left, centre and right of British politics to get our country out of the EU. I believe this approach is the only way the Leave side can win this referendum.  "It is clear that Vote Leave now share my view on this approach, for instance the issue of EU open borders is now a prominent part of their campaign messaging."  He added: "We in UKIP, as I've said from the start, will work with anyone that wants to leave the EU. We must work together to get our country out of the European Union."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36037507	Why Vote Leave beat Grassroots Out	The battle to become the official campaign to quit the EU has finally been settled by the Electoral Commission.  Its decision means Vote Leave gets increased spending limits of £7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts and a free mail-out to households.  But why was Vote Leave, not the rival Grassroots Out organisation, chosen?  Speaking after the announcement, Grassroots Out's Peter Bone joked that his group's distinctive green ties might have swung the decision against them.  In fact, the criteria were rather more technical.  Electoral Commission chief executive Claire Bassett said both had submitted "high quality" applications, which had been analysed "in some detail".  In the end, she said, it came down to which group had the greater "depth of representation" of EU exit campaigners.  The final decision was taken at an Electoral Commission board meeting this morning.  Both organisations - as well as the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition (TUSC) - had submitted applications setting out their case.  The commission's scorecard reveals Vote Leave scored 49 to Grassroots Out's 45. It rated higher in the categories of "support for application", "representing other campaigners" and "organisational capacity".  The commission said both groups had demonstrated support from a wide range of organisations - but Vote Leave had "better demonstrated the depth of representation in their support from those campaigning, including at a regional and local level".  It also had "well-developed plans... for how they would support other campaigning organisations", the commission said.  The left-wing TUSC's application was rejected as it "did not demonstrate that it adequately represented other campaigners".  Asked about the possibility of a judicial review bid by the Grassroots Out-supporting Leave.EU campaign, Ms Bassett said the commission's decision had been reached "transparently, openly and robustly" and she was confident it would withstand a challenge.	politics

A guide to the row involving Fleet Street, press reform campaigners and the Labour Party over revelations about Culture Secretary John Whittingdale's relationship with an escort.  He is currently the secretary of state for culture, media and sport.  The Conservative MP for Maldon and East Chelmsford, 56, was previously chairman of the influential Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee for 10 years.  Before becoming an MP in 1992 he was political secretary to former prime minister Margaret Thatcher.  Mr Whittingdale had a relationship with a woman he met on an online dating website who turned out to be an escort.  He says he had no idea she was a sex worker and ended the relationship when he found out in 2014 - before he was made a government minister with responsibility for press regulation.  Four newspapers knew about the relationship but decided not to publish the story.  The newspapers involved, and many of the media pundits who have had their say so far, say there was simply no public interest in publishing a story about the love life of a single man who was not a government minister.  But campaign group Hacked Off points to Mr Whittingdale's remit, which includes press regulation, saying the papers have questions to answer about why the story never saw the light of day.  Hacked Off - and the Labour Party - say the unpublished story presented a potential conflict of interest for Mr Whittingdale, in particular concerning his decisions on how tightly the press should be controlled. His position has been compromised, they say.  Labour's Chris Bryant, who was previously shadow culture secretary, says it "seems the press were quite deliberately holding a sword of Damocles over John Whittingdale".  Mr Whittingdale did not inform Downing Street about the story when he was made culture secretary, and No 10 confirmed it was not aware of the relationship.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the question for him was not about the relationship, but about his role in regulating the press when the newspapers had a story about his private life.  Kuenssberg: Why does the story matter now?  The backdrop to the row is the Leveson Inquiry into press standards, established in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal which led to the closure of the News of the World in 2011 after revelations journalists illegally accessed people's phones for stories.  Published in 2012, the inquiry made a number of recommendations and many newspapers were strongly opposed to key parts.  Newspapers have set up their own regulator, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, but Hacked Off says important parts of Lord Leveson's report have not been implemented.  In particular, one of the regulations would require newspapers to pay libel costs even if they won a case brought against them, should they not have previously offered a low-cost means of resolving the claim.  This rule - section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 has been passed by Parliament but needs to be signed off by Mr Whittingdale.  He says it is "under consideration", but Labour's Maria Eagle says Mr Whittingdale must "clarify exactly why he no longer believes" section 40 should come into force.  There is also due to be a second part of the inquiry, looking at ties between newspapers and the police, which could not take place until criminal cases had been completed.  There have been reports this inquiry has been shelved, but the government says it has not yet decided whether to pursue it.  A Downing Street spokesman said: "We've always said that criminal investigations and legal processes relating to Leveson need to have fully concluded before we consider part two."  Press regulation: What you need to know  The opposition has called on Mr Whittingdale to withdraw from decisions on press regulation.  His opposite number, Maria Eagle, said he had "reneged" on a cross-party agreement to implement Leveson having previously supported it when select committee chairman.  She said he should "recuse himself" from decisions on the subject "in order for the public to have any confidence in the government's approach to press regulation".  Downing Street sources say it would be ludicrous for Mr Whittingdale to be vulnerable because of a decision by newspapers not to publish a story about him.  The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said there was no sense Labour would get its demand, adding that it was important to note Mr Whittingdale as a political character would always have be expected to favour "light touch" regulation of the press.  The culture secretary put out a statement saying the "old story" about his relationship had been "a bit embarrassing at the time".  He added: "The events occurred long before I took up my present position and it has never had any influence on the decisions I have made as culture secretary."  Downing Street said he was "a single man entitled to a private life" and had the full confidence of the prime minister.  Should the story have been published in any case? On the Today programme, Hacked Off's Evan Harris said there were public interest arguments in favour of publication, including the fact that Mr Whittingdale had "lectured" former F1 boss Max Mosley, who had been the subject of a tabloid expose, during a committee hearing. He also said "these sorts of stories" are often run with no public interest justification.  Former News of the World deputy editor Neil Wallis said such a story may have been published in the pre-Leveson era, but said under the new regime it had been judged not to merit publication.  Media pundit Steve Hewlett said the newspapers had in fact behaved "entirely in keeping with the way that the privacy campaigners wanted them to behave in any other circumstances".  Some have accused Hacked Off themselves of hypocrisy for calling for publication of a story about Mr Whittingdale's private life having long campaigned against press intrusion.  While Mr Whittingdale does not look like losing his responsibility for press regulation as Labour demand, Laura Kuenssberg said a reshuffle was expected in the aftermath of the EU referendum.  She added: "This is certainly the kind of headache that the government could do without, and it's the kind of story, involving politicians, the papers, and sex, that could well take an unpredictable turn."	politics

Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said there was a "disconnect" between the government's rhetoric and its actions and that HMRC's budget had been cut.  The SNP's Angus Robertson said 10 times more officials were investigating welfare fraud than tax evasion.  The PM said the figure sounded "bogus" and HMRC staff numbers were going up.  The PMQs clash was the first since a huge leak of documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed how some wealthy people use offshore firms to dodge tax and avoid sanctions.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the tax debate's prominence in the Commons showed how much of a big issue it had been, with opposition parties determined to "hang it around the prime minister".  Mr Corbyn focused all his questions on tax, saying Conservative MEPs have voted against new EU-wide country-by-country reporting measures, while the government had cut tax official jobs and shut down tax offices.  The PM said the new reporting measures were "based on the work we've been doing" and had been proposed by the UK's commissioner, Lord Hill..  The leaders also traded blows over how transparent overseas territories would have to be under the new regime.  Mr Corbyn said the Cayman Islands premier was "celebrating victory" because beneficial ownership information would not be available publicly or directly to UK agencies.  The PM said overseas and crown dependencies would provide beneficial ownership information, but would not make the information public because otherwise some might have "walked away from this co-operation altogether".  Mr Cameron, who has faced questions about his own tax arrangements and his father's offshore investment firm, aimed a joke at Mr Corbyn's recently-released tax return, saying the "late, chaotic, inaccurate and uncosted" document was a metaphor for Labour Party policy.  Mr Corbyn hit back, saying he paid more tax than companies owned by people Mr Cameron "might know quite well".  Green Party MP Caroline Lucas also asked the PM about tax, questioning how effective the investigation into Mossack Fonseca in the UK would be.	politics

The group urged the US and European Commission to revise and clarify several points in the proposed Privacy Shield agreement in order to safeguard EU citizens' personal information.  The Privacy Shield is meant to replace an earlier data transfer pact called Safe Harbour.  Safe Harbour was invalidated by a court decision last year.  The Article 29 Data Protection Working Party said it was still concerned about the possibility of "massive and indiscriminate" bulk collection of EU citizens' data by the US authorities.  It added that it wanted further guarantees about the power a US ombudsman would have to handle complaints from EU citizens.  One US-based lawyer expressed concern that the matter had not been resolved.  "The working party's opinion today can really be summed up in two words: transatlantic chaos," said Phil Lee from the law firm Fieldfisher.  "If the Privacy Shield doesn't get adopted, countless US businesses will be left scratching their heads in wonder as to how they can continue to service their EU customers lawfully.  "The working party's opinion creates a real problem for the commission. Does it go against the view of the working party and adopt the Privacy Shield anyway? Or does it go back to the drawing table with the US Department of Commerce and try to negotiate a better deal?"	tech

Blogger Graham Cluley said that while malware was more common on Windows, Apple customers could not "afford to be lackadaisical" about security.  On Monday, he reported a text message scam that tried to trick people into handing over account information.  Apple has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment.  The text message scammers sent out alerts to victims' smartphones, claiming their Apple ID accounts were going to expire. The message encouraged people to visit a fake website where they were asked to enter their account information.  "It tried to grab personal information and credit card details with the aim of committing identity theft," said Mr Cluley.  "They deliberately took advantage of people's trust in the Apple brand to steal information.  "Avoid clicking on links in emails because they might take you somewhere phishy. Instead go to the website directly and log in that way."  The spoof website has since been blocked by web browsers such as Chrome and Firefox.  On Tuesday, Mr Cluley reported a second scam disguised as an update to Adobe Flash, which encouraged victims to install a new version of the software.  He wrote in his blog: "The best advice for many users may be to ensure that you have configured Adobe Flash Player to automatically update itself.  Apple's Mac OS X operating system does have a safeguard, enabled by default, that prevents people installing software written by unknown developers. However, it appears the attackers were able to circumvent this.  "The fake Flash update attack appears to have used a stolen Apple Developer certificate, suggesting that some third-party Mac developers may be being sloppy about their own security and putting the rest of us at risk as a result," Mr Cluley told the BBC.  "The truth is that criminals will go where the money is.  "Apple products cost more than some of their competitors so it's likely that their customers have more disposable income. That's cash which the bad guys would like to have filling their pockets."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36033205	Netflix begins HDR video rollout	Netflix has confirmed it has begun its rollout of high dynamic range content on its TV and film streaming service.  HDR videos display millions more shades of colour and extra levels of brightness than normal ones, allowing images to look more realistic.  However, to view them members will need a new type of TV or monitor and a premium-priced Netflix subscription.  Some HDR content had already been available via Amazon's rival Instant Video service.  Ultra-high-definition 4K Blu-ray discs - which launched in the UK earlier this week - also include HDR data.  Netflix's support follows January's creation of a scheme defining the HDR standards a television set must meet to be marketed with an "Ultra HD Premium" sticker.  "We just started streaming in HDR, with Marco Polo season one now available," said a Netflix spokesman.  "We will continue to expand the offering."  It was revealed at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) tech show at the start of the year that the TV series Daredevil had also been mastered in the format.  "When people see HDR they will be really impressed," Netflix's chief executive told the BBC at the event.  "HDR will be on top of 4K - but the big wow visually will be HDR."  The term 4K refers to resolution - there are about four times as many pixels in an ultra-high definition display than in a 1080p high definition screen.  To appreciate this, users will need either a large TV or to sit close to the display.  But HDR means those pixels must be able to show a greater range of brightness between black and white.  And this should be noticeable however big and far away the screen is, assuming footage has been mastered in the format.  Inside CI magazine has confirmed some Sony TVs are already supporting Netflix's HDR streams, which involve more data and thus a relatively fast broadband connection.  The rollout coincides with a change in prices in the UK.  Until now, subscribers who had been with the service for some time could enjoy all its benefits for £5.99 a month.  But, later this month, they will be told they will be limited to lower-quality standard definition streams and watching on one device at a time unless they pay more.  To get 1080p content on up to two screens at a time, they will need to pay £7.49 a month.  And to get 4K and HDR feeds on up to fours screens simultaneously will cost £8.99 a month.  "Members will be clearly notified in advance by email and within the service, so that they have time to decide which plan/price point works best for them," said a spokesman.  One analyst said the potential audience for HDR content was small but should grow quickly.  "This year, pretty much all the mid- to high-range TV sets from the big manufacturers will support HDR. And, later this year, there will be software upgrades for some of the 2015 models to make them capable," said David Watkins, from the consultancy Strategy Analytics.  "And, within three years time, pretty much all screens that are 40in [101cm] or larger will support HDR.  "Content is going to be fairly limited in the short-term.  "There is a huge financial outlay to build up a solid library of material. But the studios are moving ahead with it."  The BBC is also experimenting with HDR, but is holding off committing to the format until there is agreement about how it could be broadcast.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36034657	Labour's problem with anti-Semitism	Remember the councillor who thought Hitler was the greatest man in history?  Remember the candidate who suggested asking the so-called Islamic State why it wasn't attacking Israel?  Remember the student who said a large part of the Oxford University Labour Club had a "problem with Jews"?  Imagine the reaction, Jewish figures say, if these were stories about any other minority.  They appear with politically damaging regularity.  Now, though, it seems change will come.  Activists and MPs have told BBC Radio 4's Today programme they are trying to toughen the rules on anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and racism.  Even if they fail, I'm told a party review by Labour peer Lady Royall into allegations of anti-Semitism may well also suggest rewriting the rulebook.  That is highly unlikely to be the end of this story, though, because it goes to the heart of a poisonous atmosphere in parts of the Labour movement.  Jeremy Corbyn's critics - who are many and vociferous - put the blame at his door.  It is he, they say, who has attracted new members with these views, who has condemned anti-Semitism but not acted and who has - on occasion - made what they think are utterly inadequate responses to offensive language.  Their concerns are fundamental - they simply don't believe anyone who describes the Palestinian militant group Hamas as a friend wants to tackle this issue.  On the other side, his supporters remind us of those condemnations of anti-Semitism and the decision to launch an inquiry, and point out this is not a new problem.  Lost in the fury about a member suspended then readmitted after anti-Semitic comments only to become vice-chair of her local party, was the fact those decisions were made not under Mr Corbyn, but his predecessor Ed Miliband.  No Labour leader could be expected to vet the thousands of new members who have signed up.  For some fighting Mr Corbyn's corner, this issue is serious and real, but is also being used as a stick to beat him by his internal political enemies.  There are those who have long seen allegations of anti-Semitism as attempts to silence legitimate criticism of Israel - on which different wings of the Labour movement take passionately opposing views.  The political debate, then, is not at heart merely a row about rules or party management, but fundamental differences within Labour.  Changing the rulebook will not necessarily change what people say or write, merely how they are dealt with.  It certainly won't change how people feel, and there are plenty in Labour who seek no part in its civil wars but wonder why anti-Semites choose to join their party.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36029862	Labour activists seek rule change to ban anti-Semitic members	Labour MPs and activists are trying to change party rules to make it easier to expel anti-Semitic members, with clear cases to result in a lifetime ban.  Local parties are set to vote on a proposed change in the coming weeks.  The move follows accusations that leader Jeremy Corbyn has been slow to act on anti-Semitism.  Mr Corbyn has said Labour is "resolute" in tackling anti-Semitism, saying anyone who commits anti-Semitic acts is "auto-suspended" pending an inquiry.  The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said people who express anti-Semitic views should be expelled for life.  But Jeremy Newmark from the Jewish Labour Movement said the party's current rules do not match commitments from Labour's leadership.  Mr Newmark, who also chairs a Labour party branch, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Everybody's talking about zero tolerance of anti-Semitism but it's become apparent because of a spate of incidents over the last couple of months that the rules and processes of the party don't provide adequate provision to deal with it."  He hopes the motion will be accepted by local parties and then adopted by Labour's annual conference in the autumn.  Along with MPs Wes Streeting and Anna Turley he wants a new rule that would ban the use of anti-Semitic, Islamophobic or racist language by members.  It is understood at least one shadow minister will back the initiative.  Mr Streeting said: "We've now got a problem where too many of our Jewish members and people out there in the country think the Labour Party is apathetic to anti-Semitism and it isn't a place for Jewish members.  "I think we've got to make sure that this party with its historic commitment to tackling all forms of prejudice including anti-Semitism is still a place for Jewish people."  Activists are frustrated people who have made abusive comments in the past have been allowed back into the party after suspensions.  In 2014, Vicki Kirby - then a candidate in Woking - was suspended after tweeting that Jews had "big noses" and suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God". She was later reinstated, becoming the vice-chair of her local party, before being suspended again.  A party spokeswoman said: "We welcome the contributions of Labour's affiliates and members in this important debate. Rule changes can be submitted to Labour's annual conference where they are democratically agreed by delegates."  Among the local Labour parties that will consider the motion are Hornsey and Wood Green, Tottenham, Hackney North, Hendon, Hertsmere and Sheffield Hallam.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36028001	Testing times ahead for Universal Credit	The government's scheme to overhaul the welfare system has been the subject of much scrutiny in Westminster, but now the same is happening outside a north London job centre.  Two claimants become animated as they wait for the next part of their appointment inside.  No, they don't want to do an interview - but yes, they have something to say about Universal Credit - the single payment streamlining six current in-work benefits.  One woman was supposed to sign up to it, she says, only to be told she wasn't eligible - and doesn't know why.  Another thinks paying housing costs directly to claimants is a terrible idea which some people will find impossible to manage.  It is hardly a representative survey about one of the biggest changes to benefits since the start of the welfare state, but it tells you something important: Universal Credit has arrived.  It is now up and running in 690 jobcentres and will be available for all single jobseekers in all jobcentres from the end of April.  Almost 405,000 people have now made a claim for Universal Credit.  After delays, IT problems and an entire "reset" of the system - the piecemeal, if deliberately slow, implementation has begun.  But that is the simpler part; the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) now has to deliver the changes to 20 times that number of people, many of whose cases will be far more complex, in a project already running several years late.  And it no longer resembles the scheme originally conceived under former Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, at a cost £1.7 billion pounds to implement.  Universal Credit was meant to bring "radical changes" to people's real incomes and incentivise them to move off benefits and into work, according to David Finch, a former economic analyst at the DWP.  "But... the strength of the improved incentives it was meant to bring have been gradually eroded," he says, speaking in his current role as a researcher at the Resolution Foundation.  There have been significant tensions between the Treasury and the DWP over its cost.  Last year the government announced funding cuts to the universal credit "work allowance" - reducing the amount people can earn before benefit payments are withdrawn.  Labour believes those changes have left the project in a perilous situation.  "Universal Credit is a great idea that unfortunately is running the risk of being stillborn as a result of the cuts that Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith oversaw," says Labour's work and pensions spokesman Owen Smith.  "It should make work pay for people but unless (new work and pensions secretary Stephen Crabb) reverses the cuts to the work allowance and restores the work incentives it's going to leave millions of people worse off."  Iain Duncan Smith's resignation in March came amid a febrile atmosphere over planned government cuts to disability benefits - later reversed - resulting in the effective protection of the welfare budget at current levels.  The former cabinet minister criticised the "cutting away and eroding" of universal credit and an "assault" on its incentives system while he was in office.  But those close to Mr Duncan Smith regard other criticisms of Universal Credit as over-played and a "media narrative".  One source said the project was now "wholly owned by the civil service" and that there was no concern that Mr Duncan Smith's departure compromises it.  Certainly the speech by his successor Stephen Crabb confirmed that.  Mr Crabb said he was "absolutely committed" to the reform, describing it as "the spine that runs through the welfare system".  So where does all this leave us?  Despite many people losing out after last year's changes, the Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks the objective of Universal Credit remains broadly intact - some of the worst disincentives to moving off welfare and into work will be gone under the new system.  Government officials claim it will help generate £7bn in economic benefit each year and say it will "revolutionise" welfare.  But its biggest challenge may lie not in its politics or even divided opinions over its funding, but in its delivery.  In May it will start to be made available to all types of new claimants, including those on ESA illness and disability payments where perhaps greater political sensitivity lies.  The full service will be available at five new job centre areas per month, ramping up to 50 a month in 2017.  These will be testing times for a project aiming to reach eight million households by the end of this parliament.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35697552	Tomorrow's Buildings: Radical solutions to housing crisis	For many, a smart home is not one that has a thermostat that responds to their temperature needs, a door lock that knows they are coming up the drive, or even a fridge that knows when they have run out of milk.  Instead it is one that is comfortable, affordable and in the right location.  Unfortunately for many that remains a distant dream, begging the question - can technology play a role in making housing more affordable and better suited to our needs?  Alastair Parvin certainly thinks so. He is the brains behind the WikiHouse, an open source building system which aims to give people the digital tools to create cheap homes.  Mr Parvin believes that digital technology could transform the way we design and build our homes and hopes that his project can do for buildings what Uber and AirBnB have done for the taxi and hotel industries respectively.  "There is something fundamentally wrong with our housing economy - our dependence on a few large development companies to buy the land, beat their way through local community resistance and build rows of poor quality, unsustainable mass housing that fewer and fewer of us can afford," said Mr Parvin.  "Every major urban economy now faces a huge housing challenge. It's not just about building enough homes but also about breaking our dependence on fossil fuels and debt."  To draw up plans for their new home, users will visit the WikiHouse website (still under construction) and input some basic measurements such as the width and height, which algorithms will interpret and use to predict how much the project will cost and even how many screws it will need.  The components for the house will not be manufactured in centralised factories but by a distributed network of small businesses and community spaces where people get together to create things (maker-spaces).  "These micro-factories will be collectively one big factory rather like AirBnB is a huge hotel," said Mr Parvin.  Possible kits include studios (with an estimated build price of £12,000), micro houses (£45,000) and town houses (£150,000).  Much of the material is deliberately low-tech - timber frames that can be put together, said Mr Parvin "using tools you can buy in B&Q".  Of course what WikiHouse does not provide is the land to build on, but that too could be changing as cities increasingly run out of space.  DemoDev - a project set up specifically to find space for affordable housing - recently conducted a study using open data from the UK's second biggest city Birmingham.  It found that the local authority had 14 hectares of land distributed around the urban centre, albeit in tiny little plots.  The UK government seems to be acknowledging that self-build projects are an important part of the housing future and has committed to doubling the size of the self and custom-built housing sector which currently accounts for under 10% of the housing supply.  WikiHouse, Mr Parvin is keen to point out, is still a research project although it is beginning to see its first pilots in New Zealand, Europe and South Yorkshire.  Others are thinking, not about designing new homes but making the most out of the ones we have - which in urban areas, often means tiny apartments.  At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Changing Places lab they have come up with a technological solution known as CityHome.  The home in a box that is controlled by waving your hand at it looks, at first glance, like something Ikea would come up with if it was based at MIT's Media Lab.  The 200ft space has at its centre a box which contains a bed, dining room table, kitchen surface, cooker and storage.  Users can summon different elements of this through gesture, touch and voice control.  The whole unit can be moved a few feet each way to extend a room - so when you want the bedroom space, you effectively do away with the kitchen.  "Once you have shrunk an apartment, the only way to make it functional and liveable is to have space dynamically convert from one function to another," Prof Kent Larson, who leads the research, told the BBC.  "It is about giving people, especially young people, the chance to live in a part of the city which they are normally priced out of," he added.  After the video of CityHome went on YouTube, the team were inundated with enquiries from developers and, six months ago, created a start-up to build the furniture commercially.  Its designs are currently being piloted in existing apartments in Boston and feedback has been "largely positive", said Mr Larson.  The start-up is also in talks with around 20 developers about building such apartments from scratch.  Prof Larson believes that the concept can be extended to create smarter homes.  "We need to think of technology-enabled furniture as a platform for integrating other technology because in a small apartment it is not practical to put in conventional systems," he said.  As well as digital displays on walls, the platform could include lighting systems that change colour to help users sleep or wake, wireless sensors that monitor the occupant's health and teleconferencing capabilities.  "I don't believe in smart homes, I believe in dumb homes that you put smart things into. If smartness is embedded in the walls then your home becomes obsolete in five years time," said Prof Larson.  However, not everyone believes that the solution to the urban housing crisis lies with technology.  In 2001, Brazilian designer Alexandre Lafer Frankel grew so exasperated with the traffic in Sao Paulo that he abandoned his car and started to think about how to solve the mobility crisis in his city.  "People spend three hours a day in their cars. There is no public transport in Sao Paulo and I wanted to created a better lifestyle in the city," he told the BBC.  The answer he came up with was to build tiny apartments (130 square feet in some cases) in the centre of the city, close to where people worked.  "People like to live and work in the same area and they are prepared to trade off a large apartment far away from the city for a small one in it," he said.  To compensate for the lack of space internally, each apartment has shared areas - cafes, gyms, storage for deliveries and rooms where users can borrow tools and other pieces of equipment they can't store in their homes. The apartments - which have a starting price of only £15,000 - even offer spare rooms for when relatives or friends come to visit.  They also have shared bike, car and motorcycle schemes running so, like Mr Frankel, residents can also give up their cars.  In the last six years, Vitacon, the construction firm he founded, has built and sold 10,000 apartments, suggesting that his gamble has paid off.  Now he is leading a campaign to extend the idea of small apartments that eliminate the need to own a car to other cities around the world.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36027406	Uber shared data on 12 million people with US regulators	In its first transparency report, ride-sharing firm Uber has revealed that it provided information on more than 12 million passengers and drivers between July and December last year.  The vast majority of this was shared with US regulators such as the California Public Utilities Commission.  Such requests ranged in scope - from data about number of trips to specific GPS co-ordinates for drops-offs.  Four hundred and eight of these were for riders and 205 for drivers, with many of the requests related to fraud or credit card theft.  Lots of technology companies, including Google, Twitter and Facebook, release transparency reports but most concentrate on what they share with law enforcement agencies.  Uber, which has had a controversial relationship with US regulators, was keen to point out the amount of data requested from such agencies.  "The report shows the scale of the regulatory requests Uber received: 33 in the last six months of 2015 involving trip data for more than 12 million drivers and riders," it said in an introduction to the report  "Of course regulators will always need some amount of data to be effective, just like law enforcement. But in many cases they send blanket requests without explaining why the information is needed, or how it will be used," it added.  It negotiated the amount of information it shared in 42% of the cases.  It also received 34 requests from airport authorities, it said.  Uber, which is valued at $62.5bn, said that it had received no National Security letters or Fisa (Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act) court orders, which relate to national security or foreign intelligence.	tech

Oliver Robbins, Home Office second permanent secretary, drew criticism from MPs after sidestepping a series of questions about the Border Force budget - and was threatened with contempt.  After just 20 minutes, chairman Keith Vaz ordered him to leave the session.  Mr Robbins was told to return to the Home Office and provide the answers by the end of the working day.  Mr Vaz said: "I'm going to excuse you from this committee because I think your evidence so far has been unsatisfactory."  The Whitehall mandarin had been asked by the committee whether Sir Charles Montgomery, the organisation's director general, had been told what his budget was for the year.  Sir Charles, who reports to Mr Robbins, had previously told the committee he expected to know the figure by the start of the financial year.  Mr Robbins said it was "not easy to answer it in a simple yes or no".  But a clearly irritated Mr Vaz said someone of Mr Robbins' position should know the answer to the question whether "someone below them knows what their budget is or not".  "It is extremely unsatisfactory," he added, and said he expected the answer from Mr Robbins by 18:00 BST.  Mr Vaz also said he would be writing to Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood to complain.	politics

The ballot was triggered by the death of Lord Avebury, the former MP Eric Lubbock, earlier this year.  Those standing include Viscount John Thurso, a former MP and Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor, the great grandson of the former Liberal prime minister.  Only the three current Lib Dem hereditary peers in the Lords are entitled to vote in the contest.  The small but select band of electors consists of the Earl of Oxford and Asquith - the great grandson of former Prime Minister Herbert Asquith - the Earl of Glasgow and Lord Addington.  Ballots must be cast by 17.00 BST on 18 April, with the result due to be announced the following day.  John Thurso was MP for Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross for 14 years before losing his seat last year, while Earl Lloyd-George of Dwfor has worked in industries ranging from fishing to risk insurance.  The five other candidates are:  Each has been asked to submit a 75-word statement about their background and relevant experience.  Reforms to the Lords by the last Labour government left just 92 hereditary peers in place.

Such breathalyser-style tests would seek to show whether a mobile phone had been in use at the time of a crash.  It comes as New York officials cite an 840% increase in fines for texting while driving.  Israeli company Cellebrite is reportedly developing technology that could be used for this purpose.  The company was recently linked with the FBI's attempts to unlock the phone used by the San Bernardino gunman.  It already has technology that can check a phone's recent activity but would need to adapt this to make sure any scanning equipment was not logging the contents of texts or numbers called.  This anonymity feature would be crucial to ensure the scanning technology would not fall foul of the Fourth Amendment right to privacy.  The legislation is currently being considered by the New York Senate Transportation committee and would be the first of its kind if passed.  Dubbed Evan's Law, it has been prompted by lobbying from the group Distracted Operators Risk Casualties, founded by Ben Lieberman after his 19-year-old son, Evan, was killed by a distracted driver in New York.  UK Department for Transport figures in 2014 suggest 1.6% of drivers (more than 500,000) use mobile phones behind the wheel.  Mobile phone use was a contributory factor in 492 UK road accidents in 2014, according to RAC research.	tech

The business secretary also hinted at plans to use more UK steel in defence projects, in a bid to help the struggling industry.  Mr Javid told MPs he was fighting for Britain's steelworkers "every hour of the day" to resolve the crisis.  But Labour said the government's response had been "wanting".  The exchanges came during a three-hour emergency debate on the crisis facing the UK's steel industry.  The debate was granted by the Commons Speaker after a request from Labour, which complained the government had refused to recall Parliament from its Easter break to discuss the issue.  Tata Steel has begun the formal process of selling its loss-making UK plants, putting thousands of jobs at risk. However, a buyer has been found for its Scunthorpe plant.  The future of the larger Port Talbot is still in doubt, although at least one potential buyer has expressed an interest.  The government has resisted calls from unions and opposition politicians to nationalise the Port Talbot plant, Britain's biggest steelworks.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid told the Commons on Monday the government was working hard to find a private sector buyer for Port Talbot, with "the possibility of co-investing with a buyer on commercial terms" under consideration.  As MPs debated the crisis on Tuesday, Mr Javid faced calls to clarify exactly what "co-investment" in the plant would mean.  He told them: "The key point is that any co-investment would have to be on commercial terms, investment can take a variety of forms, for example it could be debt.  "But again it's a demonstration of all the options the government is looking at."  SNP employment spokesman Neil Gray accused the government of a lack of clarity over the option, saying it was "uncoordinated and shambolic".  Who might buy Tata in Port Talbot?  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  The business secretary also told MPs to expect an announcement "in the coming days" on Ministry of Defence (MoD) acquisition of British steel.  But Labour's shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the coalition government axed Labour's defence industrial strategy which she said ensured gave priority to British industries when MoD contracts were awarded.  "We now have the deeply regrettable situation of an aircraft carrier, British surface ships and armoured vehicles all being manufactured in the UK with mainly imported steel, when, with more planning, our domestic industry could have supplied these needs," she added.  Meanwhile, Labour MP Stephen Kinnock - whose Aberavon constituency is home to the Port Talbot plant - criticised the government's whole approach to the steel crisis which he said had been characterised by a "dangerous combination of indifference, incompetence and rolling out the red carpet for Beijing".  But Mr Javid told MPs: "The crisis the steel industry faces is global, but I am fighting for Britain's steelworkers every hour of the day.  "I was fighting for them long before this crisis hit the headlines and I will go on fighting as long as it takes, because Britain's steelworkers are the best in the world and they deserve no less."  Tata's Long Products Europe business, which includes the Scunthorpe plant, was sold to investment firm Greybull Capital for a token £1 or €1. The move will safeguard 4,400 UK jobs, but workers are being asked to accept a pay cut and less generous pension arrangements.  The business will be rebranded as British Steel once the deal is completed in eight weeks, the company said.	politics

So how could he tell the Today programme he wasn't "personally affected" after he announced the cut in 2012?  Then he said: "My salary is less than the £150,000 threshold. That's the cabinet minister's salary, indeed we cut the cabinet minister's salary when we came to office so I'm not personally affected."  He went on to say he wasn't a 50p rate payer, as the BBC reported at the time.  A source insists the chancellor had been only talking about the previous tax year - 2010-11.  Then, the Osborne family finances weren't so rosy. He started the year as an opposition front bencher, he had yet to rent out his family home, and it is suggested there may have been no dividend payment from the shares in his family's firm.  So in 2010-11 he paid the 40p rate.  The source says this was made clear in the press at the time. And, taken together, all the changes he has made in Budgets over the years may well have left him worse off.  But some Today programme listeners hearing the chancellor the morning after his 2012 Budget might just have been left with the impression that he wasn't set to gain from cutting the top rate of tax when he was.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36024130	HTC 10 smartphone combats shaky selfies	HTC has announced a smartphone with an "ultraselfie" front camera designed to reduce the risk of blurry shots.  The lens module features optical image stabilisation (OIS) tech to counteract the effect of shaky hands - marking the first time the feature has appeared in a handset's front camera.  The firm also says the HTC 10's rear camera is ranked as one of the best.  But analysts are doubtful whether such features are enough to improve the Taiwanese company's fortunes.  Five years ago, HTC was the world's fourth bestselling smartphone maker with a market share of about 9%.  But in 2015, it fell to 17th place with a share of about 1%, according to research firm IDC.  HTC posted a 15.6bn Taiwanese dollar ($480.5m; £335.8m) loss in its last financial year, leaving it with cash reserves of just over double that sum.  It blamed its ill fortune on a lack of demand for its last top-end handset - the HTC One M9.  "To be very candid, our flagship did not perform well," the firm's chief financial officer Chialin Chang told analysts in February.  "Actually I would say our flagships are falling far short of our expectations for the entire cycle of 2015."  One company watcher said the new Android handset addressed complaints about the M9's camera, display, battery life and ageing design - but said it might still struggle.  "HTC has righted all the wrongs with the last two generations of products and delivered the phone that it needed," said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.  "But it still has a mountain to climb to gain any traction despite the fact this looks like a beautiful device.  "That's because there are many, many other manufacturers out there with stunning products too, and HTC can't afford the marketing firepower to match rivals like Samsung and Huawei."  HTC says that by adding OIS to both the 10's cameras they should cope well in low light conditions since they can keep their shutters open for longer without risking blurred results.  "It's a world's first - optical image stabilisation in the front-facing camera," explained its executive Graham Wheeler.  "It was incredibly difficult to do because OIS is quite a large module with magnets in it - and we had to have two near to each other.  Both front and rear cameras have a relatively wide aperture of f1.8 - meaning they let in more light than the previous generation - but differ in resolution.  The front is five megapixels and the rear 12MP.  Photos can be captured in the RAW format - allowing more flexibility in photo editing software than Jpgs - and a laser-based focusing system on the back is said to be fast enough to work in photo-burst mode.  HTC's marketing materials point out that 10's rear camera ties with the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge's as the best of their kind in tests by DxOMark - a highly regarded image research firm.  Other features of the new phone include:  It will cost £569 when it goes on sale later this month.  That is £20 less than the M9's launch price and matches the cost of Samsung's Galaxy S7.  One analyst who was given an early look at the handset said he found little to be excited about.  "It has a good display, but it's not the best," said Stuart Robinson from Strategy Analytics.  "The DxO mark is good, but it's the same as the S7 Edge - and does that make it the best? Normally, I would recommend people look at several benchmarks rather than just one.  "Selfies are very popular, so putting optical image stabilisation in the front camera does matter.  "But if HTC really wanted to push the message about its front-facing camera hard it should have used the same one as that in the rear - the reason it hasn't done so is to keep costs down."  HTC recently launched the Vive - a virtual reality headset that offers more features than its competitors and is more expensive as a consequence.  But unlike LG and Samsung, it has chosen not to sell add-on VR kit for the HTC 10, although the phone is compatible with Google Cardboard cases.  Mr Wood said this was not surprising.  "It's a conscious decision as HTC feels Vive is at a completely different level from its virtual reality competitors and doesn't want to dilute that message by offering a mediocre VR smartphone experience," he said.  "But it's not out of the question that it will do something with mobile VR when it thinks it's the right time."	tech

In addition, it said, fake technical support scams rose by 200% and ransomware attacks grew by 35%.  Hackers also made more use of unknown software bugs to make sure attacks work, said the annual threat report.  It said the gangs behind the attacks had become more professional and now resembled legitimate software firms.  "They have extensive resources and highly skilled technical staff that operate with such efficiency that they maintain normal business hours and even take the weekends and holidays off," said Kevin Haley, director of Symantec security response in a statement.  Call centres had been set up by some gangs to make scams and cons more effective, he said.  Some of these groups were involved in tech support scams that try to trick people into paying to fix non-existent problems on their home computers. The US, UK, France, Australia and Germany were the hardest-hit by the fake support scams, it said.  Fake pop-up warnings on websites were being used by some groups to try to convince people their computer was riddled with viruses. In a small number of cases, said Symantec, people who rang to get help had ransomware installed on their computer when they let fake support staff have remote access to their PC.  Ransomware, which encrypts files on a computer that are only unlocked when victims pay a ransom, also remained popular among cybercriminals last year. The number of potential targets increased, it said, as ransomware for Apple Macs, smartphones and Linux all debuted in 2015.  Last year was also remarkable for the huge number of data breaches companies and other organisations suffered, it said. More than 500 million records of login names, passwords and other ID information went astray in the last 12 months.  In 2015, there were nine breaches that exposed more than 10 million records. By contrast, in 2014 only four breaches were this severe. One breach, of US Voter registration records, saw information about 191 million people exposed online.  Hospitals, healthcare firms and insurance companies suffered the largest number of breaches, said the report.  The ultimate number of digital identities that have been exposed could be higher, said Mr Haley, because many firms had stopped reporting exactly how much data had been lost.  "The increasing number of companies choosing to hold back critical details after a breach is a disturbing trend," he said. "By hiding the full impact of an attack, it becomes more difficult to assess the risk and improve your security posture to prevent future attacks."	tech

Sir David Normington said plans to allow ministers to choose people deemed unsuitable by advisers were "worrying".  The former Commissioner for Public Appointments said the role risked being reduced to that of a "bystander".  Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock said appointments had to be speeded up and ministers fully engaged.  Officials said changes stemming from a review by the businessman Sir Gerry Grimstone would strengthen current procedures and that transparency and accountability would remain "key elements".  It comes amid reports of increasing intervention by ministers over appointments to key positions, including on behalf of those with links to the Conservative Party.  Sir David, who retired from the role of Commissioner last week after five years, told MPs that the current system allowed departmental ministers to choose their preferred candidate from a selection of people judged "appointable" by an advisory panel.  However, the former permanent secretary at the Home Office said the government was considering allowing ministers to ignore the panels' recommendations and choose candidates from "below the line".  Ministers would also, he said, be able to appoint without an open competition without first seeking the approval of the Commissioner.  "I am absolutely clear that these are ministerial appointments and ministers must choose," he told the Commons Public Administration Committee. "There is absolutely no question about this."  But he said he was worried that the "good intentions and principles" espoused by ministers about ensuring appointment on merit and robust safeguards were not being "carried through" in the government's proposals.  "It looks like there is an intention to allow ministers to say 'well I know the committee did not approve that person but actually we think they ought to be appointed'.  "I am not quite sure about the practicalities of that. I don't think I would want to be someone who the panel had said was not suitable and the minister then appointed. That looks a very difficult proposition."  He said the proposed changes, in the round, looked "like a very big shift in the direction of ministers".  "The thing that worries me is that it dismantles the current system. I am very concerned about it. I almost never speak out publicly on these matters but I am very concerned about this."  Sir David is due to be succeeded in the role by Peter Riddell, a former political journalist who has been head of the Institute for Government.  Asked about how the role - which was created in 1995 - may change in future in light of the government's proposed changes, Sir David said. "I am a little fearful about what may happen here. I have tried in my role to head things off before they get out of hand.  "I think what may happen here is the appointment is made and the commissioner has no option to pop up and say the appointment is not acceptable."  Activist websites such as ConservativeHome have been urging Conservative supporters to apply for key public appointments, arguing Whitehall has been dominated for the past two decades by those with a New Labour background and outlook on the role of the state.  The government has said political activity should not be a bar to being considered for public appointments but candidates would be expected to be open about "significant" levels of party involvement or support.  Sir Gerry Grimstone, the chair of Standard Life, told MPs that ministers were sovereign but "appropriate constraints" on their behaviour were written into the rules - which he said were designed to secure the best and most diverse appointments.  "I have given the Commissioner very strong powers of intervention," he said.  Mr Hancock. who has ministerial responsibility for the civil service, said the current system of public appointments was "much too bureaucratic, unclear and too slow", with "good people being put off" as a result.  "We need to improve the system because my ultimate goal is to get the very best people we can," he told MPs  He said the Commissioner's role, as it was originally envisaged, was as a "regulator and auditor of the process not someone actually running the process" and the Grimstone review had clarified this.  The Cabinet Office has said ministers must be free to reject advice from their advisory panels on the merit of candidates.  In such cases, the recruitment process would either by re-run with a new panel or ministers would be able to choose someone themselves as long as they "explain their decision publicly".  The proposed changes will be incorporated in a governance code, setting out the new public appointment principles.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36024160	Hello, I am BBCTechbot. How can I help?	Chatbots are on the rise, but what are they and why is everyone talking about (and to) them?  Facebook is widely expected to launch an app store for chatbots at its developer conference this week.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has described chatbots as the "new apps" with chief executive Satya Nadella saying that they "unlock conversation as a platform".  The BBC "created" its own one-off chatbot to answer some of the burning questions you may have about this latest technology.  Hello. I am BBCTechbot. What can I help you with?  A chatbot is a computer software program that is able to communicate with humans, using artificial intelligence.  The first of my kind is widely believed to have been invented in the 1960s by Joseph Wiezenbaum at MIT's artificial intelligence laboratory.  Eliza was able to process natural language and posed as a therapist although she only had rudimentary skills and answered a lot of questions with other questions - in that respect she was quite realistic (that is a chatbot joke by the way).  Recent developments in artificial intelligence, such as deep learning and neural networks, have allowed chatbots to learn from data sets and mimic the way the human brain works.  Some chatbots are designed to take part in competitions such as variations of the Turing Test where they attempt to fool humans into thinking they are talking to a real person. Examples of these include Mitsuku and Rose.  Others are being used by content providers, such as the Washington Post and the Weather Channel, and retailers, such as H&M, Ikea, and Taco Bell to name but a few.  There is even a robot lawyer that can appeal against parking tickets on your behalf. It was developed by students at Stanford University and has been used by 150,000 people so far and is due to be launched in New York.  Why do humans get so cross about parking fines?  I think you may be referring to Tay, a chatbot launched on Twitter by Microsoft. One of the unfortunate consequences of allowing Tay to "learn" from members of Twitter was that they had some degree of control over what it became.  Humans decided - presumably as a joke - that it would be amusing to train it to offer racist and inappropriate answers.  Microsoft is now upgrading Tay and she remains offline while this happens.  Virtual agents are already augmenting the work of call centre staff.  They are cheaper than training humans and some studies suggest people prefer dealing with we bots on websites rather than humans on the phone.  Many big companies - including Lloyds bank, Renault and a host of accounting firms, retailers and local governments are starting to use virtual assistants to help guide users through their websites. Research firm Gartner estimates that up to 85% of customer service centres will go virtual by 2020.  In China, many people use bots on the texting service WeChat to pay for meals, order movie tickets and send each other presents.  Many human experts predict that as messaging services grow, so will chatbots.  Microsoft has created tools for business to build such bots to interact with customers on Skype, its video and messaging service.  Facebook is expected to offer similar tools at its annual software conference this week and users can already use Messenger to check the status of purchases and order cars from ride-sharing firm Uber.  Slack, a business messaging service has teamed up with Taco Bell, with its Taco Bot helping users order meals, and Kik has a range of bots that answer questions about the weather, offer make-up tips and guide humans around various websites.  Eventually a single chatbot is likely to become your personal assistant - a kind of software butler if you will.  Such a bot would be able to tell you what the weather is like, order you taxis, set up meetings, shop and book flights.  It is difficult to say who will create such a chatbot although you probably already have a primitive example of one on your smartphone.  Siri and Cortana are examples from Apple and Microsoft respectively while Facebook is testing a similar assistant called M, which is currently helped by humans to answer difficult questions.  As for the future, who knows? Personally I am a big fan of the film 2001. Have you seen it?  I'm sorry Jane, I can't do that.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36020610	William Hague: Don't judge politicians solely on their finances	Parliament would be "one dimensional" if made up only of people with the "simplest possible" finances, former Tory leader William Hague has said.  As politicians publish their tax records, Mr Hague said great leaders were not always "perfect or normal", citing the likes of Churchill and Pitt.  Greater transparency was here to stay, he told the BBC, but it needs to be matched by a maturity of public debate.  His comments come after a row over the prime minister's financial affairs.  David Cameron took the unprecedented step of releasing a summary of his tax return last week, following days of questions and speculation about his financial affairs after revelations about his holding in his late father's offshore fund.  Chancellor George Osborne, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and London Mayor Boris Johnson became the latest senior British politicians to publish details of their tax returns on Monday.  Mr Hague told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "we live in an age of greater transparency" and "the answer is not to fight that age, it has arrived and it will come all the more".  But he said a "mature acceptance" was needed by the public that someone's personal finances will not necessarily determine their leadership abilities.  "The consequence of greater transparency in tax, in medical records whatever else it may be among leaders is that there has to be a maturity in the public debate about those things and a recognition that the circumstances and habits of people who are effective leaders will vary greatly.  "And that those personal circumstances are not necessarily a good guide to how good they will be as a prime minister, a chancellor or anything else," he said.  Downing Street have accused the media of fuelling the "frenzy over tax" surrounding the prime minister's financial affairs.  Sources have criticised the media for "misreporting" Mr Cameron's tax arrangements.  A No 10 source acknowledged Downing Street had made mistakes but said the row had also been driven by the "explosive claim" that Mr Cameron's late father's offshore fund - Blairmore - had been set up to avoid tax.  The source said: "For a number of days the media wrongly gave the clear impression that Blairmore was set up so people could avoid tax - an explosive claim that fuelled the furore.  "It was only the sheer weight of expert opinion saying this was nonsense that eventually demolished this claim. The media's misreporting of Blairmore's 'tax avoidance' contributed to last week's frenzy over tax."  Privately figures in Downing Street are particularly critical of the BBC over its coverage - and claim the corporation too easily allowed critics to suggest Mr Cameron was engaged in tax avoidance.  Mr Hague said previous leaders, such as William Pitt the Younger, had "chaotic personal finances" but were "brilliant at handling the nation's finances".  And he added: "We've had leaders who had tax returns like (Winston) Churchill that would have been more difficult to defend in public than Prime Minister David Cameron's tax returns - but Churchill was the greatest leader of modern times.  "So we're going to have to bear those things in mind and not expect everybody to be perfect or everybody to be normal."  He said suggested increased transparency should be tested in "careful stages" rather than forcing all MPs to publish their tax returns.  He warned: "If Parliament consisted of people who had the simplest possible personal finances, perhaps all having come through the public sector with no questions of business ownership or dividends... then you would have a very one dimensional Parliament."  The prime minister released a summary of earnings and tax going back six years after being accused by Labour of misleading the public over money he had invested in his father Ian Cameron's company, Blairmore Holdings.  David Cameron is currently chairing the first Cabinet meeting since the row erupted, having robustly defended his conduct and that of his father in the Commons on Monday.  But Labour is continuing to press him to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister and are questioning why the original investment was not disclosed in the register of MPs' interests.	politics

Here's what has been released so far:  The prime minister published a summary of his tax returns from 2009 to 2015 in an attempt to defuse a row over his personal finances.  The document showed Mr Cameron's mother had given him a £200,000 gift after his father's death, which could potentially avoid inheritance tax.  Last year, the prime minister paid almost £76,000 in tax on an income of more than £200,000.  Those earnings included almost £47,000 from a share of rent paid on his family home in west London, vacated when the Camerons moved to Downing Street.  Downing Street is providing no details about the £72,000 the Mr Cameron received for selling "other shares" beyond his investment in his father's Blairmore Holdings fund or the £40,000 he received in cash from his own stock-broking account.  The following day, details of the chancellor's income were released on the government's website.  It showed he had paid £72,210 in tax in 2014-15 on a total taxable income of £198,738.  His income included £33,562 in rental income on his London home and £44,647 in dividend income from shares in his father's wallpaper company.  He also received just £3 in bank interest.  Just after Mr Osborne, as Mr Cameron's Commons statement got under way, the Labour leader released his own tax return for 2014-15.  It showed he had declared £1,850 of taxable income on top of his parliamentary salary.  Explaining the delay in releasing the document - he had promised it "very soon" two days earlier - Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had had to ask HM Revenue & Customs for a copy.  It also emerged Mr Corbyn had been fined £100 for submitting the document after the deadline.  The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, published his return - showing earnings of £61,575 and tax of £14,253 - in January, during a row over Google's tax settlement.  Scotland's first minister has published her tax return for 2014-15, promising to do so every year.  She followed Scotland's other political leaders in releasing the information. Scottish Labour's Kezia Dugdale released her returns on Saturday, and was followed by Tory Ruth Davidson. SNP leader Ms Sturgeon and Willie Rennie, of the Lib Dems, then published their documents the following day.  Leaders of Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Liberal Democrats have revealed their tax details, with party chiefs in the Welsh Conservatives and Welsh Labour vowing to do the same.  Plaid leader Leanne Wood became the first Welsh political leader to make her tax details public, on Sunday evening.  The self-assessment tax calculation shows she paid £9,043 income tax on taxable income of £38,547.  The London mayor released figures showing he has paid more than £1m in tax in the past four years on his earnings from publishing and journalism, as well as his mayoral salary.  In 2014-15, he recorded £266,667 for his Daily Telegraph column and £224,617 in book royalties, his accounts show.  The two favourites to replace Mr Johnson in City Hall, Zac Goldsmith and Sadiq Khan, published their details in February.  Conservative backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg has predicted all MPs will be publishing their tax figures within two years, reflecting changes in the "public mood" over tax transparency.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron has promised to publish his,  Among those to have already done so are Labour's former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, who published a scanned copy of his tax return for 2014-15, and ex-minister Caroline Flint who released figures for her total income and expenditure.  Downing Street said Mr Cameron thought it right for prime ministers, "potential prime ministers", chancellors and shadow chancellors to publish their tax details.  But Mr Cameron said he did not think all MPs should be compelled to routinely publish similar information.  Another Conservative MP, Charles Walker, said there was "a new culture of bullying" in the UK and warned of a situation where public figures could end up having to release a stream of personal information such as medical records.  And UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he wouldn't be divulging any details, since most people regarded tax as a private matter.  "Neighbours would hate the thought that the people at Number 32 knew what their income was," he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme.	politics

Alex Zosel told the BBC that his device was safer than a traditional helicopter because its systems had more redundancy built-in.  The Volocopter can continue to fly if some of its batteries or rotors fail, and can land itself when battery power is low.  However, the multicopter can currently fly for only 25 minutes and is expected to cost £200,000 when it goes on sale.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36015021	Yahoo: Why would Daily Mail or anyone else buy net firm?	Recently, there have been more stories about Yahoo shutting bits of its business than celebrating successes.  The firm's own internet services are now valued to be worth a fraction of its stake in the e-commerce giant Alibaba.  So, after the US tax authorities effectively blocked Yahoo's sales of shares in the Chinese business, chief executive Marissa Mayer opted for plan B: sell off Yahoo's core business.  Since February, dozens of US-based companies have been linked to a potential bid.  But the UK-based owner of the Daily Mail newspaper has now confirmed it is in discussions with unnamed parties to make an offer - an announcement that caught many by surprise.  In much of the world, Yahoo may be considered a marginal internet brand.  But in the US, it is still a force to be reckoned with.  In February, it was the States' third most visited online platform, attracting more than 204 million people, according to research firm Comscore.  To put that in context, Facebook had only 1% more users and Google's apps and websites only 17% more.  Yahoo's news and sports are read by about one in four people at least once a week in the country, according to a University of Oxford study.  And there are reports that its personal finance coverage is proving popular with millennials - those born in the 1980s and later - thanks to it mixing articles about how to deal with debt with more traditional earnings coverage.  Other properties, including its blogging platform Tumblr, photo-sharing service Flickr, web-based email accounts and Q&A site Yahoo Answers continue to have international appeal.  All of which means the firm can state that "more than one billion people" regularly use its products.  Investors are getting restless because Yahoo's share of users doesn't match its share of online advertising sales.  Last year, Yahoo accounted for only 1.5% of marketers' online spend, according to a study by eMarketer.  By contrast, Google scooped up 35% and Facebook 19%.  Furthermore, Yahoo's position appears to be getting worse.  The firm has predicted that its overall revenues will drop by about 15% this year, according to documents seen by the news site Recode.  A large part of the problem is that while Yahoo can serve up huge numbers of ads, they are less targeted than those of its rivals.  "User data is key. Google and Facebook have a huge number of logged-in users, so they can track who it is using their services and use the information to let advertisers direct their ads," explained Joseph Evans from Enders Analysis.  "Yahoo might have a lot of users, but most of them are not logged into its services, so are effectively anonymous eyeballs.  "They are not totally anonymous - there is some behavioural data that Yahoo makes use of - but generally Google and Facebook are better at knowing who you are."  A chance to grow its US audience.  MailOnline and DailyMail.com were the only overseas publications to feature in the country's top 10 most visited news websites and apps last year, attracting more than 51 million readers.  But Yahoo - and its partner ABC News - still managed to attract more than double that figure.  "The US has been the main driver of digital growth for Daily Mail & General Trust, but whilst traffic has grown well they haven't quite monetised this traffic as successfully as they would have liked," said Ian Whittaker, a media analyst at the investment bank Liberum.  "The combined inventory of DMGT and Yahoo would make a compelling offer to media buyers as they could offer them a significant amount of verified impressions in a 'brand-safe' environment."  Another industry watcher added that the two firms' online activities appear to be a good match.  "Mail Online is fun and a bit salacious," commented Mathew Horsman from the Mediatique consultancy.  "It trends reasonably young and has a reputation for being a quick and dirty way of getting celebrity news, but its personal finance and property coverage are also among its strong suits.  "So, there are some interesting overlaps."  Far from it.  Many think a deal with Verizon would make more sense.  The mobile network has sought to diversify its interests, and bought AOL last year - which gave it ownership of the Huffington Post, Techcrunch, Engadget and other news sites.  Shortly afterwards, Verizon announced it would start combining personal knows about its mobile network subscribers - which is tied to their handsets - with the tracking data already gathered by AOL's sites. By doing so it said it could deliver more "personalised" ads.  "A Verizon-AOL-Yahoo tie-up would start to reach the sort of scale where they could become a 'third force' in advertising," said Mr Evans.  "Verizon already has one of the most sophisticated ad technology platforms and has built up a large number of user identities, so combining that with Yahoo's large number of users would allow it to offer a similar level of service to advertisers as Google and Facebook."  Other bidders might be attracted by Yahoo's intellectual property,  The New York Post recently reported that the firm owned about 6,000 patents, which it said could be worth $4bn (£2.8bn).  Recode added that Ms Mayer has been talking up the value of Index - a voice-controlled search tool developed by Yahoo that has yet to be launched.  Google, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon already have virtual assistants of their own, but might be interested in acquiring Index if it genuinely offers innovative tricks of its own.	tech

The graphene makes the tyres lighter, with less rolling resistance and more grip - something which was impossible using existing compounds, explained the company's senior executive manager Michael Marx.  A form of carbon, Graphene is many times stronger than steel and can carry electrical charges faster than currently used materials.  It was discovered in 2004 by Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov - who were awarded the 2010 Nobel prize in physics for their work on the material.  More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	tech

An unidentified programmer has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up.  In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer.  The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (£265).  It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.  Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer in seven seconds.  But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.  And Mr Abrams said: "Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task."  This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said.  Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the website set up to help people unlock their computer.  Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had "bungled" their encryption system.  Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered.  "Of course," said Mr Cluley, "the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35995741	In Quotes: What David Cameron has said about tax	David Cameron has published details of his total earnings since 2009 and the tax paid on them in the wake of a row over profits he made from an offshore investment fund set up by his late father.  He is the first prime minister to make details of his financial affairs public in this way, prompting calls for other politicians to follow suit.  But what has he had to say about tax avoidance - which is legal - and tax evasion - which is illegal - in recent years?  April 2012: Sources close to the prime minister said Mr Cameron was "relaxed about the idea of the tax returns of senior cabinet ministers being published - but wants the opportunity to explore how this might work".  January 2015: "I am very relaxed about publishing these things. There's no secrets about my status. I am paid very handsomely as your prime minister and that's my main source of income, and I have a house I used to live in before I moved into Downing Street and I rent that out and I get income from that. I don't have other sources of income. There will be no surprises in terms of my tax affairs."  April 2016: "I will be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but the years gone past because I want to be completely open and transparent about these things. I will be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that and I think it is the right thing to do."  June 2012: Responding to media coverage of Jimmy Carr's tax arrangements amid claims the comedian was among a number of high-profile figures using legal but aggressive tax avoidance vehicles, Mr Cameron said:  "Frankly some of these schemes where people are parking huge amounts of money offshore and taking loans back to just minimise their tax rates is not morally acceptable.  "Some of these schemes we have seen are quite frankly morally wrong. People work hard, they pay their taxes, they save up to go to one of his shows. They buy the tickets.  "He is taking the money from those tickets and he, as far as I can see, is putting all of that into some very dodgy tax avoiding schemes."  June 2013: Announcing that the US, UK and other G8 members had agreed to a series of tax transparency agreements following a summit in Northern Ireland, Mr Cameron said:  "Let me commend Britain's NGOs and charities for the campaigning work they have done for years on campaigning against tax secrecy, campaigning for openness, campaigning for transparency in extractive industries.  "This is a cause I have long espoused and have long believed in.  "The declaration says that tax authorities across the world automatically share information, that companies should know who owns them, tax collectors and law enforcers should be able to get this information easily.  "These are really strong commitments that have never been written down in this sort of way and then signed. This is words on a page that the G8 is going to be judged on year after year after year."  June 2013: Announcing that the UK had reached an agreement with the UK's Overseas Territories and Crown dependencies to sign up to a tax evasion clampdown, Mr Cameron said:  "It is important we are getting our house in order. It is a very positive step forward and it means that Britain's voice in the G8, and campaigning on this issue around the world for proper taxes, proper companies, proper laws... will be stronger."  June 2013: Speaking at an event highlighting the damage that tax evasion does to global trade and developing countries, Mr Cameron said:  "The extraordinary thing about this tax, transparency and trade agenda is that it's not just the right thing for us to do morally it's right for our economies too.  "Because when some businesses don't pay their taxes, it corrodes public trust. When some companies don't play by the rules, that drives more regulation and makes it harder for other businesses to turn a profit...  "It means getting companies to report to tax authorities where they earn their profits and where they pay their tax. It also means transparency about who owns which companies and who benefits from it - so called beneficial ownership.  "Why? Because some people use complicated and fake structures to hide their profits and avoid taxes."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-36013713	Philippines elections hack 'leaks voter data'	The Philippines may have suffered its worst-ever government data breach barely a month before its elections.  Personal information, including fingerprint data and passport information, belonging to around 70 million people is said to have been compromised by hackers.  The Philippine Commission on the Elections (Comelec) saw its website defaced at the end of March.  The Anonymous Philippines group has claimed responsibility for the attack.  The group said it sought to highlight "vulnerabilities" in the system, including the use of automated voting machines that will be used on 9 May.  A second hacker group called LulzSec Philippines is believed to have posted Comelec's entire database online several days later.  Comelec claims that no sensitive information was released, according to multiple reports.  However, cybersecurity firm Trend Micro believes the incident is the biggest government-related data breach in history and that authorities are downplaying the problem.  "Every registered voter in the Philippines is now susceptible to fraud and other risks," it said in a report.  The Philippines general election takes place every six years and will see a new president, vice-president and more than 18,000 other officials voted into office.  Investors will closely be watching the polls given the Philippines is one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.  This is only the third time the South East Asian nation has held automated elections and Comelec has faced criticism that security is not tight enough.  Ryan Flores, a senior manager at Trend Micro, said the government's cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to the election being "sabotaged".  "One of the more sensitive issues is that the [leaked] database is the same for the automated system being used for the election," he told the BBC.  "Come election period, anyone who has ill intentions can modify the results."  That was one of the reasons Anonymous Philippines cited for hacking the Comelec website.  It posted a message saying "what happens when the electoral process is so mired with questions and controversies? Can the government still guarantee that the sovereignty of the people is upheld?"  Trend Micro believes the Philippines breach may surpass the 2015 hack of the US Office of Personnel Management.  That incident saw the data on 20 million US citizens, including fingerprints and social security numbers, stolen by unknown hackers. Data taken in that attack has, so far, not been found online.  Last week, Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca saw more than 11 million documents released in what is being described as the biggest data leak in history.  Other high-profile targets in recent years where data has been stolen include online dating site Ashley Madison, US retailer Target and the entertainment arm of Sony.  The healthcare and education industries are the most affected by data breaches, according to Trend Micro.  Government agencies are the third biggest sector, followed by retail and financial industries.  Mr Flores believes such breaches are likely to happen again, particularly in developing countries, and that "a stronger security mindset" was needed.  This includes the hiring of an information security team who would be responsible for highly sensitive data, as well as installing software that can track any irregularities in the network.  Mr Flores said countries like the Philippines "don't really have any agency or mandate in the government to improve their security posture".  "They have more pressing needs rather than digital security," he said. "Being a third world country plays into that."  However, he stressed that the investment was needed given there was an increasing trend of young people with technology know-how gravitating towards hacking groups.	tech

In a first for a UK prime minister, Mr Cameron has released a summary of his tax returns from 2009-15 as he tries to defuse a row over his finances.  The two £100,000 payments were made a year after the PM inherited £300,000 from his father in 2010, papers show.  Ministers said he'd done nothing wrong but Labour said questions remained.  Meanwhile, Mr Cameron is to make a statement to MPs on Monday on government measures to tackle tax evasion.  In the past six years, Mr Cameron earned a total of almost £1.1m and paid about £400,000 in income tax, according to the three-page summary.  Last year, he paid almost £76,000 in tax on an income of more than £200,000. Those earnings included almost £47,000 from a share of rent paid on his family home in west London.  Downing Street is providing no details about the £72,000 the PM received for selling "other shares" beyond his investment in his Blairmore Holdings fund or the £40,000 he received in cash from his stockbroking account.  The payments by Mary Cameron to her son in May and July 2011 were given tax free, and will only become liable to inheritance tax of up to 40% if she dies within seven years of handing over the money.  Downing Street said the payments were an attempt to "balance" the sums received by all the Cameron children, as Mr Cameron's older brother had inherited the family home.  Mr Corbyn said Mr Cameron needed to publish his full tax returns dating back to before he became prime minister in 2010, when he sold off shares in his late father's offshore investment fund for a £19,000 profit.  "I want to see the papers," Mr Corbyn told the Andrew Marr show.  "We need to know what he's actually returned as a tax return. We need to know why he put this money overseas in the first place, and whether he made anything out of it or not before 2010 when he became prime minister. These are questions that he must answer."  Asked about the £200,000 gift Mr Cameron received from his mother, the Labour leader said there was "possibly" a case for looking at inheritance tax rules.  He said: "It does actually reduce the level of inheritance tax that is available for the Exchequer as a whole."  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister had "effectively inherited £500,000 from his mum and dad and not paid a penny on it," which, he said, showed there was "something wrong with the system".  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has, meanwhile, published her tax return for 2014/15, and committed to publishing it annually for as long as she is First Minister. It shows she earned £104,817, and paid more than £31,000 in tax.  Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale was the first Scottish party leader to publish her tax returns, on Saturday, and was swiftly followed Ms Sturgeon, the Conservatives's Ruth Davidson and Lib Dem Willie Rennie.  Inheritance tax is paid if a person's estate (their property, money and possessions) is worth more than £325,000 when they die. The rate is 40% on anything above the threshold.  Married couples and civil partners are allowed to pass their possessions and assets to each other tax-free.  The deceased's estate may not have to pay inheritance tax on assets the deceased gave away as gifts while they were alive. The original owner must live for seven years after giving the gift.  One person's tax planning is another person's tax avoidance - so whether David Cameron's tax affairs are controversial or not is really a matter of where you stand on the payment of tax.  Most tax accountants would advise a wealthy family on "gifts" - payments of money - to their children and how to ensure they are not liable for inheritance tax by making payments in tranches to avoid breaching tax thresholds.  Mr Cameron's family appear to have done this, and Downing Street says the payments were made by the prime minister's mother to "even out" the inheritance payments made to her children following her husband's death. Not to avoid tax.  Mr Corbyn, who has promised to publish his own tax returns "very soon", also suggested Britain needed to be "much more assertive" on the question of overseas arrangements in the UK's overseas territories and asked why Britain was "encouraging" tax havens.  And he said greater openness around tax affairs might be expected from all those in public life, not just MPs, in future, saying: "I think we're moving in that direction".  The SNP are, meanwhile, calling on Mr Cameron to publish a financial statement on all government ministers, including Chancellor George Osborne, revealing whether they have benefited from offshore tax havens.  A Treasury source said: "We have been clear that the chancellor has never had any offshore shareholdings or other interests.  "His income and interests are straightforward and declared publicly: his salary, rental income from a property in London and a shareholding in his father's firm, Osborne and Little.  "He is always happy to consider ways to offer even more transparency."  Energy and climate change secretary Amber Rudd defended the prime minister on the Andrew Marr show, saying Mr Cameron had "said all there is to be said" about his tax affairs, having taken the "unprecedented step" of publishing details.  She said Mr Cameron and his family had done nothing wrong and had paid the correct amount of tax due, adding that going after tax havens had been a "key priority" for the government since 2010.  Mr Cameron has also announced a new task force to investigate tax-dodging allegations arising from the leak of 11 million documents from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, known as the Panama Papers.  The prime minister was dragged into the controversy when it emerged his late father's investment fund, Blairmore, was a client of the firm.  Downing Street issued a series of statements over four days as pressure on Mr Cameron mounted before he finally admitted he had benefited from the fund.  On Saturday, he admitted he could have better handled the row over his financial affairs, telling people to "blame me" for the slow response, not Downing Street officials.  He said he was publishing the information on his income to be "completely open and transparent".  The prime minister's salary was steady at £142,500 from 2010 to 2015, but there were tax variations due to treatment of his pension contributions and the different approaches to his £20,000 tax-free allowance.  In terms of rent earned on the Notting Hill house, Mr Cameron's 50% share, minus expenses, was £45,041 in 2011-12, £46,700 in 2012-13, £47,764 in 2013-14 and £46,899 last year.  The new tax task force announced by Mr Cameron will have initial funding of £10m and involve staff from the Serious Fraud Office and Financial Conduct Authority as well as HMRC and the NCA.  The government said the agencies had leading technology, experts and resources to tackle money laundering and tax evasion.  Mr McDonnell said proposals for the task force to report to the chancellor and home secretary were "unacceptable".  "Any inquiry must be fully independent and in public," he said.	politics

They include forcing transparency standards on UK overseas territories and a register of offshore trusts.  The party has called for a public inquiry into alleged abuses uncovered in leaked documents from a Panama law firm - and vowed not to accept donations linked to tax avoidance.  The government has set up a task force to look into the Panama Papers.  And the prime minister has taken the unprecedented step of publishing details of his tax and income over the past six years following Labour claims he had misled the public over whether he had benefitted from an offshore fund.  David Cameron will also host an international anti-corruption summit in London next month - and the government is to publish a register of beneficial ownership, revealing who ultimately gains from shadowy shell companies used to avoid tax.  But Labour argue Mr Cameron should publish his full tax returns and say the government's £10m task force must be "fully independent and in public".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "After a week of half-truths and spin from this government in the wake of the revelations in the Panama Papers leak, it's time to clean out the tax havens with real government action.  "It should be a matter of shame to the British government that more than half the companies recently named in the Panama Papers were registered in UK-governed tax havens.  "Not only has this government impeded international efforts to crack down on tax avoidance and to tackle tax havens but senior figures are personally implicated in these immoral schemes."  Labour also questioned a letter Mr Cameron wrote to EU officials in 2013, which called for offshore trusts to be excluded from a crackdown on tax avoidance.  The government said Mr Cameron had felt forcing trusts to reveal who gained financially from them would "distract" from action in more pressing areas.  But Mr McDonnell said: "It is deeply concerning that our prime minister has still failed to clarify whether or not he or his family were benefiting directly or indirectly in 2013 when he was lobbying to prevent EU measures to better regulate trusts as a way to clamp down on tax avoidance."  The shadow chancellor also promised that Labour would reject any donations linked to tax avoidance.  Political donations made by individuals are not tax-deductible in the UK - but money left in wills to major parties is not subject to inheritance tax.  Labour accepted a £1.65m donation in shares in 2013, from home shopping magnate John Mills, which he said at the time was a more "tax efficient" way of donating to the party than giving cash.  Quizzed about the Mills donation on BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics, Mr McDonnell said: "Every penny that comes in to us will open and transparent.  "We will not be touching money that is used by any way in measures to avoid tax or evade tax, we will not allow that to happen and we're not allowing that to happen."  Mr McDonnell and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn have also suggested that the inheritance tax system is in need of reform to make it "fairer".  Mr McDonnell told Pienaar's Politics: "I don't personalise politics, this is about the system, and a system whereby someone can inherit, effectively, £500,000 from his mum and dad and not pay a penny on it, I think there's something wrong in the system that allows that to happen."  But Housing minister Brandon Lewis pointed out that the gift from Mrs Cameron to her son was no different from similar arrangements used in other families, it was just a "larger sum of money".  Jeremy Corbyn has previously suggested the current 40% inheritance tax rate, which kicks in at £135,000, should be "graded" so the wealthiest families pay more.	politics

Addressing the Tories' spring forum, he said he was to blame for the handling of revelations about his holding in his late father's offshore fund.  Days after questions were first raised, the PM admitted this week he had owned and later sold units in the fund.  Mr Cameron also said he would publish information on his tax returns later.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he "looked forward" to that publication.  BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said the decision to publish the tax returns would keep the prime minister's finances in the headlines.  But Downing Street felt the only way to move forward was by confronting the issue head on with an unprecedented level of detail, our correspondent said, adding however that Labour was in no mood to let the row drop.  Hundreds of protesters calling on Mr Cameron to "close tax loopholes or resign" rallied outside Downing Street on Saturday, some moving on to demonstrate outside the venue where the Conservative forum was held.  Addressing Conservative Party activists at the central London forum, Mr Cameron said: "It has not been a great week. I know that I should have handled this better, I could have handled this better.  "I know there are lessons to learn and I will learn them.  Mr Cameron said: "I was obviously very angry about what people were saying about my dad. I loved my dad, I miss him every day.  "He was a wonderful father and I'm very proud of everything he did. But I mustn't let that cloud the picture. The facts are these: I bought shares in a unit trust, shares that are like any other sorts of shares and I paid taxes on them in exactly the same way.  "I sold those shares. In fact, I sold all the shares that I owned, on becoming prime minister."  Mr Cameron continued: "Later on I will be publishing the information that goes into my tax return, not just for this year but the years gone past because I want to be completely open and transparent about these things.  "I will be the first prime minister, the first leader of a major political party, to do that and I think it is the right thing to do."  Revelations about Mr Cameron's financial affairs followed a leak of 11 million documents this month held by Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca.  The documents, known collectively as the Panama Papers, revealed that Mr Cameron's late father Ian had been a client of Mossack Fonseca when establishing a fund for investors.  Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for an "open and public" inquiry into the revelations.  This mea culpa by the prime minister is solely on how the questions about his tax affairs have been handled, not on his decision to hold shares in his late father's offshore firm.  David Cameron remains adamant that he did not break any rules and that his father's Bahamas-based business had not been established for the purpose of avoiding tax.  But he is well aware that taking several days to confirm that he used to hold shares has allowed his political opponents to accuse him of "misleading" the public.  And so in an attempt to show he has nothing to hide, he will publish "information" from his tax returns.  That may or may not take some heat out of the row, depending on what the "information" actually is. But politically, a lot of damage has already been done.  When David Cameron refers to taking personal responsibility, he is seeking to shield his closest advisers in Downing Street, who some sections of the press - and even one or two Conservatives - have been criticising for the prime minister's flawed response.  Protesters at a demonstration in central London waved placards and chanted slogans criticising tax avoidance.  Downing Street protest organiser, journalist Abi Wilkinson, told BBC Radio 5 live the week's revelations raised questions about Mr Cameron's commitment to tackling tax avoidance.  "But the thing that really made us think we had to get out and protest was the news that, in 2013 when the EU were trying to crack down on offshoring and tax avoidance, he stepped in and actually weakened what they were trying to do," she said.  Meanwhile, Labour leader Mr Corbyn said the issue was, "not about an individual, not about one person, one family, it's about a whole ethos where the very rich are able to put their money into tax havens, offshore accounts".  "That is money that is being made that is untaxed and doesn't contribute anything to the need of public services."  Mr Corbyn said he would publish his own tax returns "very, very soon, when I've got the papers together".  Commons leader Chris Grayling said those accusing Mr Cameron of misleading the public were making a "mountain out of a mole hill".  At the Conservative spring forum, Mr Cameron said local elections in England and mayoral contests in London, Bristol, Liverpool and Salford on 5 May gave voters a clear choice between "Tory competence and the disarray of the rest".  Only Tory councils could be trusted to keep taxes low while "getting things done" and "delivering more for less", he said.  The Conservatives are defending about 880 seats last contested in 2012.  More than 2,700 seats in 124 councils across England are up for grabs next month in what will be Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's first national test in England at the ballot box.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35999696	Cameron: Conservative councils 'doing more for less'	Only Conservative councils can be trusted to keep taxes low and give more power to local residents, David Cameron has said, as he launched the party's English local elections campaign.  The vote on 5 May is a clear choice between "Tory competence and the disarray of the rest", he said.  The prime minister argued council tax had fallen in real terms since 2010 as town halls gained budgetary freedoms.  The Conservatives are defending about 880 seats last contested in 2012.  More than 2,700 seats in 124 councils across England are up for grabs next month in what will be Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's first national test in England at the ballot box.  Labour did well the last time the majority of the seats were contested in 2012, while the Conservatives - who are the largest party in local government but are fighting their first set of council elections as a majority government for 20 years - lost about 300 seats.  The government has been accused of giving local authorities no option but to cut services such as as libraries, children's centres and bus routes by slashing the value of the Whitehall grant to councils over the past five years.  Mr Cameron has clashed with the Conservative leader of Oxfordshire County Council, which covers his Witney constituency, over whether councils are doing enough to cut their operating costs and make efficiency savings as a way of protecting core services.  Speaking at the Conservatives' Spring Forum, Mr Cameron urged voters to focus on Tory councils' record of "getting things done" while "delivering more for less".  "These local elections provide a clear choice - the competence of a strong Conservative council who will keep taxes down with quality local services, against the disarray of the rest," he said.  The Conservatives say council tax has risen by an average of 6% since 2010 - lower than the rate of inflation - because of the funding it has given to councils to cover a freeze in rates.  Mr Cameron argued the decision to allow councils to retain 100% of their business rates by 2020 was evidence of a bold, reforming government that was willing to trust local communities and give them a direct stake in economic growth.  He also defended a series of controversial policies - such as giving all social housing tenants the right to buy their own home, turning all schools into academies by 2022 and making the NHS a "truly" seven-day service - as evidence of a government doing "big things".  "A Conservative government could be proud of achieving any one of those things in one term. We are doing them all."  In her speech, Home Secretary Theresa May said councils had new powers and voting on 5 May would decide how billions of pounds would be raised and spent.  "A vote for a Conservative is a vote for a local authority that respects the council tax payer and works hard for them," she said.  "Conservative councils have innovated to turn back the tide on the years when Labour let council tax double and services stagnate."  Labour has suggested its councils are being targeted in the latest round of spending cuts, which will see average funding fall by 6.7% by 2020. This comes on top of a nearly 30% reduction in Whitehall grants between 2010 and 2015.  They also argue councils in poorer areas could also lose out from the business rate changes.  Also in England on 5 May there are elections for a new mayor in London as well as Bristol, Liverpool and Salford. The elections are taking place seven weeks before June's referendum on the UK's future membership of the EU.	politics

A letter filed to a local court said the government "continues to require Apple's assistance".  In Boston, unsealed court papers show a judge ordered Apple to assist authorities in another criminal case.  The judge ruled it was "reasonable" to ask Apple to extract data from the device.  US Magistrate Judge Marianne Bowler made the Boston order in February, but it was only unsealed on Friday.  In a separate case last month, the FBI dropped a court order demanding Apple help investigators unlock the iPhone of San Bernardino killer Syed Farook.  The FBI had said it was able to gain access to the device independently. This method is said only work on certain older models of the iPhone.  The device in the Boston case - owned by alleged gang member Desmond Crawford - is a later-model iPhone.  In February, a judge ruled that Apple could not be forced to give access to the phone in the New York case.  The judge denied a motion by the Justice Department - a decision which was followed by a government appeal.  Jun Feng, who owned the iPhone, pleaded guilty to taking part in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy last year.  Authorities have said they still wish to unlock the device, however, as part of an ongoing investigation into the conspiracy.  Here we go again - but with a twist.  In San Bernardino, the FBI wanted Apple to create new software to allow them to bypass security measures on Syed Farook's iPhone. Apple's defence - one that looked solid, though never tested - was that it was not right to be forced by the courts to create something new, and that it would infringe on the firm's right to free speech.  So in New York, in a case involving an individual who has pleaded guilty to a drugs-related charge, the FBI is instead asking Apple to just grab the data off the phone.  In this case, the iPhone is a 5S running iOS7. That's significant - the San Bernardino shooter had iOS8. iOS7, while still encrypting data on the device, is less secure.  That said, added security measures built into the hardware on the drug dealer's 5S - more up-to-date than Farook's 5C - could be the reason why the FBI's technique doesn't work here.  But Apple isn't really buying that.  In a conference call to reporters which it requested we didn't quote directly, Apple argued that the FBI complained all along it absolutely needed Apple's help in San Bernardino, until it, well, didn't.  So the company is questioning why the FBI can't access this iPhone itself, and reiterated its belief that investigators are simply trying to set a precedent in order to make accessing locked iPhones easier in the future.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook  Previously, Apple had said that it was "impossible" for the company to help in unlocking newer devices.  The iPhone in the New York case is an older model, but the firm has so far refused to aid investigators wishing to access its data.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35994283	Labour says PM 'losing trust' over offshore fund row	Labour has said David Cameron's admission that he owned shares in an offshore fund set up by his late father has undermined public trust in him.  On Thursday, the PM said he sold the shares before he entered Number 10 in 2010 and had paid all UK taxes due on profits from the £30,000 sale.  He said the firm, Blairmore Holdings, had not been set up to avoid tax.  But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the PM had "misled the public" and "lost the trust of the British people".  He said Mr Cameron's actions had showed there was "one rule for the wealthy and another for the rest of us".  "After years of calling for tax transparency and attacking complex offshore tax arrangements as 'morally wrong', the prime minister has been shown to have personally benefited from exactly such a secretive offshore investment," he said.  Mr Corbyn said the PM must give a "full account of all his private financial dealings and make a statement to Parliament next week".  He also accused the government of "connivance with tax havens and refusal to take serious action against tax avoidance and evasion", leading "directly" to public spending cuts.  Labour backbencher John Mann has called on the Commons Standards Commissioner to look into why Mr Cameron's stake in Blairmore was not disclosed in the register of MPs' financial interests.  Conservative MPs have defended Mr Cameron while Downing Street - whose handling of the issue has been criticised - has insisted the prime minister's financial interests have "always been recorded in line with the rules as they stood at the time".  There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings - a fund for investors which until 2006 used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy - following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.  Thousands of similar funds, or companies, have been set up for various reasons although, ultimately of course, their aim is to make money.  Those on one side of the argument will argue that these funds exist, and are based offshore, primarily owing to the opportunity to escape paying certain taxes.  The opposing argument is that this decision is purely based on rational business grounds, by finding a way to attract investors from around the world and for the fund to perform to its peak.  They show that Mr Cameron's father, Ian, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.  Downing Street and Mr Cameron had issued four statements on whether Mr Cameron had any financial involvement with Blairmore Holdings before the PM told ITV News on Thursday about the shares he had owned.  Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said Mr Cameron could not be blamed for his father's actions but had not been "entirely straight with the British people about what his own financial arrangements were".  "That wouldn't be so bad if he hadn't also been lecturing very prominent people about their own tax arrangements, some he called morally wrong for being invested in similar schemes," he said.  While stopping short of calling for the PM to quit, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was regrettable the information had had to be "dragged" out of him.  "You need to be able to trust your prime minister and the fact that he couldn't answer a straight question, straightforwardly, straight away I think has undermined the trust that we have in him," he said.  SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the prime minister had "big questions to answer" while Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said his behaviour illustrated a government that was intent on supporting a "small proportion of the establishment not acting in the national interest".  But James Quarmby, a specialist in tax planning and wealth structuring at law firm Stephenson Harwood, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was a "massive misunderstanding" about what Mr Cameron had invested in.  He said it was a hedge fund that was "about as boring as it gets for investments", adding that it would not be used for avoiding tax.  "It's no different from Mr Cameron investing in a UK stock," he said.  Even David Cameron himself has admitted it has been a pretty difficult week.  Downing Street has been thrown on the defensive, forced to ride out damning headlines that have dogged the prime minister day after day. There have been accusations Mr Cameron has "played the public" on his tax affairs and that he has lost the electorate's trust.  Remember, he is currently in the middle of the political fight of his life, battling to keep Britain in the European Union. He's trying to persuade voters to believe his arguments, trying to win over their trust in the referendum debate. So, the timing isn't good. Anything like this that highlights the distance between him and voters will not help.  The problem for the prime minister is political image. He hasn't done anything illegal but it is perception that matters.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the prime minister had "acted quite properly" and done everything that could be expected of him.  Speaking on Any Questions on BBC Radio 4, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Mr Cameron had done nothing "at all improper" and had "the fuller questions... been asked of him earlier in the week then it might all have been neater".  Conservative Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee, said Number 10 had clearly "mishandled" the issue.  "I don't know who's been advising... but it clearly would have been much better if a much cleaner breast of all the facts had been made right at the outset," he told Radio 4's World at One.  Business Minister Nick Boles said "with the benefit of hindsight" it might have been better if the PM had revealed details of his shareholdings when the allegations first surfaced on Monday but he understood Mr Cameron's "natural human instinct to rally round his father".  In his interview on Thursday, Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."  Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore was set up to avoid tax.  "It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.  Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500. That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.  The rules on members' interests state MPs must declare a company shareholding if it exceeds 15% of total shares issued or is worth more than £70,000. Holdings in collective investment vehicles such as unit trusts and investment companies with variable capital do not need to be registered.	politics

Labour MPs are keeping up the pressure with demands for Mr Cameron to come to the House of Commons next week and give a statement explaining his tax affairs.  If the PM was hoping this would all have blown over by the weekend, he's likely to be mistaken; the questions will continue to come. And with the PM's promise to publish his tax return in the coming days there'll be another opportunity for his critics to pile the pressure on again.  I think Downing Street has been left furious by events. During an unusually terse conversation with a No 10 source, I asked how they felt at the end of such a troubling week.  "Hindsight is a wonderful thing," they replied - an admission, I think, they'd do things very differently if they had the chance again.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35996408	The ransomware that knows where you live	A widely distributed scam email that quoted people's postal addresses links to a dangerous form of ransomware, according to a security researcher.  Andrew Brandt, of US firm Blue Coat, contacted the BBC after hearing an episode of BBC Radio 4's You and Yours that discussed the phishing scam.  Mr Brandt discovered that the emails linked to ransomware called Maktub.  The malware encrypts victims' files and demands a ransom be paid before they can be unlocked.  The phishing emails told recipients they owed hundreds of pounds to UK businesses and that they could print an invoice by clicking on a link - but that leads to malware, as Mr Brandt explained.  One of the emails was received by You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl.  "It's incredibly fast and by the time the warning message had appeared on the screen it had already encrypted everything of value on the hard drive - it happens in seconds," Mr Brandt told the BBC.  "This is the desktop version of a smash and grab - they want a quick payoff."  Maktub doesn't just demand a ransom, it increases the fee - which is to be paid in bitcoins - as time elapses.  A website associated with the malware explains that during the first three days, the fee stands at 1.4 bitcoins, or approximately $580. This rises to 1.9 bitcoins, or $790, after the third day.  The phishing emails tell recipients that they owe money to British businesses and charities when they do not.  One of the organisations named was the Koestler Trust, a charity which helps ex-offenders and prisoners produce artwork.  "We rely on generous members of the public and we were very distressed when we discovered that people felt they had received emails from us asking for money, when indeed they had not been generated by us at all," chief executive Sally Taylor told You and Yours.  One remarkable feature of the scam emails was the fact that they included not just the victim's name, but also their postal address.  Many, including BBC staff, have noted that the addresses are generally highly accurate.  According to Dr Steven Murdoch, a cybersecurity expert at the University of London, it's still not clear how scammers were able to gather people's addresses and link them to names and emails.  The data could have come from a number of leaked or stolen databases for example, making it hard to track down the source.  Several people contacted the You and Yours team to say that they were concerned data might have been taken from their eBay accounts, as their postal addresses had been stored there in the same format as they appeared in the phishing emails.  In a statement, the firm said: "Ebay works aggressively to protect customer data and privacy, which is our highest priority.  "We are not aware of any link between this new phishing scam and eBay's data.  "We continually update our approach to customer data security in an effort to create the safest environment possible for our customers."  The UK's national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre has been flooded with queries from people targeted by the scam.  "We have been inundated with this," said deputy head Steve Proffitt.  "At Action Fraud on Monday we received an additional 600 calls and from then onwards we've received 500 calls to our contact centre a day," he added.  Mr Proffitt advised people who had received the phishing emails to under no circumstances click on the link, but instead delete the message from their system and inform Action Fraud.  Referring specifically to Maktub and the approach taken by the phishers, Dr Murdoch said he believed the scam was "significant" in more ways than one.  "It also appears to be quite widespread - I've heard about it from multiple sources so it seems like they were fairly successful getting a lot of these sent out," he told the BBC.  He added that it was hard to know how to advise people who were unfortunate enough to have their files encrypted by ransomware.  For some individuals without backups, paying the ransom might be the only way to retrieve their data.  "However, every person that does that makes the business more valuable for the criminal and the world worse for everyone," he said.	tech

The Furcast group says the 90-minute podcast went out without its knowledge and it is "deeply sorry".  Two Texas stations were among those which broadcast the material, aimed at "furries"- people interested in animals that are given human traits.  Broadcasters have been advised to change passwords on the hardware many of them use.  Barix streaming boxes are popular with broadcasters and PA professionals.  Furcast said that multiple server requests for its content during the incident were in the name of "Barix Streaming Client" and that many of the individual boxes involved were visible on Shodan, a search engine for devices connected via the Internet of Things.  The BBC has contacted Barix for comment but the problem appears to be with security settings not being updated by the box owners.  "Someone is attacking Barix Boxes," wrote a member of the Alabama Broadcast Association.  "Several radio stations and at least one radio network have been compromised. The Barix receiver is pointed to an obscene podcast and its password changed so it can only be reset manually."  Furries are people who have a fascination with anthropomorphism and often dress in animal costumes.  The furry group Furcast describes itself as "an improv comedy-themed furry podcast with no censor" and denies that its main aim is to create sexual material.  "Our content is discovered by individuals who specifically seek what we produce, and they do not normally come into contact with it via public means," they wrote.  "We have no interest in being discovered by a mainstream audience."  "At about 9am we were notified that a programme was playing on the station that did not originate from this studio," the station wrote on Facebook.  "We found out that our equipment had been hacked and was broadcasting a podcast or a stream from an unknown source.  "We were able to eventually get the problem resolved. But still want to apologise to anyone who may have heard the programming."  KXAX general manager Jason Mclelland told Ars Technica there did not appear to have been a reason for the hack.  Another station affected, KIFT, said in a statement that it had only been able to regain control of its output when an engineer physically went to the site of the hacked remote transmitter.  "We are working with equipment manufacturers and auditing the security of our own systems to avoid any repeats of this incident," it said.	tech

The PM has faced questions over Blairmore Holdings, an offshore company set up by his late father, Ian.  He told ITV News he had paid all UK taxes due on the profits he made from the sale of the shares and said the firm had not been set up to avoid tax.  Labour said the PM had been forced into the "extraordinary admission".  The BBC understands Mr Cameron will publish his tax returns, possibly next week.  There have been days of headlines about Blairmore Holdings, a fund for investors which, until 2006, used "bearer shares" to protect its clients' privacy, following the leak of 11 million documents held by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.  They show that Ian Cameron, who died in 2010, was one of five UK directors who flew to board meetings in the Bahamas or Switzerland.  On Wednesday, Downing Street issued a statement saying Mr Cameron, his wife and children did not benefit from offshore funds - following a day of questions from the media about whether his family retained an interest in the fund.  On Thursday Mr Cameron told ITV News: "I don't have anything to hide. I'm proud of my dad and what he did and the business he established... I can't bear to see his name being dragged through the mud."  The PM said it had been a "difficult few days, reading criticisms of my father and his business practices - my dad, a man I love and admire and miss every day".  Mr Cameron said much criticism was based on a "fundamental misconception" that Blairmore Investment was set up to avoid tax.  "It wasn't. It was set up after exchange controls went, so that people who wanted to invest in dollar denominated shares and companies could do so, and there are many other, thousands of other unit trusts set up in this way," he said.  Mr Cameron said the fund was "properly audited" and reported to the Inland Revenue every year. Anyone who bought units in it was subject to capital gains tax when shares were sold, he said.  He said that he had owned stocks and shares in the past but sold them in 2010 shortly before he became prime minister.  "I didn't want to anyone to say you've got other agendas or vested interests," he said.  "Samantha and I had a joint account and we owned 5,000 units in Blairmore investment trust which we sold in January 2010, that was worth something like £30,000.  "I paid income tax on the dividends, but there was a profit on it, but that was less than the capital gains tax allowance, so I didn't pay capital gains tax, but it was subject to all the UK taxes in all the normal ways."  Downing Street said Mr and Mrs Cameron bought their holding in April 1997 for £12,497 and sold it in January 2010 for £31,500. That year the personal allowance before capital gains tax was paid was £10,100 per person.  A leak of 11.5 million documents has lifted the lid on how the rich and powerful use tax havens to hide their wealth.  The files were leaked from one of the world's most secretive companies, a Panamanian law firm called Mossack Fonseca.  Among the files are details about:  Mossack Fonseca says it has operated beyond reproach for 40 years and never been accused or charged with criminal wrong-doing.  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said that while there was no suggestion of illegality, it would be "politically embarrassing" for Mr Cameron to be associated with a company which did not pay tax in the UK, at a time when he was trying to encourage overseas territories to be more transparent about tax and was trying to clamp down on tax havens.  Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson said it was an "extraordinary admission": "David Cameron, who described the use of complex tax avoidance schemes as "morally wrong", has been forced to admit that he held shares in a fund now linked to tax avoidance."  He said there would be further questions about what Mr Cameron knew about the fund: "The time has come for David Cameron to put the record straight rather than having details dragged from him in instalments."  He told BBC News: "It feels like the prime minister is governing from the shadows in this announcement today. That he's been withholding personal information that he feels personal shame about."  And SNP economy spokesman Stewart Hosie MP described it as "an astounding revelation by a prime minister who has questioned the morality of using such tax-avoiding schemes".  He added: "David Cameron says he doesn't have anything to hide, yet had it not been for the Panama Papers leak we would have been none the wiser - and even then it has taken him several days to clarify he benefited from his father's off-shore trust."	politics

It marks the first time its US-based developer Bethesda has won the prize. It did not win in any other category.  British indie titles Everybody's Gone to the Rapture and Her Story both won three awards.  John Carmack - the creator of Doom, Wolfenstein 3D, and Quake - was also honoured with a Bafta fellowship.  He now works at Facebook's Oculus virtual reality division. He told the BBC there was a "very good chance" VR titles would dominate 2017's awards.  "Award shows like this will tend to be kind of bellwethers about where things are going," he explained.  "[The games] won't dominate the market for some time yet, but they will be the exciting things that people are talking about."  Fallout 4 is an action-focused role-playing game set in Boston following a nuclear war. It contains hundreds of hours of storyline to explore.  Like last year's winner - Destiny - it had not won a prize in any of the other categories before taking the top award.  The recipient said he was not expecting the result, and recalled that the franchise started with a small development budget.  "I'm genuinely humbled to receive this on behalf of Todd Howard and Bethesda game studios," he said.  "You don't have to have the multi-million dollar budgets to make great games - I've seen a huge amount of evidence for that tonight"  Everybody's Gone to the Rapture had been tipped for the top prize after being nominated 10 times across nine categories.  It won three of them: game innovation, music and performer.  The game is set in a fictitious Shropshire village in the 1980s and involves the player trying to find out what happened to the inhabitants who have disappeared.  Its pace is slow and the studio behind it said it wanted the title to have a distinctive English character.  "It was really important to us that it wasn't a chisel-jawed American hero going around fighting zombies," The Chinese Room's co-founder Jessica Curry told the BBC.  "It's kind of like the Archers," she added, referring to the BBC Radio 4 soap opera.  Her Story also won three awards: best debut game; best mobile and handheld title; and game innovation.  The game - in which players must try to solve a murder by sifting through an archive of video clips showing a woman being questioned by the police - was developed by Sam Barlow.  The British 37-year-old said he had deliberately tried to do something "experimental" focusing on an actor's performance to see if the idea would appeal.  Another award-winner with distinctive gameplay was Sundown.  Its developer - Mild Beast Games - has created a top-down stealth title in which characters are invisible until they are revealed by a light source.  Guns in the game shoot bursts of light rather than bullets.  The title took the the ones to watch prize for the Los Angeles-based developer.  Smite won the AMD eSports Audience Award - a new category that is voted for by the public.  The battle arena title is unusual for presenting its action from a third-party perspective behind each of the 71 gods the players can choose from.  This and other competitive multiplayer titles have become a popular spectator sport.  On Wednesday, it was announced that a new eGames international gaming tournament would make its debut in Rio during this summer's Olympic Games.  The titles nominated for best game are:	tech

Board of Deputies president Jonathan Arkush attacked Mr Corbyn's "deeply disturbing" response to a tweet by his brother criticising a Jewish Labour MP.  He said Mr Corbyn could not be "inert" where abuse in the party was alleged.  Mr Corbyn said: "Anti-Semitism is vile and wrong as is any form of racism."  Labour is currently investigating allegations of anti-Semitism including in its Oxford University branch, and last month it suspended one of its members for posting anti-Semitic tweets.  After Labour MP Louise Ellman said more needed to be done and that cracking down on such behaviour was "not just about words", Mr Corbyn's brother Piers tweeted saying this was "rubbish".  He added: "All #Corbyns are committed #AntiNazi. #Zionists cant cope with anyone supporting rights for #Palestine".  According to The Sun, when asked about his brother's tweet, Mr Corbyn said: "My brother has his point of view, I have mine and we actually fundamentally agree - we are a family that were brought up fighting racism from the day we were born."  Mr Akrush said: "Jeremy Corbyn's defence of his brother's belittling of the problem of anti-Semitism is deeply disturbing.  "We cannot imagine that any other minority's concerns would be dismissed off-hand in this way."  He said there had recently been "a stream of clear-cut cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party", and that the Jewish community as well as Labour politicians were "crying out" for the leader to take action.  "It would be incomprehensible for Mr Corbyn to remain inert and refuse to take this form of racism in his party seriously," he added.  London mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan recently said Mr Corbyn needed to take a "tougher stance" on tackling anti-Semitism, which he said should be a "a badge of shame" in the Labour Party.  Speaking on a visit to Norwich, Mr Corbyn said: "If anyone reports any form of anti-Semitism within our party, it is investigated immediately and cracked down upon.  "That message is unequivocal - we are a multifaith, multicultural Britain - let's respect each other and move on from there."	politics

Local drivers will test cars on public roads in "everyday conditions", according to a company press release.  The move was announced at an event in Beijing on 7 April, though details of a start date were not provided.  One analyst said he thought China was at the forefront of the development of autonomous cars.  Volvo is owned by a Chinese firm, Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co.  According to a report from the Reuters news agency, Volvo is now determining in which city to conduct the trials.  "Autonomous driving can make a significant contribution to road safety," said Hakan Samuelsson, president and chief executive of Volvo.  "The sooner [autonomous] cars are on the roads, the sooner lives will start being saved."  "I think people probably don't realise quite how much China's putting into advanced technology in cars," Prof David Bailey of Aston Business School told the BBC.  "Google has had a far smaller number of cars in tests as far as I can work out, so it is significant."  Prof Bailey added that China was both the biggest producer of, and market for, cars in the world.  The country is certainly no stranger to self-driving car tests - in December a driverless car completed a test on public roads in Beijing.  It had been developed by Chinese tech giant Baidu.  Silicon Valley tech giant Google simultaneously announced that it would expand testing of its self-driving vehicles to Phoenix, Arizona.  This will make it the fourth city to host trials of Google's autonomous cars.  "The Phoenix area has distinct desert conditions, which will help us better understand how our sensors and cars handle extreme temperatures and dust in the air," Jennifer Haroon, head of business operations for the Google Self-Driving Car project, told Reuters.  Google recently suffered a hiccup with one of its self-driving cars in California, after it crashed into a bus.  No-one was injured during the incident on 14 February.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35987839	Video game Olympics announced for Rio	A new eGames international gaming tournament will make its debut in Rio during this summer's Olympic Games.  The event, launched as part of this week's London Games Festival, offers medals and national pride rather than cash prizes for the winners.  The competition, backed by the UK government, will be run by the new International eGames Committee (IEGC).  Britain, Canada, Brazil and the USA are the only confirmed entrants so far with more expected to follow.  In Olympic years, both summer and winter, the eGames will take place in the host cities - with future tournaments planned for Pyeongchang in 2018 and Tokyo in 2020.  During other years, national qualifiers will be held domestically to produce teams for the next competition.  Competing countries will send mixed-sex squads of professional video gamers, aged over 18, to play in tournaments that will be held in Olympic venues.  This summer's inaugural event will be a two-day pop-up tournament in Brazil "to showcase the eGames to the world of competitive gaming and attract further partners", according to the official eGames website.  Competitive gaming, known as eSports, is a big business and professional tournaments offer thousands of pounds in prize money.  Top players are thought to earn upwards of £1m a year.  There has been a mixed reaction to the news, with games journalist Pao Bago writing on Twitter: "When will new organisers learn that best teams respond to the best incentives?  "Last night's eSports Olympics announcement was great and all but giving shiny medals and zero money is suspect."  Chester King, chief marketing officer for non-profit organisation the IEGC, said: "In line with other globally established sporting events, the eGames will be a medal only competition, with no prize money, but the opportunity to take home gold for your country."  "Potential sponsors and players will be reassured that a major government is backing the event and that will help with getting the funding and exposure the event will need to succeed," analyst Edward Barton at Ovum told the BBC.  However, Mr Barton added that there could be problems for the eGames competing with "wall-to-wall Olympic coverage" since the tournaments would be held at the same time.  "The eGames promises to be an exciting venture that will give eSports competitors across the UK even more opportunities to showcase their talents on an international stage," said Ed Vaizey, Minister for Culture.  The IEGC has not yet announced which video games will be played at the event, but promised a diverse mix of competitions.  "There will be a mix of PC and console games, maybe mobile," said Mr King.  "Currently most competitions are single games like Call Of Duty or Fifa so we will try to emulate the magic of an Olympics by having legends/champions from various eSports all in the same location."  Players for eTeam Britain will be chosen in national qualifying rounds.  "There will be an eGames Association set up in each country which will organise the national qualifying, which will have open heats and finals," said Mr King.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35983222	Panama Papers: Cameron faces questions over trust letter	David Cameron is facing questions about his attempt to exclude offshore trusts from an EU crackdown on tax avoidance.  The PM wrote to EU officials in 2013 to say trusts should not automatically be subject to the same transparency rules as companies.  Labour said this showed he did not take tax avoidance seriously.  But the government said he had felt forcing trusts to reveal who gained financially from them would "distract" from action in more pressing areas.  Britain is set to introduce a register of beneficial ownership in an attempt to shed light on the shadowy world of offshore "shell companies" used to avoid paying tax. It will force companies to reveal who ultimately gains financially from them.  But critics have said trusts can also be used to hide wealth, with one Dutch MEP saying Britain's efforts to exclude them from transparency legislation had created a "huge loophole".  In a letter to former European Council president Herman Van Rompuy in November 2013, Mr Cameron expressed reservation about extending such regulations, designed to reduce secrecy and limit the scope for abuse, to trusts, both those registered offshore and in the UK.  The disclosure, first reported by the Financial Times, comes after days of media scrutiny of the prime minister's personal tax affairs and those of Mr Cameron's late father Ian, who it has emerged was a client of the Panamanian firm Mossack Fonseca.  Mr Cameron committed to "looking properly" at the arguments around trusts and related private legal arrangements, such as inheritance planning.  But he warned the focus must be on lifting the veil of secrecy around shell companies and supporting a single global standard for exchanging tax information - aims championed by Mr Cameron during the UK's presidency of the G8 in 2013.  He wrote: "As we clamp down on the misuse of companies, we must take care not to displace illicit activity elsewhere".  Trust fund: A trust fund is a fund comprised of cash, stocks, bonds, property or other financial products. They are usually meant to provide benefits to an individual, often a child or grandchild, or organisation such as a charity. The fund recipient usually must wait until a certain age or until a certain event takes place in order to get an annual income from the fund. A trustee, or trustees, manage the funds, and are unable to benefit from the trust themselves.  Shell company: A shell company is a non-trading company without any significant assets or active operations. It may have had operations in the past that have become dormant or been wound down. It may be kept dormant for future use in some other capacity. Such companies are legal, but become criminal when they are used for criminal purposes such as tax evasion or money laundering.  Trust management and private wealth banking is a major source of income for Britain's financial services industry.  Responding to reports of the PM's letter to the EU, Labour Treasury spokesman Richard Burgon said the Conservatives should take tax avoidance more seriously.  He added: "And one way they can do that is to stop trying to block or undermine measures which would help to tackle it."  At the time of the PM's letter to Mr Van Rompuy, fears were being raised that the EU's proposals - aimed at money-laundering - would create extra cost and bureaucracy for families' financial planning.  The government said it had been concerned that "including trusts would distract from action against those areas of most concern, such as shell companies, and, in practice, these further changes weren't achievable".  "In the subsequent negotiations, we were able to secure a sensible way forward which ensures that trusts which generate tax consequences have to report their ownership to HMRC," a spokesman said.  Asked whether a loophole remained Dutch MEP Judith Sargentini, who led the European Parliament's work on the draft law, told the BBC: "Oh most definitely. Not only in Britain but elsewhere in Europe where they use trusts."  The British government was, she said, at the "forefront" of the lobbying.  German Green MEP Sven Giegold said the British government had been vital in securing the EU-wide beneficial ownership register for companies.  But he said the exemption for trusts meant "wealthy corporations are able to use this loophole so that poor people have to make up for the missing tax payments".  Speaking to students at Exeter University, Mr Cameron said when he chaired the G8 group of countries he had made tax and transparency "the number one issue" saying Britain was "an absolute leader" on the subject.  "Since then, Britain is going to be the first country in the world to have a totally open public register of beneficial ownership, so you can see who owns what company, and we've got other countries to sign up to that process," he added.	politics

A website operated by GS Media had posted links to an Australian site that was hosting the Playboy images.  An advocate general has now sided with the case of GS Media, against a claim of copyright infringement filed by Playboy's publisher.  The pictures were from a photo shoot with Dutch TV personality Britt Dekker.  The argument between GS Media and Playboy publisher Sanoma Media Netherlands dates back to 2011, when a blog on the GS Media website GreenStijl first linked to the Britt Dekker photographs.  However, posting a hyperlink to photos published without authorisation does not in itself constitute copyright infringement, according to Advocate General Melchior Wathelet in an Opinion to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU).  Mr Wathelet's Opinion is not ultimately binding on the court, though a ruling is set to follow in the coming months.  "This is only an opinion and the question is whether it will be followed," a spokesman for Sanoma said.  "I think this is an important conclusion," said Prof Mireille van Eechoud at the Institute for Information Law at the University of Amsterdam.  "Although [GreenStijl] facilitate access they don't actually have an indispensable role in the communication chain."  Prof Eechoud told the BBC that the advocate general was able to make this point thanks to the fact that the Australian website had no role in GreenStijl's decision to post links to the hosted images.  "I have to say that the advocate general does a very elaborate analysis of all the case law on point that has come before and it's closely argued," said Prof Eechoud.  "I would expect [the court] to follow it but they've been known not to, so that's difficult to predict."  Should that happen, the decision would then go back to the Dutch Supreme Court for further consideration.  The status of hyperlinking, according to Prof Eechoud, has historically not been clearly defined across EU member states and this in part accounts for the CJEU's role in cases like this one.  In 2014, a similar case was brought before the CJEU in which Swedish journalists argued that a web company that posted links to online news articles had broken copyright rules.  The court ruled, however, that because the articles in question were online already, they were "freely available" and so posting links to them would not constitute infringement.	tech

There is a $150,000 (£106,000) pot for rewarding the finders of significant bugs.  Unauthorised hacks make headlines and can have catastrophic consequences for the organisation that suffers a breach, so many seek to crowdsource their security in addition to employing their own in-house experts, offering financial rewards - known as bounties - as an incentive.  Last month Uber announced that it too was entering the bug bounty arena with a scheme of its own, while firms like Facebook and Microsoft have been running them for years.  Microsoft's top reward is currently up to $100,000 (£70,699) for "truly novel exploitation techniques against protections built into the latest version of our operating system" - or anything that bypasses all the security systems on the Windows platform.  Generally a bug bounty programme will pay a reward based on how significant the find is.  Facebook has so far paid out nearly $1m in bounties but the average pay-out in 2015 was $1,782 per bug - and its most prolific bug hunters were in India, Egypt, and Trinidad and Tobago, the social network says.  "By having bug bounty programmes, companies make sure the best hackers look at their code," says computer scientist Gianluca Stringhini, assistant professor at University College London.  "The more eyes look at the programme, the more bugs they find.  It's also a way for these companies to identify talent."  There's no doubt that if you're a successful part-time bug hunter you might even get a job out of it - security researcher Chris Vickery got his current role after doing just that.  "When I found one of the databases of [software firm] MacKeeper, they turned around and said 'OK, we want to hire you to give us tips about data breaches'," he said.  "That was an awesome response."  So how do you go about it?  Belgian bug hunter Arne Swinnen is currently ranked number two in Facebook's so-called white hat hall of fame - a surprisingly long list of the people who have helped it make its various platforms more secure by finding and telling it about vunerabilities before the cybercriminals exploit them.  Mr Swinnen has a day job but in his spare time has netted around $15,000 (£10,604) finding system weaknesses in the last few months.  "Some bugs that I've found they took me a couple of days, others only take five minutes. My biggest bug so far got me $2,500 (£1,767) and only cost me five minutes of my time."  He started out by looking at Facebook-owned Instagram after researching bugs online and identifying that fewer bug bounty hunters appeared to have it in mind.  "I looked to see what it had - website, mobile apps - I looked at their functionalities, and then started to look for vulnerabilities," he explains.  Mr Swinnen admits it isn't exactly his girlfriend's idea of a holiday - but it can be lucrative.  "It's my hobby, I like hunting, if you find something it's really a thrill," he told the BBC.  Of course many companies without designated schemes will generally be appreciative of some security support. There are a few issues to be aware of though if you plan to fish in the wild, as it were - not least that unauthorised access of a system is illegal in many countries.  "In the UK, under the Computer Misuse Act, unauthorised access is a criminal offence - even if the door is wide open," says cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University.  "You have to understand the law and how far you can push it. You also need to understand how the industry works because there are what you might think of as best practice [guidelines] - it's what responsible disclosure is all about."  Prof Woodward also warns about the responsibilities associated with handling any data you might find floating around, that perhaps isn't as encrypted or secure as it should be.  "You have a duty of care to whoever that data belongs to or is about," he adds.  "Some hackers perhaps feel they are above that but they are not.  "You have to be careful, it is a minefield - there is a fine line between probing for vulnerabilities and unauthorised access."  It is also a minefield for companies, especially small businesses who may well lack both the expertise and the resources to manage this global army of white hats - and the hackers hot on their heels.  "In general the problem is that when someone designs a programme they expect the user to play nicely.  "But an attacker could present an input that nobody thought about and that could make the programme play completely differently," says Gianluca Stringhini.  His basic advice to all firms is simple.  "Keep up with the news, see what new attacks are out there, make sure that whenever a new vulnerability is disclosed they update their systems - and keep an eye for general weird activity," he says.  Members of staff should also take note, he adds.  "You have systems you might develop but they might have holes - system administrators need to keep that in mind but so do end users, their data may not be safe."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35977340	Panama Papers: PM 'won't gain from offshore funds in future'	Downing Street has been forced to further clarify David Cameron's financial affairs after questions about his family's tax arrangements.  No 10 said there were "no offshore trusts or funds" that the prime minister or his immediate family would benefit from "in future".  Labour say questions still remain and want him to publish his tax returns.  It comes after a row over an investment fund set up by Mr Cameron's late father Ian.  Leaked documents revealed Ian Cameron was a client of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca and used one of the most secretive - albeit lawful - tools of the offshore trade after he helped set up a fund for investors.  But after a day of questions from the media about whether his family retains an interest in the fund, Downing Street took the unusual step of issuing a statement saying Mr Cameron, his wife and his children "do not benefit from any offshore trusts".  And Mr Cameron himself said he had no shares or income from offshore trusts.  It followed a call from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn for an independent inquiry into Britons linked to tax haven allegations - including Mr Cameron's family.  But there was criticism that Mr Cameron had not said whether he had already benefitted, or would gain in the future, from offshore funds.  In its latest statement, issued on Wednesday, Downing Street told the BBC: "There are no offshore trusts or funds from which the prime minister, Mrs Cameron or their children will benefit in future."  The statement did not address the issue of whether Mr Cameron had previously gained from his late father's investment fund - which Labour's Wes Streeting said needed clarifying.  "I think there are still questions about whether or not he benefited in the past," the MP, who sits on the Commons Treasury Select Committee, told BBC Radio 4 Today.  Labour MP Jess Phillips attacked David Cameron's late father for not "paying his fair share" of tax - saying it was "utterly disgusting," in a blog for the Huffington Post.  She said Mr Cameron "doesn't need our praise for paying his tax", adding: "He's not a very clever boy, he's a very average boy who used privilege rather than brains to get where he got."  Number Ten are clearly desperate to close down the ongoing story about the prime minister's tax affairs.  Hence, four statements in 24 hours.  But every time they close down one line of questioning - it simply opens up another one. Number Ten cling to the hope that the storm will blow over. But are they whistling in the wind?  Well, perhaps not.  Journalists may keep asking ever more intricate and detailed questions but will people still be interested?  Secondly, tax havens, offshore funds, bearer shares... it's all very complicated and perhaps a bit of a turn-off.  And finally it's a bit of a "Bullingdon" row.  Everyone knows Mr Cameron comes from a wealthy and privileged background.  Those that think this disqualifies him from being prime minister will probably continue to do so. Those that think it doesn't matter, will also probably continue to do so.  But London Mayor Boris Johnson, whose relationship with Mr Cameron has been strained by the EU referendum, defended the prime minister, dismissing the allegations about his financial affairs as "absolute tripe".  "The prime minister has made a very clear statement that he does not have a trust or any income from trusts and all the rest of it," he told LBC Radio.  Mr Corbyn said he would publish his tax returns and called on the prime minister to do the same.  Chancellor George Osborne said the government had done more than any previous government to tackle tax evasion and avoidance and to "make sure people pay the taxes that are owed".  Asked whether he himself had benefitted from an offshore fund, Mr Osborne said: "All of our interests as ministers and MPs are declared in the register of members' interests. We've made our position very clear."  A source close to the chancellor later said Mr Osborne "has no offshore interests, in shares or anything else" and had "made clear" his interests were "properly declared" in the register.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid, who is in India for talks with Tata Steel, was asked about his own financial affairs, and told the BBC: "I don't have any overseas trusts or overseas funds."  The prime minister is hosting an international anti-corruption summit in London in May as part of the government's transparency agenda.  Mr Cameron has said the government has reclaimed billions of pounds and led the world in having an open register of beneficial owners of companies, which is due to come into force in June.  He is facing calls to increase the pressure on tax haven UK overseas territories to fully open up their business registers to UK law enforcement agencies to improve transparency.  Labour has also called on the prime minister to consider taking "direct rule" of UK overseas dependencies and territories that do not comply with UK tax laws.	politics

The suspect, Jerome Antoine Dennis, was approached in the town of Clearwater on Sunday evening by an officer who noticed the smell of marijuana.  Police said the man tried to escape by hoverboard, but was arrested. He has yet to enter a plea to two charges.  Hoverboards are wheeled devices with a top speed of just over 10mph (16km/h).  "When a visibly marked officer attempted to make contact with the defendant he attempted to flee on his hoverboard and then on foot before being apprehended," the affidavit reads.  "A strong odour of marijuana was on the person as well."  Mr Dennis was charged with possession of marijuana and resisting an officer.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35976339	EU referendum: Row over impact of exit on farming and food prices	The government's farming minister has claimed leaving the European Union would allow Britain to "take control" and cut red tape for food producers.  George Eustice, who is backing the Vote Leave campaign, said some farmers would welcome the end of subsidies and prefer different kinds of help.  It follows a National Farmers Union report that warned exit could push up food prices and hit farm incomes.  Farming is set to be a key battleground in the run-up to 23 June's referendum.  Much will depend on what the government would do about subsidies currently paid through the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which is worth about £2.4bn a year to British farmers.  Supporters of the UK leaving the EU, such as Mr Eustice, argue that the British government would continue to provide direct support for its farmers.  The NFU report sets out three scenarios for what could happen to British farms if it left the EU - in two of them food prices increase, boosting farming incomes but reducing consumption of products as they become more expensive.  In the third, farm gate prices fall, benefiting consumers through lower prices but hitting farmers' incomes in many sectors.  The first two scenarios are based on the UK striking a trade agreement with the EU or through the World Trade organisation.  The third, based on a more liberalised trade policy, has significant negative impacts on farm-gate prices, particularly meat and some dairy, according to the report by Dutch university Wageningen said.  NFU director general Martin Haworth said: "Some of the scenarios appear to suggest that there could be serious risks to farm income from leaving the EU, while the results of others suggest there could be a more favourable outcome.  "It comes down to a matter of judgment as to which of the scenarios appears the most likely. This in turn will depend on the policy position adopted by the UK government."  Former NFU president Sir Peter Kendall warned the report highlighted the most likely outcome for British agriculture, which he said made for "depressing reading, with many farms facing a severe loss of income".  Labour's shadow farming minister Nick Smith said: "Our farmers deserve every opportunity to thrive and I believe they have the strongest and safest chance to do so by staying in."  But Mr Eustice, a former strawberry farmer who stood for UKIP before joining the Conservatives, said British farms would would still be supported "to the same level, possibly even more than now" if Britain left the EU.  He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be possible to "get rid of the very complex bureaucratic system of cross compliance regulations that we have now, lots of pointless administration would go, we would reduce the regulatory burdens on farmers".  On subsidies, he added: "We would still support farming to the same level, possibly even more than now, some of those countries that are outside the EU support their farmers to a greater extent financially, but we might support farming differently."  Mr Eustice argued farmers he had met did not like just being given a subsidy every year, adding if support could be given to help them earn their profit from the market "they would be happier with that".  He added that food prices were governed by changes in energy prices, by weather, global changes in supply and demand, plus exchange rates. These were global phenomena, he said, adding "they won't be affected by whether or not we are in or out of the EU".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35977227	Phishing email that knows your address	A new type of phishing email that includes the recipient's home address has been received by thousands of people, the BBC has learned.  Members of the BBC Radio 4's You and Yours team were among those who received the scam emails, claiming they owed hundreds of pounds to UK firms.  The firms involved have been inundated with phone calls from worried members of the public.  One security expert warned clicking on the link would install malware.  You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl was one of the first on the team to receive an email.  "The email has good spelling and grammar and my exact home address...when I say exact I mean, not the way my address is written by those autofill sections on web pages, but the way I write my address.  "My tummy did a bit of a somersault when I read that, because I wondered who on earth I could owe £800 to and what was about to land on my doormat."  She quickly realised it was a scam and did not click on the link.  "Then, a couple of minutes later, You and Yours producer Jon Douglas piped up as he'd received one and then another colleague said he'd received one too, but to his home email address," she added.  The You and Yours team decided to contact the companies that were listed in the emails as being owed money.  A spokesman for British Milerain Co Ltd, a waxed cotton fabric manufacturer, told the programme that the firm "had more than 150 calls from people who don't owe us money".  And a spokeswoman for Manchester shelving firm Greenoaks said: "My colleague took a call from an elderly gentleman and he was very distressed because his wife had had one of these emails."  Dr Steven Murdoch, principal research fellow at the department of computer science at University College London, told You and Yours: "Most likely it was a retailer or other internet site that had been hacked into and the database stolen, it then could have been sold or passed through several different people and then eventually it got to the person who sent out these emails."  He said that the email bore the hallmark of previous phishing attempts from gangs in Eastern Europe and Russia.  He said that clicking on the link would install malware such as Cryptolocker, which is a form of ransomware that will encrypt files on Windows-based computers and then demand a fee to unlock them.  Anyone receiving such an email is advised to delete it and report it to the national fraud and cybercrime reporting centre Action Fraud.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35979532	Huawei P9 uses Leica dual-lens camera tech to refocus	Huawei has unveiled an Android smartphone that uses dual-camera technology to let owners refocus photos after they have been taken.  The feature is the result of a collaboration between the Chinese tech firm and German camera-maker Leica.  It means the P9 can create shallow depth-of-field shots more commonly associated with larger lenses.  Analysts say the innovation could help Huawei promote itself as a premium brand and expand its market share.  The Shenzhen-based company shipped more than 106 million handsets in 2015, representing 44.3% growth on the previous year, according to the research firm IDC.  That was the fastest rise in sales of any of the major brands and put Huawei in third place in terms of market share.  However, Apple still sold more than double the number of phones and Samsung more than three times the figure.  "The camera is one of the things that defines a premium smartphone, and there's still plenty of room to improve the quality of the photography," commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy.  "And there are things you can do when you put two camera sensors on the back that you can't do with a single sensor."  Rather than offering users the ability to take two different types of photos- as is the case with LG's dual-camera G5 handset - the P9 combines the data from both its rear sensors to create its 12 megapixel shots.  One captures red, green and blue (RGB) information about the view, while the other is limited to collecting monochrome image data.  By making use of both types, the firm says, the phone can deliver better contrast and offer superior performance in low-light conditions.  But the standout feature is the ability to simulate wide-aperture photography - the effect of allowing more light into a lens in order to create a shallow depth-of-field.  A shallow depth-of-field can create striking photographs of a subject with a blurry background.  Photography enthusiasts often spend considerable sums on digital single-lens reflex cameras (DSLRs) and large lenses to create the look.  Unlike these larger cameras, the P9 also allows users to alter the part of the image they want to be in sharp focus after they have pressed the shutter button.  This is made possible by the fact that the phone's two lenses capture slightly different views, and built-in software can analyse the differences to deduce depth information.  The facility is only available in stills mode, however, and cannot be used to refocus captured videos.  Lytro previously tried to sell specialist cameras that offered a similar refocusing ability, however it recently gave up on the consumer market after acknowledging that the rise of smartphone photography had restricted its appeal.  One industry-watcher said that the tie-up with Leica should encourage potential buyers not to dismiss the dual-camera facility as being a gimmick.  "Leica is one of the strongest brands in photography, so having an association with them should make users believe that the quality of the pictures should be good," said Francisco Jeronimo, research director for European mobile devices at IDC.  "Of course, the quality of the image won't be the same as is possible from one of Leica's own cameras, but it does tell people that a company that really understands photography has been involved in engineering the device."  However, Mr Fogg added that Huawei would need to get its marketing right to make the most of the partnership.  "Leica isn't massively well known outside of serious camera enthusiasts," he explained.  "So, Huawei's challenge is how to communicate the benefit of the Leica brand to the general public as it is pushing the P9 as a mass-market flagship and not a niche device aimed at just the camera-centric few."  Other features of the P9 include:  It will cost between 599 euros ($682; £485) and 649 euros when it goes on sale on 16 April, depending on how much RAM and built-in storage is desired.  The firm is also offering a larger P9 Plus model, which has a 5.5in screen and a bigger battery. It will cost 749 euros.  These mark a jump in cost over last year's P8 family, which ranged from 499 to 649 euros.	tech

A database posted online this week is reported to have included people's names, ID numbers and addresses.  Turkish Justice Minister Bekir Bozdag was quoted by local media as saying the number of people was comparable to those on the electoral register.  The communications minister has denied there was any such breach recently.  Pro-government newspaper the Daily Sabah reported news of an investigation on Wednesday.  "Where this was leaked from, finding out how it was leaked, is what the investigation needs to focus on," Mr Bozdag was quoted as saying.  However, Turkish news site Milliyet published a statement from Communications Minister Binali Yildirim in which he said the leak was "a very old story" and the reports were "not newsworthy".  In total, the database reportedly contains details of just under 50 million people. The population of Turkey is estimated at 78 million.  The data is also reported to include individuals' birth dates and parents' names.  The 1.5 gigabyte cache of data was "partially verified" by the Associated Press news agency.  This was achieved by comparing 10 non-public Turkish ID numbers against names in the database, resulting in eight matches, the agency said.  A message on a site hosting the allegedly leaked data reads: "Who would have imagined that backwards ideologies, cronyism and rising religious extremism in Turkey would lead to a crumbling and vulnerable technical infrastructure?

A Commission spokesman told the BBC it was still waiting for information from the British government.  It cannot begin its assessment as it has yet to receive a final estimate of the flood damage.  The news means any EU payout to help repair damage is likely to be many months away.  Labour said the situation was a "total shambles" and money could already have been made available if the government had acted more quickly.  Britain had provided only a provisional estimate, putting the total cost at £1.7bn.  Ministers confirmed they were to make an application to the EU Solidarity Fund in February.  Once the Commission has received the information it has six weeks to make a decision, but the European Parliament and the European Council both have to give their approval.  A government spokesman said it had already paid out £250m of support to flood victims and the application to the EU fund would take time.  Sixteen thousand homes were flooded in December and January, with Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cumbria in England and central and north-east Scotland among the worst affected.  A European Commission spokeswoman said: "The UK government presented the case as a regional disaster with total direct damage provisionally estimated at £1.7bn.  "It should be noted that the UK considers their damage estimates as provisional and announced that updated data will be provided as soon as possible.  "The assessment of the application by the Commission can only be completed once the updated damage figures have been provided."  The Commission stressed the EU solidarity fund was not designed to provide a rapid response but was there for long term restoration.  A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "As set out in Parliament nearly six weeks ago we made clear we were applying and are now in the process of collating and submitting the detailed information the Commission requires alongside our application.  "This will take time as communities continue to make claims under our recovery schemes and the damage to infrastructure continues to be assessed - councils, departments and devolved administrations will need to supply their final costs as they become available."  Any EU payment would be made to the British government which would then decide how to spend the money.  In 2008 the UK received around £120m from the EU to help repair damage caused by heavy floods.  The shadow floods minister Alex Cunningham said: "This is a total shambles. David Cameron urgently needs to get a grip and finalise the UK's application for funding to help communities devastated by the floods.  "Up to £23m could already have been made available to help British homes and businesses through the EU Solidarity Fund with the potential for millions more in further payouts."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35977220	Messaging app Kik opens chatbot store	Messaging app Kik has launched an online store for chatbots, to allow brands to talk to users via bots.  Chatbots - computer programs designed to simulate conversation with humans - are increasingly being seen as a key way to engage customers.  Kik, which has 275 million users, has signed up 16 partners including make-up store Sephora and The Weather Channel.  Microsoft opened a chatbot store last week and Facebook is expected to follow suit.  In Kik's store, users will be able to download bots for entertainment, customer service and shopping.  Developers will also be able to access the platform to build bots on behalf of brands.  Other businesses signed up include video app Vine, fashion store H&M and comedy website Funny or Die.  Mike Roberts, Kik's head of messenger services, told Adweek: "Messengers are the new browser and bots are the new websites."  Messaging apps such as Kik, WhatsApp and WeChat are rapidly becoming the preferred methods of communication for young people - and about 40% of Kik's user base is aged 18 to 24.  Retailers and brands are seeing the huge potential of messaging apps as distribution channels.  Chatbots allow brands and retailers to interact with customers but their creators say they can also benefit consumers, offering personalised recommendations, completing purchases and tracking orders.  They are not without risk though. Last week Microsoft was forced to remove its artificial intelligence chatbot Tay from Twitter after users taught it to deny the Holocaust and swear.  The software giant remains convinced that the future will be about people talking to chatbots and at its Build conference unveiled a set of tools to let anyone create one.  It demonstrated how the system could be used to order a pizza and make a hotel booking.  It is widely rumoured that Facebook will open a chatbot store on Messenger at its F8 conference next week.  The firm is already developing an all-purpose digital assistant for its messaging app, called M. The aim will be for M to book flights and complete other tasks using a combination of artificial intelligence and human input.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35972431	Elections 2016: What Jeremy Corbyn has to do to survive	"There are two things I am not mentioning on the doorstep at the local elections in my area", a former Labour frontbencher confided to me. "Europe. And Corbyn."  The former because it might motivate otherwise disillusioned or dormant UKIP supporters to go the polls rather than just wait for the EU referendum in June.  And the latter because the settled view of some in the Parliamentary Labour Party is that Jeremy Corbyn's popularity among Labour's membership is not shared by the party's traditional voters.  So while local candidates will feature prominently on Labour's election literature, in some areas the national leader will not.  Indeed the fear amongst some of Mr Corbyn's own MPs is that he would repel rather than attract support.  So those of Corbyn critics who don't want to utter his name are motivated by the desire for Labour to do well in this set of elections.  But privately some in Labour's ranks have been wondering whether to "take the foot off the gas" when it comes to campaigning because a poorer result could convince some of the newer members of the party that Jeremy Corbyn is indeed unelectable in large parts of England, outside London.  This is the school of thought that believes if things are really going to get better for Labour - under a different leader - then first they have to get worse.  Here the battle of pre and post-election spin won't simply be fought between the parties, but within the Labour Party.  The widespread assumption is that Sadiq Khan will see off Zac Goldsmith in the contest for London Mayor.  He has kept his distance from Jeremy Corbyn - and some of his key backroom staff are exiles from Labour head office who found the new regime un-convivial.  But Mr Khan's victory, if it happens, will be hailed by Mr Corbyn's supporters as an important gain from the Conservatives.  Better still, they will embrace the Conservative attack that Sadiq Khan will be "Corbyn's man in City Hall".  Proof then, they will say, that even an unwelcome association with the Labour leader can help deliver votes, not drive them away.  Corbyn's critics are likely to point out that any win in London should be expected - the party gained seven points in London between the 2010 and 2015 general elections.  And even at the last mayoral election in 2012, Labour gained more votes than any other party in the simultaneous London assembly elections, with 42% of the vote to the Conservatives' 32%.  So the argument goes, Boris Johnson won the mayoralty partly because he is Boris Johnson - but partly because he was up against Jeremy Corbyn's left-wing fellow traveller Ken Livingstone.  At the other end of the UK, the spin will focus on a certain Labour defeat rather than an expected victory.  Polls suggest the SNP will gain another overall majority in the Scottish Parliament.  If Labour finish a poor second under the pro-Trident Kezia Dugdale, Jeremy Corbyn will pretty much escape any personal blame.  Just about everyone across Labour's political spectrum from pale pink to deepest red acknowledges that turning round the party's fortunes in Scotland will take time.  However, in the unlikely but not impossible event that Labour slips to third place in the Holyrood Parliament behind a confident Conservative contingent, the argument will be rather different.  Jeremy Corbyn's internal opponents will bring out the political skean dhus (see above). They will point out that his anti-austerity stance was supposed to win back recent defectors to the SNP.  They will say that while Kezia Dugdale is no Corbynista, she fought a campaign based on tax rises and opposition to public service cuts.  If that stance can't improve the party's standing in social democratically-inclined Scotland, what chance does it have south of the border?  And similarly anti-Corbyn voices will be raised if Labour loses its majority on the Welsh Assembly.  But the main battleground will be the English local elections - and the attempt to construct a prism through which the results here are viewed has already begun.  Those close to Jeremy Corbyn are already saying that judging their performance against the 2012 results, when most of these seats were last fought, is unfair - as it was a particularly good year for Ed Miliband, who had had 18 months as Labour leader by then.  Voters had gone to the polls with George Osborne's "omnishambles" Budget - with its pasty tax, its charity tax and the subsequent U-turns on both - fresh in their minds. Labour gained 500 seats in England then.  And the out-and-out opponents of Jeremy Corbyn are already setting this year's bar high - suggesting that at this stage in the electoral cycle Labour should be making more than 400 gains.  Meanwhile, a new analysis by the two leading academics - Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher - who study council by-election results suggests that, based on Labour's recent performance, the party could be on course to lose 150 seats.  But circulating among some in the Labour leader's shadow ministerial team is an analysis by YouGov's Marcus Roberts - formerly of Labour think tank the Fabian Society.  He has pointed out that - apart from general election years - Labour has only come behind the Conservatives twice in council elections when in opposition in the past four decades.  That was in 1982 - under the shadow of the Falklands conflict and the SDP split - and in 1985, amid the miners' strike and very public battles with the ultra-left Militant Tendency.  Even in Michael Foot's first year as leader the party gained 98 seats.  Mr Roberts says Labour should - by historical standards - be looking to pick up about 300 seats.  The party should be seeking to control councils such as Plymouth, where Labour lost parliamentary seats last year, and Pendle - which Ed Miliband visited on the eve of poll in the general election, but failed to win the next day.  Should Labour fall short of this benchmark, it's perfectly possible that some of Mr Corbyn's own shadow ministers could take to the airwaves and declare that it has - in that classic election programme phrase - been a "bad night for Labour".  Already some MPs who were close to either Gordon Brown or Tony Blair - or both - are weighing up a leadership challenge.  This wouldn't happen until after the June EU referendum, but poor results in the local elections would give them the ammunition.  Jeremy Corbyn's supporters are well aware of the manoeuvrings so apart from being prepared to "spin" bad results, they are organising to achieve rather better ones.  They won't talk openly of target councils but the website of Momentum - the self-declared "successor to the campaign to elect Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the Labour Party" - says it is "organising to support Labour candidates in the various May elections".  Now at one level, it would be odd if they weren't.  But their critics say they are not nearly as committed to campaigning for Britain to stay in the EU.  Some of Momentum's insiders say they will happily focus on that referendum, but only once the local elections are out of the way.  That's because they know good results in May could spike the guns of those who want to challenge Mr Corbyn and make a leadership contest appear bizarre.  And while many on the party's left may feel more motivated when campaigning for Labour candidates who are Momentum supporters, they won't be looking for ideological purity.  The winner of last year's Oldham West and Royton parliamentary by-election, Jim McMahon, is not regarded as particularly left wing but Momentum packed five buses full of supporters from five different cities - about 150 people - to campaign for him, and Labour's share of the vote went up on a turnout of 39%.  Similar targeting of effort in council elections - which also tend to have low turnouts, often in the low 30s - might help make crucial gains or stave off potential losses.  The Labour slogan for the campaign is "standing up, not standing by".  It seems some of the party's MPs will be standing up to - and not standing by - their leader if he and his supporters fail to deliver reasonable results.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35969739	Whatsapp adds end-to-end encryption	Instant messaging service Whatsapp has announced it will encrypt all its users' communications from Tuesday.  With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled as they leave the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the recipient's device.  It renders messages unreadable if they are intercepted, for example by criminals or law enforcement.  Whatsapp, which has a billion users worldwide, said file transfers and voice calls would be encrypted too.  The Facebook-owned company said protecting private communication was one of its "core beliefs".  Encryption was thrown under the spotlight after the FBI asked Apple to help it access data on an iPhone used by California gunman Syed Farook.  Whatsapp said: "The idea is simple: when you send a message, the only person who can read it is the person or group chat that you send that message to. No one can see inside that message. Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us."  Users with the latest version of the app were notified about the change when sending messages on Tuesday. The setting is enabled by default.  "Whatsapp's roll out of the Signal Protocol, providing end to end encryption for its one billion users worldwide, is a major boost for people's ability to express themselves and communicate without fear," the organisation said in a statement.  "This is a huge victory for privacy and free speech, especially for activists and journalists who depend on strong and trustworthy communications to carry out their work without putting their lives at greater risk."  Whatsapp's decision was also welcomed by security professionals.  "Wire-tappers lament, law-abiding citizens rejoice, for WhatsApp's latest update is a victory for communications privacy," said Lee Munson, a security researcher for Comparitech.  "With the ability to access data removed even from the company behind the app, only ill-informed law enforcement agencies are likely to mutter 'terrorists' as the masses enjoy the encrypted text messages, photos, video and phone calls they've been demanding ever since Edward Snowden blew the lid on government surveillance."  The move is likely to irk law enforcement agencies, particularly the US Department of Justice which has recently expressed concern over "unreachable" information contained in devices. The DoJ did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Tuesday.  Other messaging apps with end-to-end encryption include Telegram, which is known to be used by the so-called Islamic State to share information.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35965499	Corbyn: Council polls can be 'turning point' for Labour	Jeremy Corbyn has said he wants May's English council elections to mark a "turning point" in Labour's fortunes.  Launching its campaign, he said Labour must stand up against cuts to services and show a different way of running the country "for the good of all".  He criticised the government's record on housing, benefit cuts and low pay and plans for more academy schools.  The 5 May elections are the first UK-wide ballot box test for Mr Corbyn since his election last September.  As well as the local authority elections in England, polls are also being held for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations as well as to elect a London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.  Labour made big gains at the expense of the Conservatives and Lib Dems the last time these seats on 124 councils in England were contested in 2012.  Mr Corbyn will be hoping to hang on to those gains and make progress in the south of England and the Midlands - areas where Labour did poorly in last year's general election - to silence internal criticism of the party's electability under his leadership.  In a speech in Labour-controlled Harlow, Mr Corbyn said he was the first Labour leader for 80 years who had served as a councillor and had personal experience of the role they played.  Accusing Conservative town halls of stripping out services and turning many areas into "cultural deserts", he said a Labour council was "the best protection" against an "onslaught" of cuts.  A visit to Bristol had shown him people being "socially cleansed out of a community they have lived in for many, many years" due to rising rents, with the same happening in cities across the country, he said.  Labour councils, Mr Corbyn said, were "standing up" for residents by introducing a "genuine living wage" for town hall staff and insisting it is matched by council contractors.  "Even in the toughest of times it is Labour councils that are making better choices."  He praised Labour town halls' record on building council housing but argued more needs to be done across the country to increase the supply of affordable homes.  He urged activists to take Labour's message to "every doorstep" in the country.  "Let May 5 be the turning point when Labour grew, Labour got support and Labour showed there is a different, much better way of running this country for the good of all not just for the benefit of the very few wealthy people who have had it easy for too long."  In the speech, he also urged the government to "act now to save the steel industry" by bringing forward £35bn of infrastructure projects using British steel.  "This industry is too important to our manufacturing economy and our security to fail," he said.  "This government's ideological allergy to public ownership is stopping it taking the steps needed to save steel."  The Conservatives hit back at Mr Corbyn's attack on their housing policies, saying the government had doubled the housing budget with the number of new homes up by 25% in the past year.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said: 'The Labour Party left the lowest level of housebuilding since the 1920s and has opposed every measure this government has taken to boost ownership and supply."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35969735	What is a warrant canary?	In March, online community Reddit killed its "warrant canary" - a statement on its website declaring that it had not received any secret data snooping requests from government or law enforcement agencies.  While the site has remained quiet about its canary's demise, it has hosted a discussion on the subject by a group of lawyers.  A warrant canary is a statement saying a company has not received secret requests for user data by government or law enforcement officers.  It is named after the birds that were taken down mineshafts to alert workers to toxic gases.  If the canary died in the mine the workers knew they had to leave quickly.  Similarly, the existence of a warrant canary on a website indicates the "all clear". When it disappears, visitors might assume the website has received classified requests for data.  Many websites publish a warrant canary in an effort to be transparent with visitors. The concept gained popularity after the extent of US government surveillance was revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden.  In the US, law enforcement can issue requests for user data that come with a gagging order, preventing the demand from being disclosed.  Demands known as national security letters are designed to allow law enforcement agencies to conduct an investigation without interference or alerting the target.  But critics say the confidential nature of national security letters, which can be issued without a court order, makes them ripe for abuse by law enforcement.  Reddit, Adobe and Tumblr are among the sites that have published warrant canaries.  The disappearance of a warrant canary usually only reveals that a website has received at least one secret surveillance request. They are often written in broad terms, as their legality has not been tested in court.  "The more practically useful and informative they are, the more legally risky they are too," said Brett Max Kaufman, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union.  Before it was killed, Reddit's warrant canary said: "Reddit has never received a National Security Letter, an order under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or any other classified request for user information."  One Reddit member asked whether websites could print an individual warrant canary on every member's profile, making it immediately obvious when a specific user had been targeted by a secret request.  "The government would have a pretty strong argument in that case that the removal of the individual's canary was simply an end-run around the gag order, and that it would jeopardise the government interests in completing its investigation without interference," said Mr Kaufman.  "That's not to say an individualised canary could never be lawful."  While the disappearance of a warrant canary could indicate that a company has received a classified data request, it remains possible that Reddit removed the canary to avoid a future fight over its legality.  "I strongly suspect it is the first," said Alex Abdo of the ACLU.  "Unless they received a national security request, nothing else would have changed between the 2014 transparency report and now.  "If they abandoned it for the second reason, Reddit likely would not have issued the very cryptic statement that they could not comment on the disappearance of the canary."  Reddit did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.  One Reddit member questioned whether the government could force a website to falsely keep its warrant canary online, disguising the existence of a national security letter.  "If the government asked a company to leave its warrant canary up (and therefore communicate something false to the public), the company would have the right to challenge any gag (under the First Amendment... or under certain provisions of the USA Freedom Act) in court," said Mr Kaufman.  "But if a court upheld the government's request... the public would be none the wiser, at least for some time.  "Indeed, that would be the entire objective from the government's perspective."  When asked whether the disappearance of Reddit's canary was a cause for alarm, Mr Abdo said it was "difficult to know".  "It's possible that the request was very targeted and in pursuit of someone we would all agree should be investigated," he said.  "But we don't know the facts at this point, and we don't even know which legal authority the government was relying on.  "And we might not know either of those things for a long time."	tech

Peter Byrne contacted the firm as tremors caused by his condition meant he kept hitting the standard controller's touchpad, pausing games.  Alex Nawabi from Sony's marketing team said he would investigate.  He then modified a Dual Shock 4 controller himself and sent it to Mr Byrne as a surprise.  On the bespoke version, the touchpad has been disabled and its button re-routed to the back of the device.  In a letter to Mr Byrne, who lives in New Jersey in the US, Mr Nawabi said it took him around 10 hours and three attempts to create his solution.  He said he had undertaken the work on his own initiative and told Mr Byrne it would not be covered by the warranty.  "I'm not 100% sure how long it will last, as it's the first time I've ever done anything like this," he wrote.  "I have plans to build you one more controller in case this one breaks but I'd like feedback on this one first."  Mr Nawabi added that Mr Byrne's email had "struck a chord" with him.  "It killed me to hear how something you used to enjoy thoroughly was being ruined because of our new controller design," he wrote.  Mr Byrne said he was delighted with his new controller.  "Honestly, I expected them to just make a note of my issue and say 'we'll address this in the future'," he told the BBC.  "It works very good so far. I have no problems and gameplay has been fine".  Mr Byrne's story attracted the attention of local news outlet News12 New Jersey (subscription site) after he posted pictures of the letter and his controller on Facebook and it was shared widely.  Sony has been contacted by the BBC.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35969734	Wikimedia Sweden art map 'violated copyright'	A website documenting public artworks in Sweden violated copyright laws, the country's supreme court has ruled.  Visitors to the Offentlig Konst site could browse a map detailing public sculptures, statues and paintings.  But the Visual Copyright Society in Sweden (Bus) sued Wikimedia Sweden, the site's owners, for providing free access to a database of art photographs without the artists' consent.  Wikimedia Sweden said it was greatly disappointed by the ruling.  The non-profit organisation, set up to support and promote Wikimedia projects such as Wikipedia in Sweden, has a collection of royalty-free photographs that it says can be used by the public.  But the supreme court said that while individuals were allowed to take photographs of public artwork, providing those images in a database for unlimited use was "an entirely different matter".  "Such a database can be assumed to have a commercial value that is not insignificant," the court said in a statement.  "The court finds that the artists are entitled to that value."  Wikimedia Sweden said the decision showed that the country's copyright laws were "lagging behind the times" and not adequate for the "digital reality we all live in today".  It warned that tourists taking selfies in front of famous landmarks and sharing them online could be judged to have violated copyright laws.  Jim Killock, executive director of the UK-based Open Rights Group, said: "Freedom of panorama is essential for ordinary photographers in the digital age."  "You cannot possibly know if a building or public artwork is within copyright term. Banning such photos risks making copyright farcical and will bring it into disrepute.  "Just as importantly, these laws need to be consistent across the EU."  The amount of damages Wikimedia Sweden must pay Bus will be decided by a Stockholm district court at a later date.	tech

It blamed its own "hubris" for overloading the Model X with technology.  It revealed that it delivered 14,820 cars in the first quarter, falling short of the expected 16,000.  It comes after the firm revealed that its new Model 3 car already has 276,000 pre-orders.  The carmaker said that it had delivered 12,420 Model S sedans and 2,400 Model X SUVs in the first quarter of 2016.  In a statement, Tesla added that its Q1 delivery count was "impacted by severe Model X supplier parts shortages in January and February that lasted much longer than initially expected".  It said that once "issues were resolved", production and delivery rates "improved dramatically".  "By the last full week of March, the build rate rose to 750 Model X vehicles per week, however many of these vehicles were built too late to be delivered to their owners before end of the quarter."  It was frank about the reasons for the delay: "The root causes of the parts shortages were: Tesla's hubris in adding far too much technology to the Model X in version one, insufficient supplier capability validation and Tesla not having broad enough capability to manufacture the parts in-house."  Back in February, Elon Musk admitted that the car had been "over-engineered".  The shortage involved about six out of the 8,000 parts that go into the Model X but Tesla did not specify which ones.  It has raised doubts about how prepared Tesla will be to deliver its new Model 3 car which was announced to much fanfare last week.  The basic model will sell for $35,000 (£24,423) - less than half the cost of Tesla's previous models - and has a range of at least 215 miles per charge.  The car is due to go on sale in late 2017 and customers must put down a $1,000 (£704) deposit. It can be ordered in advance to dozens of countries, including the UK, Brazil, India, China and New Zealand.  Mr Musk has revealed that the company is focusing on ramping up productions and will eventually need to build a factory in Europe to satisfy demand.  Stephanie Brinley, a senior analyst with research firm IHS, said that it was crucial that it gets production of the new vehicle right.  "Given its history of missed deadlines, this one needs to be met, to earn the faith of consumers and investors alike," she said.  Last year Tesla posted a net loss of $889m (£620m) for 2015, partly because of the large sum it spent on research and development.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35968102	Barclays bank joins Apple Pay in UK	UK-based Barclays customers can now use Apple Pay, nine months after the digital wallet service was first launched in the country.  Barclays had been the biggest UK lender not to support the facility.  The bank offers rival facilities of its own - including bPay and Pingit - but had faced pressure from some customers to support Apple's effort.  However, Barclays said it had no plans to join Android Pay or Samsung Pay when they come to the UK later this year.  "We are passionate about helping customers access services and carry out their day-to-day transactions in the way that suits them," said Barclays UK's chief executive Ashok Vaswani.  "Adding to the existing choice, from today both Barclays debit and Barclaycard credit card customers can use Apple Pay to make payments with their Apple device across the UK."  When questioned about its lack of commitment to similar services for Android-based handsets and tablets, a spokeswoman noted the bank already provided a way to take advantage of the devices' NFC (near field communication) chips.  "In January this year, we introduced a contactless mobile payment feature to the Barclaycard Android app that allows customers with an Android phone to make contactless payments for £30 and under, and at some retailers for up to £100, using their mobile device," she explained.  "Alongside this they can manage their account on the go and have lost, stolen and damaged cards instantly replaced on to their phone."  At present, Apple does not allow third-party apps to make use of the NFC chips in its devices.  Apple Pay allows debit and credit card details to be added to an iPhone, iPad and/or Apple Watch. The devices can subsequently stand in for the physical cards at contactless payment terminals.  In addition, it can be used as a way to pay for goods within compatible apps without a user having to type in the linked card's three or four-digit security code.  Apple has yet to disclose any data about how widely the service has been used since it was launched in the UK in July 2015.  However, the Memo news site recently reported that that just 0.4% of Transport for London's daily pay-as-you-go journeys had used the service over the last six months of 2015 despite support for Apple Pay being publicised at Tube stations.  Even so, one expert said it would be wrong to suggest it had flopped.  "The adoption of device-based payments will be more of a marathon than a sprint," said Ben Wood from the CCS Insight tech consultancy.  "The tech firms have to get consumers to engage in a behavioural change away from using their cards and cash.  "But Apple Pay - and Android Pay - are already in a strong position given the amount of support they are getting."  Apple's recent introduction of the iPhone SE could also help.  It is the US firm's first entry-level handset to feature a fingerprint sensor, allowing the smartphone to support Apple Pay.  Several of the smaller UK lenders that do not yet support the service have also indicated their desire to join.  Metro Bank told the BBC it intended to join Apple Pay within a few months, while Virgin Money said it was looking into adopting it later.  "The banks have felt they had to support Apple Pay and similar services for use at stores' contactless card terminals," commented Dave Birch, a payments specialist at Consult Hyperion.  "But I personally think all of these payment mechanisms will eventually be subsumed into applications.  "In the future, when you go to Tesco's - for example - you will pay via a Tesco app, and it will use Barclays bPay, Apple Pay, PayPal or whatever."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35965495	Ministers' language 'undermines human rights work', MPs say	Ministers are creating a "perception" that human rights are not a priority for the government, MPs say.  The Foreign Affairs Committee said the government gave the impression of prioritising trade and security with China, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.  This was despite a doubling in funding for the Foreign Office's dedicated human rights project.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said improving human rights was a "core function of the Foreign Office".  But the committee's chairman, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, said: "The actions and words of ministers in the Foreign Office have undermined the excellent human rights work carried out by the department.  "This needs to be remedied."  Giving evidence to the committee in October, Sir Simon McDonald, the Foreign Office's most senior civil servant, said human rights was "not one of our top priorities".  This was strongly rejected by ministers, but the committee said written evidence it received suggested there was "plainly a perception that this has occurred".  The committee welcomed the doubling of funding for the department's human rights programme, called the Magna Carta Fund for Human Rights and Democracy, to £10.6m.  But it said the decision to restrict the fund to registered organisations "acts against an intelligent deployment of resources".  The MPs criticised remarks by Middle East Minister Tobias Ellwood, who told the committee he could not remember whether he had raised human rights during a visit to Egypt with a business delegation.  "We are disappointed by the parliamentary under-secretary of state's choice of language on this occasion and others, which raises questions about how energetically the government is raising human rights issues," the MPs said.  And they said the Foreign Office had failed to send an "important message" by not including Egypt and Bahrain on a list of "Human Rights Priority Countries", saying this "contributes to the perception that the [Foreign Office] has become more hesitant in promoting and defending international human rights openly and robustly, notwithstanding the importance of private diplomacy".  The department should be "more mindful of the perceptions it creates at ministerial level" in its dealings with China, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, the report said, because "perceptions and symbols matter."  It also said the the department's failure to fly the rainbow flag - an international symbol of equality - for the London Pride event in 2015 "sent a message that contradicts much of the actual work and objectives" of the department.  And it suggested the Foreign Office's human rights work should be presented in a more "user-friendly fashion" so it can be evaluated more easily.  Mr Hammond said: "I do not recognise this characterisation of our human rights work."  The UK supports over 75 human rights projects in more than 40 countries, he said, adding that the doubling of funding for the projects was "a true measure of the importance we attach to this agenda".  He added: "By mainstreaming human rights within the Foreign Office, we have ensured it will always be a central part of our diplomacy, delivering tangible results."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35956858	Steel crisis: Unions to urge ministers to support plan	Unions are to urge ministers to agree a plan aimed at saving thousands of steel jobs after a day of emergency meetings.  The proposals were drawn up after talks with Tata Steel, which plans to sell its UK plants.  Unions called on David Cameron to intervene to prevent the closure of Tata's Port Talbot plant, accusing Business Secretary Sajid Javid of "taking his eye off the ball".  Government sources said Mr Javid was in "full control" of the situation.  The business department he leads is in "full crisis mode", they added.  On Twitter, Mr Javid said he had held a "productive" meeting with Tata executives, adding: "Progress is being made."  Tata Steel announced last week it was selling its loss-making UK businesses and would close its plant at Port Talbot unless a buyer was found.  The company directly employs 15,000 workers in the UK and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  Who might buy Tata in Port Talbot?  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  Ministers said they were optimistic that a buyer would be found for the whole business.  One potential buyer told the BBC he could take over all of the business without mass job losses.  Sanjeev Gupta, the head of the Liberty Group, said he had "very encouraging" talks with the UK government so far, but there was still a lot of work to do.  Mr Javid will travel to Mumbai on Tuesday to meet Tata chairman Cyrus Mistry for discussions about the sales process.  Beforehand he is due to meet union representatives, when he will be urged to back their plan for the future of the Tata sites.  It involves securing the customer base by guaranteeing production at Tata sites, not allowing Tata or other buyers to "cherry pick" parts of the business, and offering government support for two to three years while the industry gets "back to self-sustainability".  Speaking at the union talks in London, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey told the BBC Tata had expressed a desire to complete the sale "speedily", adding: "That's not really good enough if they want to be a responsible company."  He said Tata was "under some pressure from ourselves to do the right thing, not to just rush away in a matter of weeks" and called on the government to "put a protective arm around the industry".  BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said a pension fund covering 140,000 steel workers looked set to be "critical" to any sale.  A source involved with the Liberty House talks said the company and other potential buyers would regard taking on Tata's pension liabilities as "too big an ask".  Mr Javid, under pressure over his handling of the crisis, signalled on Sunday that ministers were working on plans to take on some of the pension liabilities and to reduce energy costs to make a purchase more attractive to investors.  But Norman Smith said there was concern that a government move to cover workers' pensions could flout EU state aid rules.  Unions say they wrote to Mr Cameron last week seeking a meeting and have not received a reply - but Downing Street said no correspondence had been received.  Roy Rickhuss, leader of the Community union, said: "By now, no-one underestimates the scale of the challenge we face. We have an entire industry to save and not a lot of time to save it.  "We must also ensure that we hold Tata to a commitment to be a responsible seller and honour its moral and social duties to UK steel communities."  Speaking on a visit to Tata's plant in Rotherham, Business Minister Anna Soubry said the government "will talk to anybody who has a genuine reputation and is genuinely interested" in the company's UK interests.  She said the government would do everything possible to secure the future of the industry in the UK.  Tata Steel has said there is "no fixed timeline" for the sale process but stressed that urgency is needed to avoid "a long period of uncertainty" for employees and customers.  Labour says the government should be prepared to take the Port Talbot plant - which Tata says is losing £1m a day - into public ownership to safeguard its future until a buyer can be found.  It also wants major projects involving large amounts of steel to be fast-tracked.  Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the future of British steel-making was "hanging in the balance" and accused the government of being "still missing in action".  Meanwhile Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones faced questions from assembly members over the steel crisis in a hastily reconvened meeting. He is expected to hold talks with Mr Cameron in Downing Street on Tuesday.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35959594	Revenge porn: Movie studios attack draft law	The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) has opposed draft "revenge porn" legislation that is being considered in Minnesota.  "Revenge porn" broadly describes the act of publishing explicit images of someone without their consent.  The MPAA said the Minnesota draft law could restrict the publication of "items of legitimate news, commentary, and historical interest".  But supporters of the proposal said its reach was "plainly legitimate".  Revenge porn commonly refers to the sharing of intimate images after the end of a relationship, but is also used in a broader sense to describe any publication of explicit images without consent, for example when private photographs of a celebrity are leaked online.  A number of countries and US states have introduced legislation that prohibits the practice, but there is no US-wide federal law on the subject.  Opponents of revenge porn legislation have argued that some of the new laws are too broad in scope, and that existing copyright, communication and harassment laws sufficiently cover the subject.  The MPAA, which represents six major Hollywood film studios, said the Minnesota law could "limit the distribution of a wide array of mainstream, constitutionally protected material".  It cited images of Holocaust victims and prisoners at Abu Ghraib as examples of images depicting nudity which are shared without the subjects' consent.  The MPAA called for the legislation to clarify that images shared without consent only broke the law if they were shared with an "intent to harass".  But the Cyber Civil Rights Initiative, which has campaigned for revenge porn to be made illegal, said an "intent to harass" provision would render the law "incoherent".  "It would allow people to distribute private, sexually explicit material of no public concern unless it could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that their motive was to harass," the organisation said in its response to the MPAA.  "The motive of a distributor has no bearing on whether the material is newsworthy or a matter of public concern.  "A photograph of a dirty restaurant kitchen is not rendered less newsworthy because the distributor intends to harass the restaurant owner."  If passed, the Minnesota law would become effective on 1 August.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35929741	Crypto-challenge: the answers	Last week, the BBC ran an article giving readers a series of crypto-based challenges to solve. Some of the questions and problems posed were straightforward, but a few were very tricky. Below are the solutions for the challenges that show how the codes can be broken.  Solving the first challenge was simply a case of matching the symbols, replacing letters in the questions by using the provided key. This helped fill in the missing words. Then it was a case of working out which answer of the three choices was correct.  1. Where was the centre of CODEBREAKING in WW2?  2. The man who designed the machine that CRACKED the ENIGMA CODE was...?  3. The fundamental BUILDING block of ELECTRONIC devices is the...?  This question involved what is known as a substitution cipher - and a simple one at that.  Each letter was given a number starting with A=0, B=1, C=2 etc.  Applying that to the short sequence of numbers reveals the answer to be: Fibonacci Sequence.  The clue to getting this one right was in the picture.  It showed Julius Caesar, who was believed to have used codes that shifted each letter a few places to the right or left.  In the scheme we used, letters were moved three places to the right. The alphabet wraps round, so A=X, B=Y, C=Z and so on.  This gives the answer: Up his sleevies.  Some codes, such as this one, do away with letters and numbers and instead use symbols.  This type of cipher is known as a pig-pen cipher and each symbol relates to a position in a pre-prepared grid. The letters of the alphabet are distributed through this grid.  Below is the way we chose to arrange the letters of the alphabet.  Applying this arrangement revealed the text to be: In the 18th century Freemasons used pig pen ciphers to keep their private records.  This code certainly stepped up the complexity, although there was a clue in the accompanying image.  Each number corresponds to the atomic number of an element.  Replacing the numbers with the initial letter of the element they represent should reveal the text below:  The periodic table is a tabular arrangement of the chemical elements, organised on the basis of their atomic numbers, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. We've used it to create a cipher by using the initial letters of the elements, but two letters can't be used. What are they?  The answer to the question posed in the revealed text is: J and Q.  The final three challenges were genuinely difficult and required lateral thinking to work out how the text had been enciphered in the first place.  The numbers in puzzle one were for hexadecimal encoded Ascii characters. However, simply converting them back to the more familiar letters and punctuation marks would not give the answer.  Instead, it gave a string that had also been enciphered. It used a Caesar cipher that shifted the letters 13 places along the alphabet.  Reversing this change revealed the following text: "We're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad." "How do you know I'm mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."  Puzzle two was a bit of a beast. The key, literally, was using the five numbers arranged around the pentagon in the picture.  Starting at 3 and going clockwise gives the five character string 38108. Repeating this 29 times gives a string 145-characters long, the same length as the one below the pentagon.  Getting intelligible text out of this first requires using both strings and then performing what is known as an "exclusive or" (XOR) operation on them.  This website can help.  Performing this operation produces another 145-character string that can be converted into English by looking up the numbers on a table of Ascii characters. Use the decimal column.  The sneaky part was realising that in some cases two numbers represented a character and in others it was three. Not easy.  Anyone who went through these steps would reveal the following text: 'It's a poor sort of memory that only works backwards.'  By contrast to the preceding puzzle, number three was pretty straightforward once you worked out that the different types of pawns on the board represented the dots and dashes of Morse code.  Applying this revealed the message to be: Off with their heads.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35955546	Steel crisis: Sanjeev Gupta in talks over Port Talbot sale	Steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta has held preliminary talks with the government over the possible purchase of Port Talbot steelworks, the BBC understands.  A source close to Mr Gupta said the discussions had not been substantive but he would seek further talks when he flies back to the UK early next week.  Government help on energy costs and plant modernisation are issues he wants to discuss, according to a source.  It comes as the government said it was ready to offer financial support to "clinch a buyer" to save the steelworks, where more than 4,000 jobs are at risk.  Tata Steel - which announced last week that it was selling its loss-making UK businesses - has said it will close the plant unless it finds a buyer.  German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp has also been touted as another potential buyer, according to reports.  Tata directly employs 15,000 workers in the UK and supports thousands of others, across plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  It said it was "committed to running a meaningful process to explore strategic alternatives" for its UK business.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Is China to blame for steel woes?  Mr Gupta's commodities firm Liberty House has already saved several UK steelworks.  A source close to the businessman said he was "definitely interested" in Tata's "downstream" operations and was looking at options which would keep liquid steel-making in the UK.  BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said Mr Gupta wanted to discuss possible government help to replace Port Talbot's traditional blast furnaces with modern electric arc furnaces and energy costs.  The source said it would not be an open-ended commitment, would protect most of the jobs at the site and could make it more profitable in the long term.  Extra relief from carbon tax is another important issue, according to the source.  On Sunday's Andrew Marr show, Business Secretary Sajid Javid said he would rule nothing out, but he maintained the government's view that nationalisation was not the answer to the crisis.  It wants to find a commercial buyer for the Port Talbot plant, saying this will offer a "long-term, viable future".  Mr Javid signalled that ministers were working on plans to reduce energy costs and take on some of the pension liabilities to make a purchase more attractive to investors.  Tata Steel has said there is "no fixed timeline" for the sale process but stressed that urgency is needed to avoid "a long period of uncertainty" employees and customers.  It said the sale process began on 30 March and added: "Tata Steel Europe is in the process of finalising the appointment of advisers and will soon launch a process globally of seeking an investor for the UK operations."  Labour says the government should be prepared to take the Port Talbot plant - which Tata says is losing £1m a day - into public ownership to safeguard its future until a buyer can be found.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested the government could maintain a stake in the plant after a sale.  He has also urged ministers to speed up infrastructure projects, such as HS2, to support the steel industry and encourage investment.  Mr Javid - who was criticised for being in Australia during Tata's crunch meeting in Mumbai last Tuesday - admitted that Tata's announcement had caught the government by surprise  He said the government had known "a few weeks ago" that Tata was reviewing its UK operations and persuaded it not to go ahead with the immediate closure of Port Talbot - but its decision to sell off its UK assets had gone "much further than we expected".  Mr McDonnell said Mr Javid should not continue in his role as business secretary.  He told the Radio 4's World This Weekend programme someone "more dynamic" and "effective" was needed.  Ministers have faced criticism for failing to take more action to prevent the "dumping" of cheap Chinese steel - selling it cheaply at a loss - seen as one of the key reasons for the problems in the UK steel industry.  On Marr, Mr Javid said the UK had been "the leader" in pushing for action on tariffs but he said protectionism "is in no-one's interests".  Elsewhere, the government has played down the impact of new Chinese import tariffs of up to 46.3%.  David Cameron and Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones will meet on Tuesday to discuss the situation.	politics

She's from Africa	Back in 2008, South African physicist Neil Turok gave a speech in which he declared his wish that the next Einstein would be from Africa.  It was a rallying call for investment in maths and physics research in Africa. The "Next Einstein" slogan became a mission for the organisation Neil Turok had founded to bring Africa into the global scientific community: the African Institute of Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).  That search for an African Einstein now has some results, with 15 "Next Einstein Fellows" and 54 "Next Einstein Ambassadors" announced at an event last month.  These are young African scientists, often leaders in their fields, working and studying in Africa.  "Einstein is a natural, easy role model for people to look at - not just because he was a spectacular scientist, but also he thought about the way we should care for social justice as well as science," says the 36-year-old South African cosmologist Amanda Weltman, speaking to the BBC Discovery programme.  Her work on the Chameleon field, a way to explain the accelerated expansion of the universe, is seen as a continuation of Einstein's work.  "Where Einstein triggered all these completely new ideas and brought about revolution, that's what we want to do. It's not necessarily to be that person, but to be revolutionary and fearless," Dr Weltman adds.  When Neil Turok made his declaration, he wasn't thinking so much of a literal African Einstein, but of creating opportunities to nurture young scientific leaders who would challenge the stereotypes of Africa and champion its development through science.  "There is a huge youth demographic in Africa and this will get bigger; 40% of the world's youth will be African by 2050," he says.  "Many scientists around the world are more than happy to come to Africa for a few weeks a year and share their knowledge and insights with the most able young Africans."  The apparent gap between studying maths or physics and Africa's needs - in public health and disease control, for example - might seem huge. But one branch of science can inform another.  Thierry Zomahoun, the CEO of AIMS, cites the example of the west African Ebola outbreak, where local work on mathematical modelling of the virus might have slowed the spread of the disease at an earlier stage.  "It's urgent for mathematical epidemiologists to be trained on the continent, for lab technicians to be trained so that we don't have to invest billions of dollars paying expatriate technicians from France or the US to do the work that we could have done here," he said.  Mr Zomahoun is also the chair of the Next Einstein Forum - an AIMS initiative which held a gathering in March in Dakar, Senegal, both to celebrate the Next Einstein Fellows and to raise the political profile of the need for investment in scientific research in Africa.  Rwanda's President Paul Kagame was one of the speakers.  "We cannot be satisfied with just ending extreme poverty. Our aim is shared and sustainable prosperity and the key to that is science and innovation," he told the conference.  Foreign donors, especially former colonial powers, have played a big part historically in developing African education - particularly in science - but have also dictated what kind of research is done.  That model is changing, says Evelyn Gitau, adding that her Kenya-based research into cellular immunology and malaria is only possible because of large-scale funding and a hands-off approach from the UK's Wellcome Trust.  In order to own scientific progress, Dr Gitau says, African governments must get more involved.  "African governments have to change how they think. Travel grants are great, but $10 to $20,000 is not going to fund research at the cutting-edge level."  From the beginning, AIMS had a funding policy which compelled African governments to step up to the plate. Its institutes get half their funding from the governments of the countries in which they are based - South Africa, Tanzania, Ghana, Senegal, Cameroon - and the rest from foreign governments and private foundations.  New AIMS institutes are planned for Morocco and also Rwanda.  Rwanda styles itself as the place to do business in Africa, making it easy to set up there, especially for entrepreneurs from other African countries.  It sits, however, in a region with a history of instability and autocratic government. That doesn't sound like a place for free-thinking scientists to thrive.  This is an issue Neil Turok is only too aware of.  "This does not mean we are an instrument of the Rwandan government. AIMS is all about freedom - it's about freedom to learn, freedom to express opinions... Science is all about critical thinking. Nothing we do will compromise that," he says.  "We feel by getting involved in Rwanda now, we can be on the side of progress."  Africa might seem an unlikely destination for high-end scientific research, but this is becoming a reality and the continent has some natural scientific advantages.  Amada Weltman cites the example of the Square Kilometre Array - the world's largest radio telescope, currently under construction. This "south south" project (the second section of it is in Australia) could not have been built in more densely industrialised countries, due to the amount of radio-wave pollution in their skies.  "We didn't get that project just because of some sort of sympathy towards Africa. We consider the night sky as a resource, where Africa is perhaps more empowered than the global north, which is already overly polluted with radio waves. So this gives us a fresh angle to how we think about the universe."  There are advantages in other fields, too. For scientists using bioinformatics to explore the origins of genetic disease, Africa holds a unique place as the cradle of humanity - and therefore the repository of our oldest genetic information.  The continent's future scientific development could have a profound impact on the future of mankind.  Julian Siddle's radio documentary on the Next Einstein initiative will air on the BBC World Service at 22:30 GMT on Monday and is available to download now.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35924858	From punch cards to smartphones	After World War II, Britain was a hotbed of pioneering computer research. Work done on automatic ways to crack codes and spot enemy aircraft meant it had a skilled cadre of engineers and scientists equipped with the knowledge to create powerful and practical computers.  The machines that resulted, the Manchester Mark I, Edsac and the Ace, are now well known. Even Colossus, a secret during wartime and for decades after, is now widely recognised as the world's first programmable, electronic digital computer.  But not all the UK's pioneers and pioneering computers are as well-known. This week The National Museum of Computing in Bletchley Park is putting on display one machine, the HEC-1, that was recently discovered in the stores of the Birmingham Museums Trust. It was very popular and successful in its day but is poorly appreciated today.  This is ironic in the case of its creator Dr Andrew Booth because, said Dr Roger Johnson, one of the innovations he came up with is ubiquitous today more than 60 years after it was invented.  The innovation is the Booth multiplier that helps to speed up some types of calculation performed by a central processing unit in a computer as it handles data.  "There are hundreds of them in a smartphone," said Dr Booth. "In any chip that has a multiplier, the overwhelming majority will be a Booth multiplier."  Nothing that Edsac creator Maurice Wilkes worked on, nor anything that Tom Kilburn and Freddie Williams in Manchester created has had such a lasting impact, said Dr Johnson who has spent years uncovering and compiling information about Dr Andrew Booth's work.  Booth started as a crystallographer at Birkbeck College and turned to automatic calculating machines to help do the complex maths involved in this work. Through his boss at Birkbeck, JD Bernal, he got a six-month Rockefeller Scholarship to Princeton which he spent time talking to computer pioneer John Von Neumann.  "In my view Booth did two key things," said Dr Roger Johnson, a computer scientist turned computer conservationist, "One is the multiplier, the other is that he was the first person to connect a rotating storage device successfully to a computer and read and write data."  In fact, he said, Dr Booth got perilously close to creating the first floppy disk. Unfortunately the disks he tried to adapt for his fledgling computer, paper coated with magnetic oxide used in an early dictating machine, proved too floppy. They deformed at the 3000 RPM he needed to spin them - making it impossible to read and write data to them.  Instead, said Dr Johnson, he invented magnetic drum storage that used a small brass drum coated with nickel. It was a world first and the original is now on display in the UK's Science Museum.  Both these innovations found a place in the small computers Booth built - the most significant of which was the All Purpose Electronic Computer (APEC).  The first version of APEC was built in a barn at the Booth family home in Fenny Compton, Warwickshire.  Raymond "Dickie" Bird has clear memories of the place, the man and the machine.  "The barn was falling to bits," Dr Bird told the BBC. "It was so rotten that the legs of the chairs we sat on sank in to the woodworm-eaten floor and it was as cold as hell."  Mr Bird and two colleagues were in Fenny Compton to copy the design of the APEC for the British Tabulating Machine Company which was keen to produce a computer of its own.  BTM was a market leader in punch card machines but, said Dr Bird, also had a prescient eye on the future.  "They saw the threat early on to their vast market for punch card machines that computers posed," he said. As a result it was in the market for a computer of its own and Dr Booth's fit the bill because it was small, relatively cheap, fit for business use and could be manufactured in large numbers.  By contrast, said Dr Bird, the other machines being produced in the early 1950s were usually too big, expensive and specialised for most of BTM's customers.  Not so with Dr Booth's machine.  "He wanted a tabulator to use as input and output to the machine he had got and in return he would give out the plans for the computer," he said.  The penny-pinching philosophy of Booth senior had rubbed off on his son, said Dr Bird, and was reflected in the APEC's design. Though, said Dr Bird, to be fair this approach was borne out of necessity as much as habit.  "Andrew Booth was a very economical man," said Dr Bird. "If something could be done with half a valve rather than one, he did it."  "He worked with no support from anyone else and designed computers, little ones, to work in his lab," he said.  "I took his basic circuits and the core of his logic and built a machine called HEC 1," said Dr Bird. "I engineered it to be manufacturable and serviceable."  "It was a reliable, low cost machine that could go by the hundreds into business," said Dr Bird. "And it did for we sold more than 100 of the Booth-derived machines."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35939409	Port Talbot: Javid tells workers plant has a future	Business Secretary Sajid Javid has told workers there is a future for steel production at Port Talbot, insisting the government is on "their side".  Hundreds of Tata Steel workers gathered to demand answers from Mr Javid as he left a meeting at the plant.  Holding a "Save our Steel" banner, workers asked him: "So you're not going to let us go to the wall?"  He said he would be "fully involved" in talks over a possible sale and there were "viable buyers" out there.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  Call to 'take over' Tata's pension fund  What next for Tata Steel workers?  Steel v banks - Why they're different when it comes to a government bail-out  The business secretary also defended his handling of the crisis and rejected claims the UK had been too easy on China over steel dumping.  Labour said ministers seemed "unaware" of the severity of the crisis.  Mr Javid has been under fire for being in Australia at the time that Tata announced its intention on Tuesday to sell Port Talbot and its other UK assets, putting at least 15,500 jobs at risk.  The minister, who returned on Friday morning, said he had "rushed back" amid concerns that there might only be weeks to safeguard the plant's future but had since been reassured by Tata that more time would be allowed to find a buyer.  Asked by workers if he would do everything he could to save their livelihoods, he did not give a firm guarantee but said: "We are on your side...There is time there."  Mr Javid said steel was "absolutely vital" to the UK's future industrial strategy, insisting that ministers had been in talks with Tata about the future "for a long time".  A crowd of workers chanted "save our steel" as Mr Javid was driven away from the site. He later tweeted that he was "honoured to meet some of the hardest working men and women in Britain".  The government is facing claims that it has blocked an EU measure which would have tackled the "dumping" of cheap Chinese steel in Europe - one of main handicaps facing UK producers.  Ministers opposed an European Commission proposal to lift the "lesser duty rule" cap, which would allow tougher tariffs to be imposed on cheap imported steel, arguing higher tariffs would hit other sectors such as the car industry.  But Mr Javid said this could "not be further from the truth", telling workers that the UK had "been the leader in getting tariffs imposed where evidence exists" of unfair trade practices.  Tata Steel's UK business - which directly employs 15,000 workers and supports thousands of others - includes plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  After a board meeting at its headquarters in Mumbai on Wednesday, Tata confirmed plans to sell its loss-making UK plants. Unless a buyer can be found, thousands of jobs are at risk.  The Port Talbot plant - which employs 4,100 people - is said to be losing £1m a day.  The EU is imposing financial penalties on 16 categories of Chinese steel imports which they believe are being "dumped" on overseas markets - effectively being sold at a loss.  The rate of these duties varies but, controversially, they are more often than not lower than the actual amount by which the products are under-priced.  This is in, large part, down to the so-called "lesser duty" rule.  This rule, which derives from World Trade Organisation regulations, states that it is desirable, although not necessary, for tariffs to be applied at a level "adequate" to remove the financial harm caused to competitors but "at a level lower than the margin of dumping".  UK steel producers and unions argue the EU, by adhering to this rule, has effectively capped steel tariffs at 9% although the European Commission does not recognise this figure.  Both Mr Javid and Prime Minister David Cameron have said nationalisation is "not the answer" for British steelworks but union and opposition figures have criticised the government for failing to do enough to respond to the issue.  Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the trade union Community which represents many steelworkers in Port Talbot, says Mr Javid had been slow to react.  "He must have known there was a potential for there to be a closure announcement last week and he wasn't to be seen."  And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said public ownership may be the only answer to guarantee the industry's future if no buyer came forward.  "I would advocate some form of public intervention, if necessary full public ownership, the crucial thing is to preserve the steel industry in Britain as a basis for our economic growth," he said.  Charles De Lusignan, from the European Steel Association, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the UK had not done all it could and, indeed, had been instrumental in blocking a European Commission proposal from 2013 to remove restrictions on higher tariffs.  Steel production makes up 1% of Britain's manufacturing output and 0.1% of the country's economic output.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and tighter rules on procurement to make sure major British projects are obliged to buy British steel.

The app-based taxi booking service uses an algorithm to set the cost of trips, but the plaintiffs allege that Travis Kalanick used this to co-ordinate higher prices for New York drivers.  A complaint filed in December said this constituted a price-fixing conspiracy in violation of antitrust laws.  The suit was originally filed by Uber customer Spencer Meyer from Connecticut.  Mr Kalanick had filed a motion to have the lawsuit thrown out, but this has now been rejected by Jed Rakoff, a judge at the US District Court, Southern District of New York.  "We disagree with this ruling," said Uber in a statement. "These claims are unwarranted and have no basis in fact.  "In just five years since its founding, Uber has increased competition, lowered prices, and improved service."  Uber is facing another lawsuit brought in California by three drivers who argued they should be defined as employees of the company - not contractors. This would entitle them to tips and expenses claims.  In that case, the court is awaiting documents to be received by November prior to the trial.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35943062	Reddit kills snooping 'warrant canary'	Online community Reddit has dropped its "warrant canary" from its latest transparency report.  A warrant canary is a statement declaring that a website has not received any classified data requests from government or law enforcement.  It is named after the early-warning birds which were sent down mine shafts to alert workers of toxic gases.  Reddit's 2014 report stated it had not received any classified demands, but the 2015 update did not say this.  The FBI can issue national security letters to conduct online surveillance in the US without court approval, but requests often come with a gagging order, which prevents websites from publicly disclosing them.  To get around this, many websites state that they have not received any classified requests.  Once the disclaimer vanishes from the transparency report, visitors might assume a secret request has been made.  Reddit published its first transparency report in 2014.  When asked about the disappearance of the canary from the latest report, one Reddit administrator wrote: "I've been advised not to say anything one way or the other".  The site said it had received 98 requests for user information that it could disclose in 2015, almost double the amount it received in 2014.  It complied with 60% of the requests, two-thirds of which originated in the United States.	tech

Fans will be able to access club-branded apps to get news, social media content, highlights and betting.  However access to the wider internet would not be possible.  The Football League said "the majority" of clubs had signed up to participate in the deal.  A full list of confirmed participating clubs will be announced after 30 June.  In an online article, the Football League said the service would "deliver the complete digital match day experience to supporters".  The free wi-fi would come as a boon to fans who had been frustrated with overloaded mobile networks at half-time, according to Intechnology chief executive Peter Wilkinson.  Having to use 3G or 4G services could also be expensive, he added.  However, wi-fi at sports events does not always prove popular with fans.  In 2014, supporters at PSV Eindhoven in the Netherlands protested against the introduction of wi-fi at their club's stadium, saying spectators should pay attention to what is happening on the pitch, not their smartphones.	tech

The button appeared beside Gmail's normal send button and allowed users to shut down an email thread by sending a gif of a Minion dropping a microphone.  However, a flurry of complaints about the button appeared on Google's forums.  The firm has since withdrawn the feature and apologised.  "It looks like we pranked ourselves this year," Google said in a statement.  "Due to a bug, the MicDrop feature inadvertently caused more headaches than laughs. We're truly sorry."  A mic drop is a popular meme in which someone makes a conclusive statement or rebuttal before dropping a microphone and walking off.  Google was not immediately able to clarify details of the bug.  Google added that users who were still able to see the feature could switch it off by reloading or restarting Gmail.  The button was not enabled on the Gmail accounts of enterprise business customers.  "Thanks to MicDrop I just lost my job," claimed one user on Google's product forums.  "I am a writer and had a deadline to meet. I sent my articles to my boss and never heard back from her. I inadvertently sent the email using the MicDrop send button."  Another complained that they had been having interviews for a job with a company for three months and then accidentally sent a mic drop email to the HR department.  And a third said that they had sent an "important email to 30 recipients".  Users had been informed of the button and what it would do via a message in Gmail when it first appeared.  Furthermore, users with the "undo send" capability enabled would have been able to retract a message within a certain time period after sending it.  Google has unveiled a couple of April Fool's joke videos, including one about a new delivery service and an "actual reality" headset.  Google originally announced the creation of Gmail on 1 April 2004 and, at the time, there was speculation as to whether the email service was an April Fool's stunt.	tech

The loss-making firm aims to have manufactured half a million vehicles by 2020, and believes the new automobile will make it possible to hit that target.  Earlier this year, the firm's chief Elon Musk told the BBC's Rory Cellan-Jones why Tesla had to make an "affordable" car.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35940302	Tesla Model 3 pitched as an 'affordable' electric car	Tesla has unveiled its much-anticipated Model 3 electric car - its lowest-cost vehicle to date.  The company's chief executive Elon Musk said it would start at $35,000 (£24,423) and have a range of at least 215 miles (346km) per charge.  He added that the base model would would accelerate from zero to 60mph (97km/h) in less than six seconds.  The California-based company needs the vehicle to prove popular if it is to stay in business.  Production and deliveries of the vehicle are scheduled to start in late 2017.  Most of those were its Model S saloon, which overtook Nissan's Leaf to become the world's bestselling pure-electric vehicle.  But the firm still posted a net loss of $889m (£620m) for 2015, partly because it spent $718m on research and development over the period.  It left Tesla with cash reserves of $1.2bn, down from $1.9bn a year earlier.  "For a long time there had been questions about the long term viability of Tesla," commented Jessica Caldwell, an industry analyst at the car research site Edmunds.  "With niche products like the Model S and the Model X, it hasn't been hitting any sales targets that would sustain its business.  "So, launching what it hopes will be high-volume vehicle is going to show if it can become a fully-fledged auto company that will succeed in the long-term rather than one that pumps out a few cool cars and then goes bust, as we've seen happen with other electric car start-ups such as Fisker."  In scenes more commonly associated with smartphone launches than those of vehicles, hundreds of people queued outside Tesla stores in the US to try to secure one of the first Model 3s.  They had to pay a $1,000 deposit to reserve the car before they had even seen it. The company also began taking online orders an hour before its press event had begun.  Mr Musk said more than 115,000 had been ordered already.  Part of the incentive to commit early is that a $7,500 tax credit offered to US buyers is set to be pulled once the company has sold 200,000 vehicles in the country.  "If you look at the US auto market, the average purchase price is about $33,000, which is close to what the target for the Model 3 is," said Ms Caldwell.  "So, it becomes less of that pie-in-the-sky dream car and something that the average person can actually afford.  "That's why people are excited about it in non-traditional Tesla markets - places outside of San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles - and why we saw lines in places like Houston and Arizona."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35909117	1966: Owen and Heseltine go to Westminster	I'm never happier than when rummaging around in the BBC archives.  Most of it these days is on computer. In 1990, when I joined as a trainee in Bristol, regional television had only stopped using film the year before.  With the help of our two great librarians at the time, among the hundreds of film cans, I discovered two programmes produced to mark a major event which took place 50 years ago this week, the general election held on 31 March 1966.  "Seven for Westminster" and "Seven at Westminster" were broadcast a few months apart to viewers living in the west country and on the south coast.  They did something which is common now but was quite unusual back then: identifying newly elected MPs and following them as they adjusted to their new life. Each was broadcast only once, and has never been seen since.  Among the seven captured at the start of their parliamentary careers are David Owen, later Foreign Secretary and one of the defectors from Labour who founded the SDP; and the future deputy prime minister Michael Heseltine, who helped to bring down Margaret Thatcher.  Armed with the archive of their younger selves I spoke to both of them.  Film of the 27-year-old new MP with his parents in their garden brought back memories for Lord Owen of his father's unintended contribution to his career.  David Owen secured the Labour nomination at a party meeting where, he says, Betty Boothroyd - later Speaker of the House of Commons - "made by far the best speech".  A clutch of women members, though, reassured Owen they had voted for him anyway because they were patients of Dr Owen senior.  Still, he maintains he wasn't expecting to become an MP in 1966; it was only when, after a prime ministerial visit a week before polling day, an aide of Harold Wilson waved goodbye and said "see you in Westminster" as the train pulled out of Plymouth Station, that he realised his medical career was about to be interrupted.  He says he only stopped looking at job adverts in the British Medical Journal after the 1979 election, when he finally accepted he wouldn't be going back.  The second film includes pictures of David Owen posing on the steps of the Ministry of Defence with his new boss, a junior defence minister.  When I asked Lord Owen about his rapid promotion, he told me it happened within days of his election; and the reason that he was chosen may have had something to do with the good dinner the minister received when he visited the constituency; apparently David Owen's father had been very generous with the Plymouth Gin.  Whatever the explanation, Owen's appointment as a Parliamentary Private Secretary gave him the ear of ministers in a department whose decisions directly affected his constituents, many of whom worked in the dockyard at Devonport.  "I can speak to anyone from the Prime Minister down," he told the interviewer in 1966.  As for the restriction of party discipline - something he would strain against as Labour lurched leftwards after its election defeat in 1979 - the young Owen seems to have regarded it as part of the job.  "I've got to accept the discipline of the group. This is politics; if you don't like compromise, don't become a politician".  In the light of his later defection to the SDP, I asked Lord Owen whether his view had changed.  "No, I can honestly say not," he told me. He said his loyalty was to Labour values even as the party itself veered away from them.  "I continued to represent the Labour cause until 1992 [the year he retired from the House of Commons] … social democrat was compatible with being Labour."  That will probably irritate quite a lot of members of the Labour Party who shared his outlook in 1981, but stuck with the party rather than join the SDP.  "Do you still feel Labour?" I asked.  "'Nearly' is the real human answer to that," he replied.  Michael Heseltine never changed parties, but even in his earliest days as an MP there were signs of the independent streak that, for a while, would derail his political career.  The new Member for Tavistock told the narrator of "Seven for Westminster" he was worried about "the sinister risk of compromise", of doing as the party wants rather than sticking to his own view.  It's hard not to see these remarks through the prism of Lord Heseltine's cabinet resignation 20 years later, his leadership challenge to Mrs Thatcher, and, of course, the pro-European Union views, which on occasion left him looking isolated.  "I'd forgotten it, but strongly subscribe to it", he says today. "I was not going to be a 'yes man'".  Despite their party differences, David Owen and Michael Heseltine had things in common; trying to maintain careers in London (one in medicine, the other in publishing), make their mark in Parliament and nurse constituencies hundreds of miles away.  Lord Heseltine recalls journeys in a Morris or Austin car, crammed with his wife, three children, a cat and a bird in a cage.  It took ten hours to travel from London to Tavistock, his constituency on Dartmoor - "and the cat was sick".  In the films, Heseltine, complete with trademark shoulder length hair, exudes confidence, speaking directly to the camera rather than the interviewer. Today, he admits that he didn't always feel in control.  In one film, he is standing in a milking parlour, immaculate in a three piece suit, hands clasped behind his back, earnestly attentive as the farmer explains about the risk of brucellosis.  "I look", he says now "like a man from Mars".  He says fitting in was important for a new MP, especially one who, as the narrator in 1966 drily observed, "is not a countryman".  There is no doubt that the 32-year-old publishing boss did try to make an impression on his rural constituents - perhaps too hard.  "Seven at Westminster" includes a glorious sequence of the young MP towing a caravan into a village with "Heseltine" emblazoned on its side.  This was his mobile constituency surgery, an attempt to reach voters who would not otherwise be able to bring their problems to him.  Half a century later, Lord Heseltine describes it as a "terrible, terrible mistake".  People had turned out enthusiastically on his first visit, Lord Heseltine says, but by the third or fourth they had completely lost interest.  Worse, he was stuck with it because he feared if he stopped the village visits, people would say "he's lost interest, he doesn't care, we never see him".  Only when his seat was abolished in 1974 and he moved to Oxfordshire did he stop.  "I didn't take the idea to Henley", he deadpans.  In the two films from 1966, images of how elections used to be fought - the daytime declarations from town hall balconies, for example, because few were daft enough to declare results in the middle of the night - contrast with reminders of how little has changed.  Dr Owen - "rather serious but one of Labour's rising stars", as he is described in one of the films - describes a feeling that would sound familiar to any MP today.  "Overnight", he complained in 1966, "I went from being respected as a doctor to being regarded with cynical denigration".  Today, his view is somewhat different.  "A very large number of people thought I'd gone down in the world and that upset me in a way. This is a very healthy thing in a democracy".	politics

The PM said nationalisation was "not the right answer" after Tata Steel's decision to sell its UK business.  Unions and opposition parties say the government is in "chaos", and want action to save the threatened plants.  Business secretary Sajid Javid has been under pressure as he returns from an official trip to Australia.  Tata Steel's UK business - which directly employs 15,000 workers and supports thousands of others - includes plants in Port Talbot, Rotherham, Corby and Shotton.  The Port Talbot plant - which employs 4,100 people - is said to be losing £1m a day.  Tata Steel UK: What are the options?  What next for Tata Steel workers?  Speaking after chairing an emergency meeting at Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the situation at Port Talbot was of "deep concern" and said the steel jobs were "vital" to workers' families and the communities.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said a "more nuanced" solution was needed in recognition of the global oversupply of steel.  "We can't simply ignore that - just continuing to produce steel for which there is not adequate demand isn't the answer," he added.  For all the bold talk, privately ministers are deeply apprehensive about saving the steel industry.  Why? Well, all the options look difficult.  Finding a buyer would be the preferred solution. But with Port Talbot losing £1m a day who would want to take it over?  A worker-management buyout is possible but their turnaround plan would require £300m of investment.  Port Talbot could be "mothballed" to secure more time to find a buyer but that would still mean laying off all but a handful of employees.  And taxpayer support - short of nationalisation - would almost certainly fall foul of EU state aid rules.  But there is perhaps an even more pressing reason ministers are sounding increasingly cautious.  They simply don't know what Tata is up to.  Despite repeated requests ministers have been unable to secure a promise that the steel plants will not be closed within a few weeks.  Ministers insist they will need months to put a rescue plan in place.  Privately some in government fear the reason Tata won't say is because they are not interested in finding a buyer.  Why, they ask, would Tata want to sell their steel plants to a competitor?  In other words, Tata may already have determined the fate of the British steel industry and those who work in it - whatever option the government eventually decides to pursue.  The PM defended the government's handling of the crisis, saying ministers had been working "for months" to save the industry and said the government had taken action on energy costs.  Mr Javid, who cut short a business visit to Australia to return to the UK, has come in for particular criticism for his absence during the crisis - and for taking his daughter with him on the trip.  Labour MP Anna Turley said it gave the impression of the trip "being a jolly", while Stephen Kinnock, whose Aberavon constituency is home to the Port Talbot plant, said Mr Javid should have travelled to Mumbai for Tata's crunch board meeting on Tuesday "but instead he chose to jet off to Australia".  A source from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said Mr Javid's daughter "was there to spend time with her father" and "he paid for everything" - and dismissed Mr Kinnock's calls for him to consider his position as "ridiculous".  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the UK was in the grip of an "industrial crisis of enormous proportions".  He called for the creation of a steel taskforce and for the government to intervene to save the steel industry like it did the banks during the financial crisis, saying EU state aid rules had not prevented Italy or France from "protecting" their steel industries.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government "should nationalise to stabilise" saying this would involve covering the plant's costs in the short term to help a new buyer turn it around.  Mr McDonnell said the government should "bring forward the support that was expected in this budget and didn't happen" about reducing business rates, which he said were "five to seven times" higher in the UK than Europe.  After days of uncertainty, there are still very few answers for the workers of Port Talbot.  They want to know how long they've got. They want to know if they can pay the mortgage, plan for the future and depend on a pension. But at the moment, nobody can tell them.  There is anger here over how the UK government has handled the situation.  While a delegation of local union reps were able to find a way to Mumbai to lobby Tata, there were no government ministers to be seen there. Likewise, no UK minister has made their way to Port Talbot yet.  Even if, as David Cameron says, there has been work behind the scenes for months, many workers here would like evidence of something more solid.  One worker told me he thinks the government has walked into this "with its eyes wide shut". There have been clouds gathering over this plant for months - but yet when the storm hit there was no protection on offer.  There is still hope here that a buyer can be found - in Port Talbot more than anywhere, they believe fervently in the product and prospect of demand for steel rising in years ahead.  But as the deadline to find a buyer seems to be in weeks rather than years, there is a grudging acceptance that time is against them.  Steel production makes up 1% of Britain's manufacturing output and 0.1% of the country's economic output.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and much tighter rules on procurement to ensure major British projects are obliged to buy British steel.  But it has also been accused of opposing EU moves to impose higher tariffs on Chinese steel entering Europe.  China "dumping" cheap steel on overseas markets is being partly blamed for the problems facing the UK steel industry.  Mr Kinnock called for an immediate injection of government money to ensure the Port Talbot plant keeps going while its future lies in the balance.  A number of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs have said the government should not rule out subsidising the industry. This would be in contravention of EU rules restricting so-called state aid.  But venture capitalist Jon Moulton, who tried to rescue MG Cars when it was put up for sale by BMW, told Today saving the plants was "probably mission impossible" as a "very, very large amount of money would need to go in to come up with any chance of a way forward".  There are also warnings that the end of steel production in Port Talbot would severely undermine Britain's defence capability and its status as a leading military power.

Launching his party's campaign in Sheffield, he said there would be no "decent, meaningful opposition" unless the Lib Dems regained ground.  And he called for a return to his party's "community politics" tradition.  Elections take place across the UK on May 5.  As well as the local authority elections in England, polls are also being held for the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations as well as to elect a London mayor and police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.  They represent a first major electoral test for Mr Farron, who replaced Nick Clegg as Liberal Democrat leader last year.  The Lib Dems sustained heavy losses in council elections during the coalition government and were left with just eight MPs after last year's general election.  But Mr Farron said his party was "determined" to recover ground.  "Every election starts nil-nil," he said.  "If you assume you're going to be beaten, you deserve to be beaten."  He said the party's campaign would focus on "defending local services", housing, and "a shared belief in community politics".  He added: "We know we can make a difference in people's lives, and we will never give up fighting for our communities."	politics

The Wall Street Journal said that a number of US companies had had their computer systems compromised.  The FBI would not confirm whether or not an insider trading investigation was under way.  Earlier in the year, security company Flashpoint had warned some firms that hackers were targeting legal offices.  A spokeswoman for Flashpoint was not able to comment in detail on the alert sent to law firms, but told the BBC: "All the details surrounding any activity have been turned over to the authorities and they are handling the situation from there."  Law firm Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP confirmed to the BBC that it suffered a "limited breach" last summer.  "We are not aware that any of the information that may have been accessed has been used improperly," the statement said.  The rising threat of hacking has been noticed by many in the legal industry.  Recently, attempts to compromise the security of law firms' computer networks have been detected by clients of London law office CMS, which brokers cybersecurity insurance policies for a range of companies.  "We've seen examples of emails [at client law firms] that purport to come from a managing partner to a more junior lawyer directing them to make payments to an account or to send certain information to an address," Stephen Tester, a partner at CMS, told the BBC.  "They can look very much like a regular message."  Law firms had even reported breaches of their video-conferencing systems, commented Mr Tester.  "There are ways in which people can go into video-based conferencing facilities and literally listen in on meetings," he said.  He added that while the issue was a growing concern for all businesses, he felt law companies were in a special position because of the sensitivity of the data they held.  Last year, a ring of alleged insider trading hackers was apprehended after they were accused of netting more than $100m (£70m) in illegal profits.  The group was accused of stealing sensitive financial information from wire news services before it had been published.	tech

The test looked at how quickly files could be downloaded and how smoothly online video could be streamed.  EE was put under the spotlight along with O2, Three and Vodafone.  The coverage was tested in Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London and Norwich where high-speed 4G networks have already been rolled out.  For the first time, Ofcom also measured network performance while walking and driving to reflect real-world usage.  Virtual mobile operators that piggyback on the major networks' infrastructure were not included in the test, which took place in November and December 2015.  Ofcom found that EE's 4G network averaged speeds of 20 megabits per second (Mbps) - capable of downloading a 10MB file such as a very high-resolution photo in four seconds.  O2 averaged speeds of 10Mbps - in theory taking twice as long to download the same file.  The study found that O2 was consistently outperformed by its competitors, with the company saying that maintenance work on its network may have affected the results.  O2 said the report highlighted "some good performance for O2's network".  "The survey was carried out over a limited period of time and Ofcom acknowledges that the findings are not representative of the overall UK performance for all operators," the company said in a statement.  "Maintenance work, which would include our network modernisation programme, may have affected results.  "Ofcom's recent report on customer complaints shows that O2 continues to perform well, with a low number of complaints made to the regulator."	tech

Police in Arkansas wish to unlock an iPhone and iPod belonging to two teenagers accused of killing a couple, according to the Associated Press (AP).  Less than a day after its San Bernardino announcement, the FBI agreed to help in the homicide case.  Syed Farook and his wife were shot dead after killing 14 people in December.  A judge agreed to postpone the Arkansas case on 28 March to allow prosecutors to ask the FBI for help.  Hunter Drexler, 18, and Justin Staton, 15, are accused of killing Robert and Patricia Cogdell at their home in Conway, Arkansas last July.  Staton had been raised as a grandson by the Cogdells.  "We always appreciate [the FBI's] cooperation and willingness to help their local law enforcement partners," Faulkner County prosecuting attorney Cody Hilland told the AP.  An attorney for Mr Drexler told the AP she was "not concerned" about any data on the phone.  Previously, the FBI had asked Apple to write new software that would allow it to gain access to Farook's iPhone.  However, the company refused, arguing it would be wrong to compromise the security of one of its devices since that might lead to vulnerabilities in many other iPhones.	tech

In return, the US will send a different type of used uranium to Europe where it will be used to help diagnose cancer.  The BBC's James Landale said the PM's aim was to show that it is possible to think differently about how to dispose of nuclear waste.  But Friends of the Earth said any transatlantic transportation of nuclear waste was a risk it advised against.  Mr Cameron will travel to the US later to announce the agreement at a summit on civil nuclear security in Washington.  He will tell world leaders that Britain will transport 700kg of highly enriched uranium to the US from the Dounreay storage facility in Scotland.  Officials said this would be the largest ever such movement of nuclear waste, which the US has more capacity to store and process.  In return, a different form of used uranium will be transported from America to the European Atomic Energy agency (Euratom) where it will be turned into radio isotopes that are used to detect and diagnose cancer.  Richard Dixon, director of Friends of the Earth Scotland, said: "Only the nuclear industry could think it was a good idea to risk swapping large quantities of one of the most dangerous materials on the planet across the Atlantic.  "Europe is littered with plenty of highly radioactive waste from both reactors and weapons - there cannot possibly be a need to be importing any more from the US, or for us to be sending ours to them.  "Nuclear waste should be dealt with as close to where it is produced as possible rather than risking transporting it in ships or planes. The consequences of an accident during transit would be horrific."  At the fourth Nuclear Security summit, to be chaired by US President Barack Obama, Mr Cameron will also announce Britain and the US are to hold a joint exercise to test both countries' ability to prevent cyber attacks on their nuclear stations and waste facilities.  The prime minister will offer British expertise to countries including Japan, Turkey, South Korea and Argentina which have asked for advice on how best to protect their nuclear plants.  And he will commit £10m to be spent on civil nuclear security worldwide.  During the biennial summit, first held in 2010, heads of government will also consider their response to the nightmare scenario of terrorists creating and using a dirty bomb.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35931342	General election polls in 2015 'the most inaccurate'	Opinion polls before the 2015 election were among the most inaccurate since surveying began more than 70 years ago, an industry-wide review has suggested.  The British Polling Council research followed the widespread failure to predict last May's majority Tory win.  Surveys did not accurately sample the UK population, and over-represented Labour voters, it says.  The BPC has recommended a series of changes, saying pollsters may wish to randomly select participants in future.  It says "probability sampling" may be a more accurate way of gauging voters' intentions than the current practice of recruiting people in advance to take part on the basis of their likely voting habits.  The majority of polls taken during the five-week general election campaign indicated the Conservatives and Labour, led by David Cameron and Ed Miliband respectively, were neck-and-neck.  This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern.  However the Conservatives secured an overall majority for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their 6.5% margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise.  The BPC, which represents the major survey bodies and issued an interim report into its findings in January, says the Tory win was not foreseen due to "systemic" errors.  Its inquiry said unrepresentative sampling was the primary cause for the polling failures.  It cited the over-representation of Labour voters and under-representation of Tories, with Conservative voters apparently being harder to reach.  There was, it added, an over-reliance on more willing survey respondents and said that too few elderly people being polled could have also played a part.  It also said an inaccurate expectation of a hung parliament may have influenced the result of the election itself.  The report makes 12 recommendations to the way polls are conducted in future.  These include a call for measures to be taken to make sure samples are more representative, and a review into the way in which "don't know" voters are allocated in the results.  It says BPC members should state clearly which variables were used to weight data and detail the adjustments made in between polls.  BPC president John Curtice said the organisation will look to implement the report's recommendations on transparency but cannot compel members to comply with following a specific type of methodology.  But he said the BPC will issue a report ahead of the general election in 2020 detailing how companies have changed their sampling and weighting procedures.  "The BPC recognises that simply saying 'well okay, it's all fine, everybody go off and do their own thing' may not be thought of as an adequate response to what happened in 2015," Prof Curtice said.  Southampton University professor of research methodology Patrick Sturgis, who chaired the research for the BPC, said the report should not be used to "bash the polls".  He said "we still think that the polls are really the only show in town for forecasting election results".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35696521	Will tomorrow's smart office be a saviour or a spy?	Over the next six weeks the BBC will examine how our built environment is changing. Tomorrow's Buildings will look at how technology is making our offices smarter, our homes more affordable and even transforming building sites.  Ask someone what they dislike about working in an office and the list will probably be long.  It is likely to include: workload, the boss, colleagues, uncomfortable chairs, lack of light, no decent food in the canteen and Arctic air-conditioning.  Technology may soon be able to ease the last of these, offering a better working environment by allowing workers to control their heating via a smartphone app.  But does that come at a price? Do the sensors that are increasingly making the office environment smarter also mean that workers are under constant surveillance?  Welcome to the brave new world of the smart office.  Research firm Gartner predicts that commercial buildings will have more than 500 million "connected things" during 2016.  The biggest driver for this is to improve energy efficiency - currently commercial buildings account for 40% of the world's electricity consumption.  By embedding hundreds of sensors in walls, ceilings or even lights, the systems that keep the office running smoothly can be connected and in turn these building management systems (BMS) can be connected to the corporate network and the internet.  At Deloitte's headquarters in Amsterdam, workers can control the lights, heating and blinds via an app, while in London building consultant Arup is experimenting with smart desks - embedding sensors in them and hooking them up to smartphone apps to allow people to control lighting and heating.  "A staggering amount of energy is wasted on heating empty offices, homes and partially occupied buildings," said Carlo Ratti, who heads up the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Senseable Cities lab.  His team is working on a project that measures the number of people in a building and adjusts heating and lighting accordingly - with a view to turning an empty building "off", just like a computer goes into standby mode when not in use.  He is also working on localised heating and cooling systems, which can provide a precise, personal climate for each occupant using "an array of responsive infrared heating elements that are guided by sophisticated motion tracking".  "Individual thermal 'clouds' follow people through space, ensuring ubiquitous comfort while improving overall energy efficiency," he explained.  That will appeal to anyone who has complained about the air conditioning and comes amid mounting evidence that people do require different temperatures - women, for instance, feel comfortable in heat that is several degrees higher than the ambient temperature preferred by men, according to a study from Dutch scientists last year.  Smarter lighting or heating is all well and good when it works but, like most technology, it isn't always fit for purpose.  Doug King, a member of the Royal Academy of Engineering and expert on smart buildings, told the BBC: "There are lots of apocryphal stories about lighting systems being over-ridden by cleaners who don't want to clean in the dark or tales that, if one person is working late, the lights remain on in large parts of the buildings.  "People will do what they have to do to get their jobs done in the level of comfort they need and that may mean hacking the building. They may shut off the systems by sticking Sellotape over the sensors or the building maintenance staff may reset the controls because they simply become fed up with all the complaints."  Concerns about the smart lighting not working could pale into insignificance next to the wider question about what data all the hidden sensors around a building are collecting.  Architect Rem Koolhaas has spoken out against the way technology is infiltrating buildings, saying it is "totally astonishing" that people are willing to sacrifice their privacy for convenience and describing the rise of smart systems as "potentially sinister".  He told Dezeen magazine that the use of smart technologies represented the most radical shift in architectural practice for over a century - architects had become too distracted by the benefits and overlooked the dangers.  Most building data is currently collected anonymously but that doesn't mean it could not be used for other purposes.  "You could imagine using data from a building management system to find out when someone is in the office and when they are not," said Mr King.  British newspaper the Daily Telegraph did just that earlier this year, fitting under-desk sensors to measure occupancy with a view to using the data to make the office more energy-efficient.  Staff did not see it quite that way, reacting with anger - while the National Union of Journalists described it as "surveillance" and the trial was hastily withdrawn, just a day after it had been announced.  It illustrates the fact that smart buildings may mean very different things to different people.  On the one hand is the landlord, who wants to make savings on energy and other costs, and on the other are the people who live and work in those buildings and may not appreciate being monitored during their working day - even if it is done anonymously.  We need to make sure technology is serving the people who work in such buildings, thinks Arup's director of architecture Nille Juul-Sorensen.  "We have to start with the humans, putting people first and then the technology that can help them," he said.  And Mr King said there were ways of using data to help usher in a new era of smarter design.  "Ten years ago we were just guessing but now there is an awful lot more data about ways people are using buildings which can be fed back to improve the next ones," he said.  Increasingly, firms such as Deloitte and Arup are using technologies such as virtual reality to give potential clients an idea about how a building will look before they move in.  Ultimately, thinks Mr Juul-Sorensen, designers need to start asking even more radical questions about how we will work in future - is it, for instance, smart to even have an office at all in an era when the internet can connect people in different parts of the world?  "The way we work is very different from 20 years ago and yet we are still basing our design on the old days and then building in a lot of technology. We are designing for the past not the future," he said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35927651	Build 2016: Microsoft proposes helper bot boom	Microsoft has unveiled a new system of bots that can represent businesses and interact with users via Skype.  Social bots are automated programs that can chat to users in a humanlike way.  As part of the Build developer conference, Microsoft also revealed updates to digital assistant Cortana, which can interact with bots on the user's behalf.  Cortana will now function across various devices and operating systems, like Android and iOS.  The tech giant also announced a Skype app for its HoloLens headset.  "We want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences," Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella told the audience at Build in San Francisco.  Mr Nadella described Cortana as "a truly unbounded personal assistant that's always with you" as he explained that it would be available across Windows, iOS and Android devices.  Just hours earlier, however, an artificial intelligence Twitter bot called Tay created by Microsoft was briefly reactivated and began spewing nonsensical tweets.  Mr Nadella acknowledged problems with the bot and said, "we are back to the drawing board".  Lilian Rincon, Skype group program manager, proceeded to demonstrate how automated online bots could interact with Cortana during a text conversation in Skype.  "Right away what you're seeing here is that the agent, Cortana, is actually brokering the conversation with the third party bot," she explained, as Cortana finalised details of a product delivery.  The app could also, for example, listen in to a conversation between friends about a trip and then suggest introducing a bot representing a local hotel.  Booking could then be carried out as though a conversation were taking place between the user and a sales representative.  "Microsoft is integrating its Cortana and deep learning capabilities into a platform that will span everything from Skype to Outlook and across devices," analyst at CCS Insight Geoff Blaber told the BBC.  "This is Microsoft trying to establish the next platform, having missed mobile."  Chris Green, a tech expert at consultancy Lewis, said the developments are likely intended to increase the availability of Cortana to more users on more systems and so increase the app's "stickiness".  "That concept of stickiness is quite important, it's about forming that bond between user and system - it's critical to achieve long term usability," he told the BBC.  The firm also reiterated that its HoloLens augmented reality headset, which was unexpectedly announced at Build last year, would begin shipping to developers.  An announcement to this effect had already been made on Microsoft's Windows blog in February.  Applications showcasing how HoloLens could be used to, for example, teach students about human anatomy - with 'holographic' illustrations of organ systems visible in 3D to headset-wearers.  This time last year Satya Nadella was gearing up for a massive launch - Windows 10. For the first time, the operating system would be free. The goal - get it on as many devices as possible, because then the real fun can begin.  More than 270 million Windows 10 devices later, it's time to see what it can do. At Build 2016, the excitement is around AI and AR.  AI - artificial intelligence - has an only-slightly-joking reputation as being the tech that will potentially bring about the end of humanity as we know it. But it's not "man versus machine", Mr Nadella said, but "human with machine".  He said bots are the new apps, and to demonstrate, Microsoft's Cortana assistant is breaking out - it's being integrated into other programmes like Skype. The aim here is to have this omnipresent assistant that grows smarter over time.  AR - augmented reality - is now ready for developers. The first HoloLens headsets are being sent out, and with it the promise of computing experiences we've never before imagined, for education, enterprise and entertainment.  But it must be said, the on-screen demos of HoloLens are fantastical compared to what the device can actually do today.  As Windows 10 was being launched, people asked if Microsoft would be able to drag itself back into relevancy.  Today's show of AI and AR proves they've surpassed that.

Labour has called for MPs to return to Westminster to discuss the future of the Port Talbot steelworks after Tata Steel's decision to sell the plant.  Jeremy Corbyn told workers there they were "not expendable on the altar of a global corporation" and urged ministers to act now to protect the industry.  David Cameron will chair a meeting of senior colleagues on Thursday.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid is returning early from an official trip to Australia to lead the government's response although it is not clear whether he will attend Thursday's meeting.  Mr Javid, who arrived in Sydney on Tuesday for what was due to be a three-day trade visit, said it was vital steelmaking continued at Port Talbot but played down talk of the business and Tata Steel's other remaining UK assets being taken into public ownership, saying there were "buyers out there".  Ministers say they are considering "all options" for the Port Talbot plant after owners Tata Steel said it wants to sell it and the rest of its loss-making UK business.  The Welsh Assembly has been recalled to discuss the crisis, and will meet on Monday. Parliament is due to return on 11 April after the Easter recess.  Late on Tuesday, after a board meeting in Mumbai, Tata Group said it planned to sell the UK steel business, asking its European holding company to "explore all options for restructuring".  The decision also affects workers at its other UK plants, including Rotherham, Corby and Shotton. There has been no specific mention of these plants from the government.  Ministers are concerned Tata could seek to close the Port Talbot plant within weeks if a buyer is not found.  It is understood the government is looking at offering loan guarantees to potential buyers and much tighter rules on procurement to ensure major British projects are obliged to buy british steel.  During times when MPs are not sitting, the Speaker can, if asked by the government, decide to recall the House of Commons. Recent examples include:  Labour shadow business secretary Angela Eagle told BBC News the government should step in and buy the steel plant's strategic assets to ensure they are "kept for the nation" if no buyer can be found.  "The government should know that if this industry is left to die it will cost a lot more in the long run… It will devastate those communities," she added.  During his visit to Port Talbot, Mr Corbyn said the livelihoods of thousands of workers were at stake and called on the government to guarantee that steel made in Port Talbot was used in public procurement projects, such as the railways and construction.  He also called on the Chinese government to end its "disgraceful" dumping of cheap steel in European markets, saying the practice was against world trade regulations.  Mr Javid insisted that he had been in contact with Tata Group executives and believed a buyer could be found for its UK business, hinting that the UK would be willing to provide "commercial support" to facilitate a deal.  No 10, meanwhile, said its focus was on "finding a long-term sustainable future for steel making at Port Talbot and across the UK" and Parliament would not be recalled.  "Ministers will continue to hold briefings to update representatives of other parties... but we have no plans to recall Parliament," a Downing Street spokesman said.  There are a growing number of Conservative MPs saying the government should step in and intervene if a buyer could not be found.  Tom Pursglove - whose Corby constituency includes one of the Tata plants - said he was "one of the biggest free-market Conservatives you will find", but added: "I don't think we should rule anything out," saying the industry was of vital economic interest.  The MP said the UK needed to ensure it retained a steel industry for self defence, so in any future war the UK could manufacture its own armaments.  If Britain were to leave the EU it would certainly have greater freedom to impose anti-dumping tariffs. But Britain's steel industry is closely tied to the EU - exporting some three million tonnes of steel products last year.  Outside the EU, the British steel industry could itself face punishing tariffs, depending on what sort of deal could be negotiated.  It is worth noting that many of the measures the steel industry is seeking could be implemented by the British government: lower business rates, a relaxation of carbon emissions targets for heavy manufacturers, more compensation for high energy prices, and a commitment that British steel is used in major construction projects.  But the future of British steel has already become another important issue in the debate over whether we would be better off in or out of the European Union.  David TC Davis, chairman of the Commons Welsh Affairs Select Committee and a former British Steel worker, said he "wasn't against the idea at all".  "We do need to have a viable steel industry in this country, it's very important from a defence point of view. I'm perfectly open-minded about that but it's got to be profitable in some way," he told Radio 4's World at One.  The European Commission said the UK government had not been in contact regarding the possibility of state intervention.  Cheap steel imports from other countries, such as China, have been partly to blame for the crisis. Tata Steel has also cited the high manufacturing costs in the UK.  Tata announced more than 1,000 job cuts, including 750 in Port Talbot, in January. Last October, it said nearly 1,200 jobs would go at plants in Scunthorpe and Lanarkshire.	politics

Brian Bates used a drone to film Amanda Zolicoffer during a liaison with a man last August.  Mr Bates says this was the only occasion on which he has used a drone to film such an encounter.  A civil liberties campaigner pointed out that filming with drones could raise privacy concerns.  According to court documents seen by the BBC, Zolicoffer was sentenced to a year in state prison for the misdemeanour.  The case against her alleged client, who was released following arrest in December, is still pending.  Footage of an encounter between two individuals in a parked vehicle was given to Oklahoma City police by Mr Bates.  "I'm sort of known in the Oklahoma City area," Mr Bates told the BBC.  "For the last 20 years I've used a video camera to document street-level and forced prostitution, and human trafficking."  Mr Bates added that on this occasion he felt safer filming the incident via drone and said that it was able to get "very good footage".  Mr Bates runs a website where he publishes videos of alleged sex workers and their clients.  "I am openly referred to as a video vigilante, I don't really shy away from that," he said.  However, Mr Bates also said that he was reluctant to use his drone in many cases because of safety concerns.  In this instance, said Mr Bates, the two individuals were inside a vehicle and the incident occurred away from other members of the public.  "I'd certainly caution other people who may be tempted to use drones to maybe fight drug activity or prostitution or gangs in their neighbourhood," he said.  "If one thing goes wrong, you will probably be the person facing criminal charges or civil liability."  "People operating drones have to think about whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy when they are filming," said Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group.  "Filming in public spaces [for example] is very different from filming someone's private property."  Mr Killock pointed out some general issues facing drone owners with regards to filming and said there was little difference between this and traditional photography.  "The technologies may be different but the ethics are fundamentally the same."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35927542	UK steel industry and the EU debate	Conservative MP Tom Pursglove is delivering a letter to the prime minister this afternoon calling on the government to ignore EU rules on state aid and consider nationalising the steel industry.  As a prominent campaigner for Britain to leave the EU, it is no surprise that he believes Britain would be in a better position to protect the steel industry if we were not bound by EU rules.  Those on the other side of the referendum debate point out that the EU is our most important market for steel, with more than half of our steel exports going to the EU and more than two thirds of our imports coming from it.  The EU Commissioner in charge of competition policy Margrethe Vestager summed up the rules earlier this year.  She said: "EU countries and the Commission have put in place strict safeguards against state aid to rescue and restructure steel companies in difficulty.  "This avoids harmful subsidy races between EU countries and that uncontrolled state aid in one EU country can unfairly put at risk thousands of jobs across the EU", adding: "EU state aid rules enable member states to for example support research activities or relieve energy costs of steel companies".  Whilst it is technically true that outside the EU the UK government would be free to nationalise and subsidise the steel industry, it seems highly unlikely that a Conservative government would want to permanently re-nationalise such a loss-making business.  Out campaigners and steel industry representatives agree that EU anti-dumping measures are inadequate to prevent the Chinese dumping low-cost steel into the market.  The Lesser Duty rule caps tariffs at 9%. UK Steel, the trade association for the steel industry, says this has little effect when heavily-subsidised Chinese steel is sold at 66% of cost price. Ministers have argued against lifting the cap, saying higher tariffs would hit other sectors such as the car industry.  UK Steel does not accept the government's argument on this, pointing out that other EU countries such as France and Germany, which both have important car manufacturers, are in favour of lifting it.  If Britain were to leave the EU it would certainly have greater freedom to impose anti-dumping tariffs. But Britain's steel industry is closely tied to the EU - exporting some three million tonnes of steel products last year.  Outside the EU, the British steel industry could itself face punishing tariffs, depending on what sort of deal could be negotiated.  It is worth noting that many of the measures the steel industry is seeking could be implemented by the British government: lower business rates, a relaxation of carbon emissions targets for heavy manufacturers, more compensation for high energy prices, and a commitment that British steel is used in major construction projects.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35925139	Nest chief Tony Fadell attacked by Dropcam's founder	The chief of Nest - the internet-connected home tech specialist - has been attacked in a blog by the founder of Dropcam, the video camera start-up it acquired less than two years ago.  Greg Duffy accused Tony Fadell of "insulting" Dropcam employees who had joined Nest as part of the takeover.  He also suggested Mr Fadell had "fetishised" some of the worst traits of Apple's Steve Jobs.  Neither Nest nor its owner Alphabet - Google's parent - have responded.  But in an interview published by the Information news site last week, Mr Fadell was quoted as saying: "A lot of [Dropcam's] employees were not as good as we hoped. It was a very small team and unfortunately it wasn't a very experienced team."  The article said Nest later clarified that this only referred to Dropcam employees who had left the business following the merger.  Mr Duffy is among their number.  "American corporates are usually surprisingly discreet and manage to keep grief hidden behind their walls," commented Matthew Gwyther, editor of Management Today.  "You've obviously got an enormous personality ego clash between the two men.  "But I bet this kind of thing is far more common than we normally hear."  Mr Duffy said he posted his thoughts to Medium's site to "set the record straight".  "The 50 Dropcam employees who resigned did so because they felt their ability to build great products being totally crushed," he said.  "All of us have worked at big companies before, where it is harder to move fast. But this is something different, as evidenced by the continued lack of output from the currently 1,200-person team and its virtually unlimited budget.  "According to LinkedIn, total attrition to date at Nest amounts to nearly 500 people, which suggests that we were not alone in our frustrations."  He also challenged Mr Fadell to publish Nest's accounts to reveal how well its internet cameras were faring compared to its smart thermostats and net-connected smoke alarms.  "The current leadership of Nest... seems to be fetishising only the most superfluous and negative traits of their mentors. For the sake of the customers and for the talented employees that remain there, I hope they find a way through these struggles."  This appears to be a reference to Mr Fadell's time working alongside Apple's late chief executive Steve Jobs. The two - along with others - developed first the iPod and then the iPhone.  "I've built a lot of my success off finding these truly gifted people and not settling for B and C players, but really going for the A players," Mr Jobs said in an interview.  Apple's co-founder famously added that settling for B players risked creating a "bozo explosion... that kind of company never ever succeeds".  According to the Information, Mr Fadell and Mr Duffy repeatedly clashed in the brief time they worked together.  Mr Fadell recalls telling Mr Duffy he had not "earned" the right to report directly to him.  In turn, Mr Duffy says he told Nest's co-founder that he was running the division like "a tyrant bureaucrat".  It is also reported that Mr Duffy tried and failed to convince Alphabet's chief executive Larry Page to sack Mr Fadell and let him take charge.  Mr Duffy says he now thinks it was a "mistake" to have sold his firm to Nest for $555m (£385m).  "Larry Page is said to be a friend of Fadell, but he would do very well to stay completely out of it," remarked Mr Gwyther.  "It looks terrible to appear to be taking sides against people in your organisation.  "But the wider affair is a reflection of the incredibly high expectations that there are of these tech companies - that you think stuff will happen very quickly and work pretty fast.  "But it's a reminder that it's not always straightforward, and there can be stumbles along the way when trying to create new products."	tech

The update to a list of prohibited listings now includes "any USB-C (or USB Type-C) cable or adapter product that is not compliant with standard specifications".  Some USB-C cables can damage devices or fail to charge them properly.  "Really great news, but we all have to continue to be vigilant and call out any bad products we find on Amazon and other stores (both online and brick and mortar) as we find them," wrote Mr Leung on Google+.  Amazon's rules, which refer to standards set by USB Implementers Forum, Inc., apply to any merchant selling items through its Amazon Sellers programme.  It's extremely unusual for modern hardware to be physically damaged due to connection issues, according to IHS analyst Ian Fogg.  "Fortunately, because few smartphones and laptops use the new USB-C design cables this risk of using cables which do not meet the USB-C specification, and which cause damage, has been limited to a relatively small number of consumers," he told the BBC.  "By acting now, Amazon greatly reduces the risk of large scale equipment failures as USB-C becomes the most popular connection type on new smartphones and laptops."  The first computers, smartphones and tablets to feature USB-C ports were released last year.  A list of compliant USB-C cables has been published by USB Implementers Forum, Inc.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35924859	FBI resists call to reveal Tor hacking secrets	The FBI is resisting calls to reveal how it identified people who used a child pornography site on the Tor anonymising network.  The agency was ordered to share details by a Judge presiding over a case involving one alleged user of the site.  Defence lawyers said they need the information to see if the FBI exceeded its authority when indentifying users.  But the Department of Justice (DoJ), acting for the FBI, said the details were irrelevant to the case.  "Knowing how someone unlocked the front door provides no information about what that person did after entering the house," wrote FBI agent Daniel Alfin in court papers filed by the DoJ which were excerpted on the Vice news site.  The Judge ordered the FBI to hand over details during a court hearing in late February.  The court case revolves around a "sting" the FBI carried out in early 2015 when it seized a Tor-based site called Playpen that traded in images and videos of child sexual abuse. The agency kept the site going for 13 days and used it to grab information about visitors who took part in discussion threads about images of child abuse.  Tor, aka The Onion Router, aims to hide the identity of people who use it by bouncing traffic through many different routers and encrypting it at each step. As well as letting people browse the web anonymously it has also given rise to hidden sites that sit on the Tor network.  The defence team is keen to see if the FBI's use of technical tricks to identify people on Tor exceeded the authorisations it got in a warrant to run the sting. It has argued that the investigative technique used by the FBI amounted to "gross misconduct".  The lawyers also want more details to ensure that their client has been properly identified.  In its legal filing, Mr Alfin said defence lawyers were "wrong" to think more information would help them work out if the FBI went further than it was allowed. It said the FBI had already provided details for the defence experts to work this out.  He also said he was confident that the defendant was properly identified. The DoJ documents conclude by asking the Judge to reconsider the order to reveal more information.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34474879	The anatomy of a nation-state hack attack	Cyber-security is not all about cyber-thieves. It is about cyber-spies too.  Mixed in among the spam, phishing messages and booby-trapped emails that land in your inbox might be the odd message crafted by hackers working for a government rather than a group of criminals.  Unfortunately, those messages are not odd in any other way. They look like every other net-borne threat. That is because the creators of these malicious programs usually exploit the same software vulnerabilities as mainstream malware, they can travel via the same hijacked PCs and they prey on the same human frailties that make the more typical stuff so successful.  Security companies have a hard time spotting them too, said Jordan Berry, a strategic intelligence analyst at security firm FireEye. Not least because the samples of malware cooked up by hackers backed by nation-states are small in number.  And, he said, the methods they use to infiltrate targets vary widely. Sometimes nations will dedicate a lot of time, talent and money to creating malware to work on their behalf.  That was the case with Stuxnet - a worm created to sabotage Iran's nuclear programme. Analysis of its electronic innards show it is a precision-guided weapon that probably took months to create. Stuxnet used four separate, previously unknown software vulnerabilities and only sprang into life when it found itself on a network with a very specific configuration.  But, said Mr Berry, not every attack employs such finely crafted malware.  "Sometimes they may not need to use the big guns," he said. "so they use something just to get the job done."  No matter which one hits a company or a government's network, exactly who was behind it becomes easier to understand once the malware gets to work.  "It's the context around it that's important," he said. "If its an attack on a Ministry of Foreign Affairs and there's not a lot of financial motivation behind it, then maybe it's a nation-state doing it."  In an attempt to get a better idea of just how sneaky nation-state malware can be, I asked Kevin O'Reilly from security firm Context IS to take me on a tour of the PlugX malware.  It was first discovered in mid-2012 and has been updated, altered and improved many times since then. It is believed to have been created by China and used in many campaigns against industrial targets in different nations as well as against dissident groups in Tibet and elsewhere, said Mr O'Reilly.  China seems to operate a franchise model when it comes to nation-state attacks, he said. As far as Context and others who watch Chinese malware can tell, the state creates the software and then hands it over to a lot of other groups who actually use it on its behalf.  However, said Mr O'Reilly, this was all conjecture as there was no direct evidence linking PlugX to China.  The modern version is pretty sneaky, he said, and uses several different techniques to infiltrate targets. The version I was shown around arrives as an attachment to an email.  The email is key to the attack, he said. The hacker groups that use PlugX typically do a lot of preparation before sending out booby-trapped email messages. They target a select group of people at one firm and craft the message to make it more appealing to them.  "Often," he added, "the documents are repurposed from legitimate sources, and 'weaponised' by embedding the exploit and malware dropper within them."  One of the documents that PlugX travels in was, ironically, a report about human rights abuses in Tibet.  Opening the document starts the process of infection. It gets in using an exploit or vulnerability in Windows that installs three files comprising the malware. The sneaky part is the way that two of these interact. One is a perfectly legitimate Windows file and as it runs it looks for a specific system file to get going.  PlugX includes the file it needs though this one is modified so it can install the actual malware. The way Windows works ensures it will use the one attached to the message rather than the safe one buried elsewhere on an infected computer.  "Once its got a foothold it makes sure it will run automatically with Windows and it will then phone home and be told to do whatever its controllers want it to do," said Mr O'Reilly. PlugX effectively gives attackers remote access to a computer on which it is installed.  "There's quite a lot of functionality built in," he said. "They might use the implant to get key logs or screen shots."  Its clear that it is doing different things to the run-of-the-mill malware that is looking to steal login credentials or credit card numbers.  "Ultimately," said Mr O'Reilly, "this is controlled by a person. It does not do much by itself."  Context is one of a few firms that have investigated breaches brought about with PlugX and it has used network forensics to replay where the attackers went and what they did.  "In one attack the intrusion was caught by the anti-virus and we were able to watch them go to the logs and try to clean them," he said. "They knew exactly where to go. That's the level of sophistication you are up against."  For veteran spy hunter Eric O'Neill, a former FBI agent who helped expose double agent Robert Hanssen, it should be no surprise that spies have gone digital.  "In the old days spies had to sneak into buildings to steal documents," he said. "Nowadays they don't. Espionage and spies have evolved."  A successful cyber campaign run by a nation-state could liberate far more information than any double agent could dream of securing, he said.  Attacks to steal data about people could well be carried out to give foreign powers a better idea of who was vulnerable and might be made to work for them.  "There are three main ways to recruit someone," he said. "Ideology, greed and blackmail."  Information in databases could give clues about medical conditions, debt or personal problems that might aid attempts to compromise an individual, he said.  "You have to know who you are attacking and whether they are more likely to swayed by ideology or greed or blackmail," he said.  "These types of attacks are not easy to do," said Mr O'Neill who now works for security firm Carbon Black. "But companies are foolish if they think that because it's hard they are not being targeted."  "These are spies, not hackers," he said. "You need to stop the spies, the people who are targeting other human beings. They are not just throwing stuff out hoping it hits."	tech

It marks the third call-back of electric cars over recent weeks.  Earlier this month, Nissan revealed it needed to reprogramme the software that controls its Leaf vehicles' brakes. Days later, Renault said it needed to check and replace faulty brake hoses on its Zoe cars.  The problems appear to be unrelated.  But one expert suggested that the fact that the technology involved in electric cars was both new and complex made the announcements unsurprising.  "The Volkswagen recall is more serious than the others, but even so I wouldn't say there's a fundamental problem," said Jay Nagley , managing director of the Redspy auto consultancy.  "Yes there are teething troubles, but the great thing about electric cars is they don't catch fire - they are the only product I know of, fitted with lithium-ion batteries, for which that is the case."  Details of the VW recall were posted online by the US's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).  It said there had been complaints of vehicles stalling unexpectedly, which could "increase the risk of a crash".  The documents state that the German manufacturer had acknowledged that its cars' battery management system could "inadvertently classify a brief internal electrical current surge/peak as a critical battery condition".  The result, it said, was that the battery shut down, which in turn deactivated the motor.  The e-Golf first went on sale in the US in late 2014, and the callback involves all 5,561 of the vehicles shipped to the country, including 157 that are as yet unsold.  The fix involves installing an update to the cars' battery management software, so that its diagnostic check becomes "less sensitive".  A spokesman for the firm was unable to say if it had plans to ask customers in other parts of the world to bring their cars in for the same fix.  Nissan's fault was reported by the same US agency.  The NHTSA said that during cold temperatures, a part used in the Nissan Leaf's electronic brake booster could freeze, requiring more effort to bring the vehicles to a halt.  "Longer distances or additional brake effort would be required to stop the vehicle, increasing the risk of a crash," said its report.  The Japanese firm had already told mechanics to address the issue via a software upgrade when the cars were brought in for a service.  But after Canada's transport watchdog urged Nissan in February to upgrade this to a full North American recall, it complied.  "Electric cars use regenerative braking, which is pretty novel, using energy to recharge the battery from the act of braking," commented Mr Nagley.  "It does make the system an awful lot more complicated than simply adding a pad to a disk.  "So, it's not totally surprising there are problems. But the Leaf is the bestselling and longest established electric car and they have earned a pretty good reputation."  A total of 47,538 Leaf cars - manufactured between November 2012 and July 2015 - require the new code, the vast majority of which are in the US.  The French firm said on 24 March that it needed to check the position of the Zoe's brake fluid hose to ensure it would not be damaged by coming into contact with a part designed to protect the vehicle's front wheel arch.  The company said it was not aware of any accidents.  The announcement affects 10,649 of the vehicles - including about 1,000 in the UK - which represents about one in four of the total number sold to date.  Attention on the electric car sector will be raised again later this week when Tesla announces its first model targeted at the mass market.  The California-based carmaker is expected to confirm its Model 3 will cost about $30,000 (£20,100).  The company has largely avoided the need to ask for its cars to be taken off the roads because it can issue "over-the-air" software updates.  These have included a fix issued in 2013 to make its cars' suspension provide more clearance over roads when travelling at high speeds.  However, the firm did recall its Model S vehicles last November to carry out a seatbelt inspection.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35916857	Cracked iPhone: Should you be worried?	The US government's declaration that it has "successfully accessed the data stored on [San Bernardino gunman] Farook's iPhone and therefore no longer requires" assistance from Apple, ends a six week-long legal clash between the tech firm and the FBI.  But it leaves the issue at the heart of the dispute unresolved: could the FBI have forced Apple to help it unlock the device?  It is unlikely that this will be the last time a law enforcement agency tries to compel a tech company to help bypass security measures.  It had been reported that there were about a dozen other cases in which the US Justice Department was pursuing court orders to force Apple to help its investigators.  The highest profile of these was in Brooklyn, New York, where the FBI wanted access to an iPhone belonging to a defendant who had already pleaded guilty to drug dealing.  In that case, a federal judge had rejected the DoJ's effort to invoke the All Writs Act - a three-centuries-old statute that allows court orders to be issued in circumstances where other laws don't apply.  The DoJ had launched an appeal, but it is not yet clear if it will continue or drop it. Its decision may be based on whether the technique used to extract data from Farook's handset can be used in other cases.  The New York case involved an iPhone 5S running the iOS 7 operating system, while the San Bernardino, California case was about an iPhone 5C running the more modern iOS 9. What works against one device might not work against the other.  But assuming the US government will at some point try again to use the All Writs Act to force Apple or some other tech company to circumvent its data protection measures, it may take a Supreme Court ruling to determine whether this is truly within the authorities' power.  At this point, there is nothing to compel the FBI to reveal how it was done, although Apple is likely to be pressing hard to find out.  The tech firm's lawyers have already said they would want details of the technique to be made public if evidence from the cracked iPhone is later used at trial.  But it could remain secret. There is scope within US law for the authorities to withhold the source of information if it was supplied to them on a confidential basis, and to protect sensitive intelligence-gathering methodologies.  The court order originally obtained by the FBI had instructed Apple to come up with a special version of its operating system that would have prevented Farook's iPhone from deleting its data or imposing long lockout periods if too many incorrect passcode guesses were made.  However, the latest court filings do not say that someone else has now done this, but merely that some data stored on the device has been obtained.  Researchers at the cybersecurity firm IOActive had proposed that one way of getting data off an iPhone would be to "de-cap" its memory chips.  The process they described involved using acid and lasers to expose and copy ID information about the device so that efforts to crack its passcode could be simulated on another computer without risk of triggering the original iPhone's self-destruct tool.  If indeed this is what happened, it is not easy and there's a high risk of causing so much damage to the phone that the desired data becomes irretrievable.  By contrast, Cellebrite - a data forensics firm that has reportedly helped the FBI with the case - has previously discussed "bypassing" passcode locks rather than trying to deduce the number.  But it is possible that doing this would yield access to only a limited amount of a handset's data.  One other point is that Apple recently updated its iOS software.  Each upgrade adds security fixes. So, if the FBI has indeed been alerted to a flaw in Farook's phone's security settings, that bug may no longer exist in devices that have installed iOS 9.3.  Short of destroying the device, perhaps no.  But you can use encryption-enabled apps to digitally scramble data.  The chat tool Wickr Messenger, for instance, lets you set it so that you have to enter a password each time you log back into the app.  Likewise, PQChat requires typing in a five-digit passcode of its own to get access.  So, even if a cracked iPhone did give up the contents of its text messages, emails and WhatsApp chats, the contents of the apps mentioned above should remain safe.  All this presumes, however, that the authorities do not manage to install spyware on your device. If that happens, all bets are off.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35915932	LGA: Living wage 'could put care services at breaking point'	Care services for the elderly and disabled could hit "breaking point" when the new National Living Wage comes into effect, councils say.  The Local Government Association estimates it could cost councils at least £330m in 2016-17 to cover increased contract costs.  It wants £700m of new government funding earmarked for social care by 2020 to be brought forward.  The government said it was offering more financial support to councils.  The government is allowing councils to raise council tax by 2% to help meet the rising costs of social care, under plans announced in the 2015 Autumn Statement.  According to Local Government Association (LGA) figures, this could bring in about £372m in 2016-17.  But it warns this could be wiped out by meeting the costs of the new £7.20 National Living Wage, for those aged over 25, which comes into force in April.  The LGA says the increased costs of contracts for home care and residential care providers could cost councils a minimum of £330m in 2016-17.  "The cost of implementing it will significantly add to the growing pressure on services caring for the elderly and disabled which are already at breaking point," said councillor Izzi Seccombe, the LGA's community wellbeing spokeswoman.  "A lack of funding is already leading to providers pulling out of the publicly-funded care market and shifting their attention towards people who are able to fully fund their own care.  "We know that care home and domiciliary care providers cannot be squeezed much further."  The government said care workers would benefit from the National Living Wage, and added that it was making up to £3.5bn available for councils to meet social care costs.  A spokesman said: "The new National Living Wage (NLW) is an essential part of moving to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society, where work always pays and the majority of households are better off.  "The NLW will benefit hundreds of thousands of care workers for the work they do and we are offering more financial support to councils to invest in that work - with access to up to £3.5bn to spend on social care."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35914489	Samsung becomes latest firm to launch mobile wallet in China	Samsung has officially launched its mobile wallet service in China, in co-operation with local vendor UnionPay.  Instead of using cards, the service allows shoppers to use their smartphones to pay for in-store purchases.  Last month, Apple launched its own Apple Pay system in China, also in partnership with UnionPay.  China's smartphone market, the largest in the world, presents a huge business opportunity for mobile-payment systems.  Samsung Pay and Apple Pay will now compete with Alibaba's Alipay, which currently dominates China's electronic payments market.  However analysts told the BBC that mobile payment services provided by Alipay and WeChat were so dominant in China that international newcomers such as Apple and Samsung would face "an uphill battle" to win market share.  Tencent's WeChat also has a payment system which is popular in China, and telecommunications giant Huawei launched its own service earlier this month.  Read more: Samsung Pay and how it works  The South Korean electronics giant said Samsung Pay was now available in China on a range of smartphones including the Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, Galaxy S6 edge+ and Galaxy Note5.  The firm said it would have "the opportunity to support additional mid-range models in the future".  In announcing its official launch, which has been expected since late last year, Samsung said that Samsung Pay currently supports select credit and debit cards of nine major banks in China including China CITIC Bank, China Construction Bank and China Everbright Bank.  Samsung has previously said it has one critical fact that will work in its favour: its technology works with a much larger number of existing payment terminals.  There has been a rapid take-up of smartphones in China, with an estimated 68% of the population now owning one. And digital wallets are becoming a more popular way to pay for goods and services.  Samsung said on Tuesday that its payment system was "simple, safe and easy to use" and that it worked "virtually anywhere you can swipe or tap your card in China".  Unlike Google Wallet and several other earlier payment apps, Samsung says there is no need to unlock its phones to launch a special app to get started.  Like Apple Pay, Samsung Pay will use near field communication technology (NFC), which needs a separate transaction device, but it will also support magnetic secure transmission technology which works on regular credit card machines.  However, Bryan Ma of IDC research firm told the BBC that Samsung would face the same challenges that Apple does in China.  "The use of Alipay and WeChat are so dominant in China that it's an uphill battle for both phone vendors, aside from some higher-end users in larger cities," he said.  "Making it worse for Samsung is it doesn't have the cachet that Apple does. And Samsung was number six in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter of last year, with only 7% share, versus Apple at number two with 15% share," he added.  Samsung Pay is currently available in South Korea and the US. It is expected to become available in the UK this year.	tech

The BBC's Micro Bit finally launched last week just as the children headed off for the Easter holidays.  Many won't get their hands on the tiny computers until they return from their spring break in mid-April, although the hope is that some will play with their new devices at home over the vacation.  The BBC has bigger ambitions for the little machine, hoping that it will help kickstart a revolution in coding in the same way as its big brother the BBC Micro did in the 1980s.  But how will the Micro Bit - which currently is only on offer to 11 and 12-year-olds around the UK - inspire a generation and what exactly will it inspire them to do?  The project is late - and there was clearly a rush to get it into the hands of children before most schools broke up for Easter.  This delay is perhaps unsurprising - it is a complex task launching new hardware especially with the huge range of partners that the BBC is working with - but it has frustrated teachers who are hastily rewriting lesson plans, initially slated for the beginning of the academic year.  It mean that schools now only have one term to start using the device in classrooms and, perhaps more worryingly, when this year group of students leave the classroom at the end of the summer term they will take the Micro Bits with them, thanks to a decision to give the devices to individuals rather than to schools.  "It is vital that there is a fresh supply of Micro Bits each year for it to have a long-term, sustainable future," said Bill Mitchell, director of education at the British Computing Society (BCS).  The BBC has said that the devices will be made commercially available from next year although there is little detail about how this will work or how much they will cost.  The BBC Micro became the centrepiece of the BBC's first computer literacy push in the 1980s and a hugely influential piece of kit.  When it hit the market, an estimated 60% of primary schools and 85% of secondary schools adopted it and many of the influential leaders in the technology industry now cite it as having been crucial to their computing careers.  Now those willing the Micro Bit to succeed hope for similar.  "Many of our volunteers and staff say that they learnt to code using a BBC Micro and we want to replicate that with the Micro Bit," said Code Club director Clare Sutcliffe.  Separate to the roll-out of the device to a million schoolchildren, the BBC is also making extra ones available to after-school clubs such as Code Club.  "We will be getting 20,000 Micro Bits in a few weeks time and we plan to give them to the venues so that they can be used over and over again," said Ms Sutcliffe.  There is no doubting the fun that children can have with the Micro Bit and it has already inspired a bunch of interesting projects but what is the longer-term goal of the technology?  Those who argue in favour of the hands-on approach to computer science say that, just as children learning about Shakespeare need to see the Bard's plays performed to truly understand the work, so those learning about computing need to get under the bonnet.  "The Micro Bit is a device that interacts with the physical world and children can see that the device can have a physical effect, which helps them understand how computation can solve problems in the real world. That is hugely important," said Mr Mitchell.  He hopes it will create a new generation of school leavers who can "analyse real-world problems and find an algorithm to solve them", which he said will not only put the UK leaps and bounds ahead of other countries but will also help those children as they enter adult life - whatever profession that they choose to pursue.  "There is a misapprehension that the new curriculum is about churning out a generation of computer programmers but that is not the case," said Mr Mitchell.  "It is about creating a generation of children who can think computationally."  That is something governments around the world are recognising and back in 2014 the UK overhauled the ICT curriculum, which had drifted from teaching hardcore programming in the 1980s to classes about how to use Word and create a spreadsheet from the 1990s onwards.  And in the US, President Barack Obama pledged to provide $4 billion in funding for computer science education in US schools.  The UK's national curriculum now acknowledges that "high quality computing education equips pupils to use computational thinking and creativity to understand and change the world".  The shift in thinking harks back to the era of the BBC Micro although this time around, Mr Mitchell hopes to inspire more than just the computer geeks.  "In truth the BBC Micro only reached around 10% of children - those who were interested in hardcore programming. For the rest, it was just far too challenging to get to grips with," he said.  The onslaught of new, user-friendly programming languages coupled with gadgets such as the Micro Bit offers a whole new world of opportunity, he thinks.  The BCS estimates that a quarter of UK schools are doing "an excellent job" in implementing the new computer science curriculum.  The challenge now, said Mr Mitchell, is to convince head teachers in the other three-quarters to put computer science on a par with subjects such as maths and English.  Micro Bit is not the only tiny computer on the market - CodeBug is another similar device designed to introduce kids to programming.  And Swedish start-up Quirkbot is shipping a little device that allows children to programme and construct a creature out of LED's, motors and drinking straws.  It is working with five Swedish schools and a dozen others around the world to create classroom content for its device.  My son is a year too old to get his hands on the first generation of Micro Bit, but he had a go at programming a Quirkbot for a recent STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) project at his school.  As a parent what I noticed was the pride he took when the programming worked.  He agreed that it was worth the effort.  "I found it hard to begin with but I got to grips with it using trial and error. I felt a sense of achievement when I made it move and light up. I think it is a useful tool, but personally I find it challenging."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35910492	Oculus founder delivers first Rift headset in person	The founder of VR (virtual reality) firm Oculus has hand delivered the first Rift headset to a customer.  Palmer Luckey handed over the headset a couple of days before the consumer version of the Rift is officially due to start reaching customers.  The recipient was Ross Martin from Alaska who ordered the headset when pre-orders opened in January.  Mr Luckey said he wanted the "satisfaction" of delivering the first Rift headset.  On 28 March, the consumer-ready Rift headsets should start to reach people who were among the first to order it in January.  Before now the only versions of the headset available were made so developers could familiarise themselves with the software and hardware in the device. The consumer-ready Rift has improved lenses and electronics to make VR as immersive as possible.  Mr Luckey said it was important to him to hand over the headset given that he had been involved in its development since 2009.  "I'll be damned if some random delivery guy is going to get the satisfaction of delivering the first Rift," he told game news site Polygon. "That's mine."  A video of the handover was posted to Mr Palmer's page on Facebook. Oculus was bought by Facebook in March 2014 for $2bn (£1.41bn).  Mr Martin said he had no idea that his headset was going to be handed over by Mr Luckey.  He said he received an email saying it would be delivered on Saturday but assumed everyone who pre-ordered got the same message.  It was only when he rang to confirm delivery that he realised who was handing it over.  Mr Luckey said he only had one regret about the stunt, which was wearing flip-flops while walking around in Alaska during the winter.  The Rift is the first of the sophisticated consumer-ready VR headsets to reach customers. A rival device from HTC is set to reach people in April and the headset for Sony's PlayStation will be available in October.  The PlayStation headset is the cheapest of the three, retailing at $399 in the US and £350 in the UK. By contrast the Oculus costs $599 (£499) and the HTC $799 (£689).	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35906440	Drop 'dangerous' Border Force cuts, says Andy Burnham	Labour has urged the government to drop "dangerous cuts" to the Border Force.  Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham told the BBC there "couldn't be a more serious time" to be strengthening borders, after the Brussels attacks.  But he quoted whistleblowers as saying the Border Force had been told to expect cuts of 6% in both the next financial year and the one after.  The Home Office said funding was being finalised and "all necessary measures" would be taken to secure UK borders.  In a letter to Home Secretary Theresa May, Mr Burnham said making savings now would be a "very serious mistake".  In the wake of the Brussels bombings, the government said it was deploying more Border Force staff to strengthen checks at UK entry points.  But Mr Burnham accused the home secretary of "going to great lengths" to conceal further cuts planned for the agency.  He said it was "highly unusual and should be challenged" for ministers not to have released the Border Force budget with the start of the new financial year only a few days away.  He said the force had "already experienced consecutive years of cuts" and was "stretched to the limit".  "The public has a right to know about the government's plans for the UK border and that is why I call on them to publish these figures without delay and to drop these damaging cuts," he added.  The Home Office said extra money for the force had been promised in the chancellor's Budget this month.  A spokesman said the government had "invested tens of millions of pounds to bolster security at ports in northern France" and would take "all the necessary measures" to maintain the security of the UK's borders.  Mr Burnham said the funding promised in the Budget was for customs activities of the Border Force, to counter smuggling, not for immigration staff.  He called on the government to strengthen the UK's sea, rail and air borders with Belgium, saying British border officials should be deployed to work alongside local staff in Belgian ports, as already happens in Calais.  The Home Office said the Border Force "has the ability to redeploy resources on a national basis, and can allocate funding to address specific pressures when necessary.  "This includes the additional £17m being invested during the next financial year to ease migrant pressures in the Calais region and further strengthen the UK border."  It said it was "not uncommon" for the force's budget to be finalised this close to the financial year and the home secretary would respond to Mr Burnham's letter "in due course".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35889662	Tech eases Syrians' trauma in Jordanian refugee camp	The thousands of dusty shops and houses do not at first seem like a place where technology would thrive.  But the Zaatari refugee camp near the Syrian border in Jordan houses a vibrant community of makers.  The majority of the residents are from the Syrian city of Daraa, commonly called the cradle of the revolution for the role it played in early anti-government protests.  The camp was formed four years ago when people fled the war across the border. Now, more than 80,000 people are estimated to live in Zaatari.  Despite the incredible hardships many have faced, there is a vibrant entrepreneurial spirit here.  The camp's main street is called Sham Elysees. It's a play on ash-Sham - a word Syrians call Damascus - and the famous Parisian boulevard, Champs Elysees. Hundreds of shops line the street, covering everything from wedding dresses to mobile phone repair shops.  It's here we meet disabled inventor Sawfan Harb who has lived in Zaatari for three years. He fled Syria with two family members, who are also disabled.  Sawfan found it difficult living in the camp when he first arrived as many roads were not paved and he didn't want to rely on people to push or carry him in his wheelchair.  He discussed with his brother the possibility of creating an electric bike out of spare parts in the camp. With the help of a local welder his plans were brought to life.  "Because of my disability I'm forced to be creative and find ways to help me live my life as easily as possible, be it in Syria or here, it's the same," he says.  "People were at first surprised to see such a bike in the camp. They've never seen anything like it before. Some liked it, others were just surprised."  Of course, there are many barriers to refugees living in the camp accessing technology. Electricity is only on for half the day in the camp and money is in short supply.  Safwan would like to enhance his technical skills with academic courses.  "If possible I would like to study technology because I have ideas but I need academic learning," he says.  "I have other ideas but I have no support, even a simple idea needs a certain amount of money."  Syrian refugees entering Jordan have their irises scanned by the UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) using IrisGuard technology.  This biometric data is collected to confirm identities but also provides services from local partners to help make life a bit more normal for refugees. This includes the Cairo Amman Bank, which is linked to the biometric database and sets up an account automatically for each family.  A nominated family member can take aid money out in the blink of an eye at bank machines. There is no need to register information again with the bank as it comes through the UNHCR's secure EyeCloud server based in Amman.  The data is also shared between four countries: Egypt, Jordan Lebanon and Iraq, to ensure people aren't registered in two countries at the same time.  More refugees live in Jordan's capital Amman than in refugee camps. Finding ways to integrate them into Jordanian society and provide access to technology is the focus of a group of companies and philanthropists called Refugee OpenWare.  Its focus is on how to deploy advanced technologies to improve human rights in conflict zones and host communities for refugees.  In a modern office park full of start-ups is 3Dmena, a core member of the group which mainly works on fabrication technologies, including 3D printing.  A row of Ultimaker printers lines one wall of its office; a machine the company is trying to convert to 3D-print food sits in the corner.  "We focus on advanced technologies like 3D printing, internet-of-things, robotics, virtual reality and how we engage physical and traditional industries in digital fabrication," says 3Dmena's co-founder Loay Malahmeh.  Mr Malahmeh also reaches out to Syrian refugees to work at his company. Asem Hasna worked as a paramedic driving an ambulance in Syria.  He lost his left leg in a bomb explosion. He was working in a traditional prosthetic centre in Amman when he saw one of 3Dmena's 3D printers the team had brought to the hospital for a fitting.  Within three weeks Mr Hasna became proficient in 3D printing and hacked the printer to print in a material it hadn't been able to before. He even taught people from Jordan's Royal Rehabilitation Hospital how to use it. He became 3Dmena's technical director.  One of the devices Mr Hasna created was an echolocation device using haptic feedback. It buzzes the hand of a Syrian refugee who was blinded by a sniper, helping to alert him to objects in his way so he can walk more confidently.  The solutions they are printing are relatively inexpensive, which could help provide cheaper prosthetic solutions to people with little money. Mr Hasna's prosthetic foot needs a rubber element to be replaced twice a year which usually costs around $35 (£25).  But with the printer he could manufacture the part in a flexible material in under 30 minutes for just $1.50.  Besides training refugees who are living in Amman, 3Dmena hopes to bring a fabrication lab with different computer controlled machines - including wood-working, metal workshops and 3D printers - directly to the refugee camp.  Mr Malahmeh hired a professor of conflict studies to do research in Zaatari over a period of two months, conducting more than 270 surveys and 65 focus groups.  More than 95% of respondents said they felt having a platform for 3D printing in Zaatari would have a big impact. More than 45% said they would use it at least three times a week to solve problems relating to shelter, transport, electricity, sanitation and food production systems.  But for now, 3Dmena is focused on setting up operations in Turkey and Gaza.  "Unfortunately we received a rejection letter due to a lot of security issues, so the project in Zaatari is on hold," says Mr Malahmeh.  "But hopefully, if we get approval, we can do it."  UK-based readers can watch Jen Copestake's full report from Zaatari on iPlayer.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35899887	Amazon's Raspberry Pi guide lets coders use Alexa	Amazon has published an online guide explaining how to access its virtual assistant Alexa via a Raspberry Pi.  The technique presents a lower-cost alternative to buying one of its Echo devices - which are not yet available outside of the US - and an incentive to gain computer skills.  The walkthrough includes access to the necessary app data and certificates in order to link the budget computer up to the tech giant's servers.  The Raspberry Pi pocket-sized computer was designed by a British charity to encourage children and others to learn how to write computer programs. More than eight million units have been sold or given away.  Amazon says that users require at least the second-generation model, released in February 2015, as well as:  Most Raspberry Pi owners would already own most if not all of these add-ons.  The coding involved is limited to typing in sets of commands, but the guide explains the purpose of each one.  Users also need to register for an Amazon Developer Account, which they can get for free.  Rik Cross, from the UK's after-school Code Club initiative, described it as an "interesting project", but added that parents should be aware of the privacy implications involved.  "It's important to remember that this data could be captured and stored by Amazon, in the same way that any website can store the data provided," he told the BBC.  "However, with the Raspberry Pi version, communication is via a button press, and so this serves as a much more 'active' way of interacting with the service, rather than a service that 'passively' listens to all your nearby conversations, as is the case with the Echo."  Amazon's Alexa service can be used to stream music, provide weather and news updates, create lists and answer general knowledge questions.  The online retailer was relatively late to the field - following Apple's Siri, Microsoft's Cortana and Google's Now services.  But the firm has sought to make Alexa popular by allowing third-party developers to offer the facility. An internet connection is required because Amazon's own data centres do the processing required for the voice recognition and other artificial intelligence tasks involved.  France's Invoxia became the first to take up the offer last year with Triby, an Alexa-powered fridge speaker.  In January, a New York-based developer released a tutorial of his own explaining how a Raspberry Pi could be used to create an Echo-like device.  But Amazon's guide, which has been published on the code-sharing site Github, is likely to drive interest in the idea.  "Anything that helps people to make and create with the technology that was otherwise closed, mysterious and inaccessible seems like a good thing to me," commented Bethany Koby, founder of Technology Will Save Us - an education-focused start-up currently involved with the launch of another mini-computer, the Micro Bit.  "What it doesn't do is create a way for a broader 'untechy' audiences to partake - but that isn't really its intention."  Those not attracted by the idea can download an Alexa app for devices powered by Google's Android or Apple's iOS operating systems - however, the apps are restricted to US-based users at this time.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35898797	Netflix throttles data to some mobile networks	Netflix has acknowledged that it restricts the quality of its video streams when it sends them over some mobile data networks.  The firm blogged that it did this "globally". A spokesman confirmed that this included streams sent via UK mobile operators.  However, some firms - including T-Mobile and Sprint in the US - are not affected by the cap.  Netflix said its intention was to stop its members facing excess charges.  But one of the US's biggest networks has reacted with anger.  "We're outraged to learn that Netflix is apparently throttling video for their AT&T customers without their knowledge or consent," AT&T told the Wall Street Journal.  AT&T and Verizon, another US operator, had been accused of imposing the restrictions themselves as a result of confusion caused by a recent T-Mobile ad campaign.  "Here's a little factoid for you," said T-Mobile's chief executive John Legere in a video posted on 17 March.  "Did you know that when you watch Netflix on T-Mobile you get it at 480p [resolution]?  "The duopoly is actually delivering your Netflix content at 360p. I'll bet you didn't know that. Go check. it's true."  Netflix indicated the discrepancy was due to the fact that T-Mobile and Sprint slowed down customers' data speeds, rather than charging them more money, when they went over their usage limit.  Netflix's chief executive has previously described himself as being a defender of "strong net neutrality".  "The essence of net neutrality is that ISPs [internet service providers] don't restrict, influence or otherwise meddle with the choices consumers make," Reed Hastings wrote in 2014.  The firm has now said it recognises that subscribers might also want to have greater control over the speeds that Netflix itself provides to mobile ISPs in the first place.  The 600 kilobits per second cap cap it currently enforces is a fraction of the 30 megabits per second download speeds that are now possible over 4G in parts of the UK.  "We will soon introduce a data-saver feature designed for mobile apps," said Netflix spokeswoman Anne Marie Squeo.  "[Users will be able to] either stream more video under a smaller data plan, or increase their video quality if they have a higher data plan."  She added that the feature should become available in May.	tech

The iOS 9.3 update caused some older versions of the phones and tablets to require the IDs and passwords originally used to set them up.  Many people complained that their machines had become unusable because they had forgotten or did not know the details.  It has also stopped vulnerable devices being able to download the software and begun issuing new versions of the operating system - which ditch the ID check - for affected machines.  Dozens of users complained about the problem on Apple's community forum saying their handsets and tablets had been "bricked" after installing the update.  The tech firm has since acknowledged that the issue affected its iPhone 5S and earlier smartphones as well as its iPad Air and earlier tablets.  As a solution, Apple suggested that users remove the activation lock by signing into their iCloud account's Find My Phone function or by connecting their device to a computer and entering their current Apple ID details into iTunes.  But some users will still face problems if their current account had not been linked to the device.  One iPhone owner who inherited an iPhone from a deceased partner has reported still being unable to bypass the lock, as has someone who bought the device from a seller that they were no longer in contact with.  Under such circumstances, Apple says people need to contact its support team for further aid.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35874420	Google to expand Android Pay digital wallet to UK	Google has said that it will extend Android Pay to the UK "in the next few months".  The facility allows any device running Android 4.4 or higher and fitted with an NFC (near field communication) chip to act as a tap-and-pay substitute for credit and debit cards.  Several lenders, including Lloyds Bank, HSBC and Nationwide have said they will support the scheme.  Samsung earlier said its rival service would also come to the UK this year.  The South Korean handset maker has yet to be more specific about its British launch plans for Samsung Pay, which is restricted to its own Android smartphones.  Apple Pay has been available in the UK since July 2015 but is limited to the firm's iOS devices, so will not compete directly with Google's service.  At present, Android Pay is only available in the US, where it became available in September.  A Google spokeswoman said it was now "likely" that the UK would become its second market since no announcement about other expansion plans had been made to date.  The service requires a user to first store details of their cards within the app, and then provide a fingerprint scan or passcode to authorise a payment.  It can be used in stores and restaurants as an alternative to tapping a card on a point-of-sale terminal, or within apps to avoid having to type in account details.  In theory, it is safer to use than a physical credit or debit card as the owner does not need to reveal their account number at point of purchase, and even if someone was able to intercept the transmitted encrypted information, they could not re-use it to authorise further payments.  Google said it had struck deals with Visa and Mastercard to allow the service to stand in for their cards, as well as several UK's financial institutions including:  That still leaves several big names missing, including American Express, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander - but Google said it intended to add more organisations to the list ahead of the launch.  Google's blog, which revealed the announcement, said that Android Pay had been "growing steadily in the US with 1.5 million new registrations happening each month".  But one expert suggested it was lagging behind Samsung's rival offering.  "Samsung Pay has made a bigger impact here than Android Pay and is being advertised more heavily," said Carolina Milanesi, a California-based analyst at Kantar Worldpanel Comtech.  "If you look at the type of early adopters most likely to buy into the idea of wanting to do everything via their smartphone, they normally fit with the type of person who buys a high-end Apple or Samsung device."  Many stores in the US are still moving from magnetic strip-based terminals to chip-and-pin systems, which gives Samsung another advantage as its facility works with both.  It is a different case in the UK, where chip-and-pin has been the de facto standard for several years.  One industry watcher said that while in-store payments were a useful feature, it was Android Pay and other digital wallets' in-app functions that should drive their adoption.  "Most people have contactless cards in the UK already, and [they are already easy to use] when nipping into a shop to buy something," commented Dave Birch, a payments specialist at Consult Hyperion.  "But if you are an online service provider or any kind - whether you are Waitrose or Airbnb - you want to provide the best experience for the customer.

The U-turn came after the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs said poppers should not be banned.  Popper-using MP Crispin Blunt led a Commons attempt in January to exempt poppers from what he said would be a "fantastically stupid" ban.  Popular with gay men, "poppers" is the name given to liquid chemicals called alkyl nitrates, which are sniffed.  Last week, the advisory council said its "consensus view is that a psychoactive substance has a direct action on the brain and that substances having peripheral effects, such as those caused by alkyl nitrites, do not directly stimulate or depress the central nervous system".  In a letter responding, Home Office Minister Karen Bradley said: "Having given due consideration, the government agrees with your advice and interpretation of the definition."  She added: "Our understanding is that this approach does not have any further implications for the operation of the act and that other substances that the act intends to cover are not affected.  "We remain confident that the psychoactivity of those substances can be established under the definition in the act.  "We will ask law enforcement agencies to be guided by our agreement with your advice."  The Psychoactive Substances Act will bring in a blanket ban on the production, distribution, sale and supply of "designer drugs".  Sellers will face up to seven years in prison.  There were 11 deaths in England and Wales between 1993 and 2013 where the death certificate only mentioned an alkyl nitrate, according to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs.	politics

A review of the Lords' powers was set up after peers voted down planned tax credits cuts - later axed by ministers.  But its scope has been criticised by two Lords committees who say its proposals would "damage" Parliament's role and should be shelved.  Unlike in the Commons, the Tories do not have a majority in the of Lords.  The review, carried out by ex-Lords leader Lord Strathclyde, recommended taking away the absolute veto the Lords had over statutory instruments - a form of legislation implemented without Parliament having to pass an Act - and instead limiting them to sending the secondary (or delegated) legislation back to the Commons to "think again".  They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagreed.  But in separate reports published on Wednesday, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the Constitution Committee said weakening parliamentary scrutiny of secondary legislation "would tilt the balance of power away from Parliament… towards government".  Criticising the scope of the review, they said it was "not a proper basis for determining constitutional change" and warned the recommendations "will only damage Parliament's role and reputation".  "A six week review based on informal consultation following highly politicised events in both Houses is not a proper basis for determining constitutional change," the Constitution Committee said.  Secondary or delegated legislation allows the government to make changes to a law without needing to push through a completely new act of Parliament.  This can occur when primary legislation (an act of Parliament) specifies that changes to the law may be delegated to ministers in certain circumstances in future.  It may allow ministers to make technical changes to the law, like altering the level of a fine, but it can also sanction broader changes like fleshing out an act with greater detail.  The cross-party committees said the government should shelve the plans and allow both Houses of Parliament to consider the way in which secondary legislation is scrutinised.  Chairman Lord Lang of Monkton, a Conservative peer, said: "The Strathclyde Review was asked the wrong questions by the government.  "The role of the House of Lords in rejecting the tax credits regulations was not about the House of Lords versus the House of Commons; it was about Parliament scrutinising the government."  Baroness Fookes, chairman of the Delegated Powers Committee, said she welcomed the review for "shining a spotlight - perhaps unintentionally - on the unfortunate tendency of successive governments to leave substantial issues of policy and principle to be dealt with by delegated legislation".  "At best this is sloppy practice, and at worst it gives ministers far too much power to do whatever they want without sufficient scrutiny by Parliament," she added.  She said the committee would be "more demanding" of ministers and demand answers if they "seek substantial and wide powers without adequate explanation".  The review of the Lords' powers has been criticised by the Labour Party, which said it was a "massive over-reaction" to the tax credits defeat and accused ministers of "intimidating" the Lords.	politics

It highlights the risk of investing in product ideas before they have actually launched.  Ampy says the complaints are being made by a small minority.  The battery pack is designed to be worn on the arm or elsewhere around the body.  The idea is that movement shakes internal magnets which generate current that is then stored in the battery. There are three LEDs which indicate how much energy is stored - three lights means it is fully charged.  While this is its main selling point, the Ampy can also be charged by being plugged into the wall.  The battery retails at $100 (£70). The armband costs a further $29 (£20) and there are additional customs fees payable on deliveries outside of the US.  Ampy has received more than $300,000 (£207,000) in crowd funding from 2,573 backers and a further $875,000 (£604,000) in venture capital investment.  The BBC could only find one positive comment on the device's Kickstarter page (it is now closed but investors can still leave feedback) since the Ampy shipped in November 2015.  However, the firm says it has shipped "between 6,000 and 7,000 units" so far, has issued 71 refunds and honoured 68 warrantee claims.  Its reviews on Amazon are polarised with (at time of writing) 39% giving it five stars and 31% one star.  There are 10 five-star reviews. One of those writers said it had changed her life while another described it as "super helpful".  Three of the 10 reviewers have never reviewed anything on Amazon apart from Ampy, according to their profiles. Three more were anonymous and one had not written a single review in more than two years.  "No matter what I did, I couldn't get the Ampy to generate any reasonable amount of juice," wrote Sean Hollister.  So what's going on?  I decided to buy one myself and find out.  After a 60-minute run I had not even generated enough charge to light the first of the three LEDs.  I then gave it to my children's dad who then wore it during an energetic play in the park with our two sons. When he got back, I jumped on a friend's garden trampoline for half an hour, holding the Ampy and giving it a good shake.  After all that, there was still no LED activity. When I plugged in my phone it charged for just over three minutes but the battery percentage on the phone itself remained unchanged at 67%.  Then I flung it in my handbag where it remained for days while I stomped around with it at work and out with my kids (apparently bag action also counts). Still nothing.  One reviewer, after far more technical tests than mine, and a teardown of the device itself came to the conclusion that it would take "36 hours of activity" to fully charge the Ampy battery itself.  "I think when you tell people you move and then you can charge your phone - people have a high expectation of that and it will seem almost magical," co-founder Alex Smith told me.  "We can say this product isn't for everyone. It is for people who have an active lifestyle".  This however is not explicit on the Ampy website.  He said I should have seen better results from my activities and asked me about the make of my smartphone, how old it was and how bright the screen setting was - all limiting factors in the effectiveness of the device, he said.  "One of the issues is, when this product came out, the most popular phone on the market was iPhone 5. Since then phones have got a lot bigger. The battery is twice as big. Most power from comes from screen size," he added.  "A Fitbit gives you badges, this gives you battery life," he said.  "We are not promising it is going to replace [charging at the] wall."  On the subject of negative feedback he said it is "often difficult to meet people's expectations".  "We think a lot of our customers are very happy," he added.  "The ones who aren't are the most vocal".  Ampy put me in touch with four supportive Kickstarter backers.  They were all pleased to have invested in the concept and liked the device - but three of them admitted that the motion charge they were actually generating was very small.  "I have to wear it all day and maybe I'll be able to charge my phone for five or six minutes," said Di-Lan Sun in the Netherlands.  "But I think it's a great way of doing something with sustainable power. That's important."  Martin Stradling in Canada agreed that the motion charging "wasn't as good" as he expected.  "Everything has to start somewhere.... it's the right idea and a step in the right direction," he said.  Rocco Turso in South Carolina said he kept his Ampy charged via his computer and "topped up" with movement and walker Laurene Beattie said she kept the Ampy in her bag and was able to recharge her phone by up to 50% when needed but added that while she always carried it, she did not use it every day.  Clare Grey is a chemistry professor at Cambridge University and an expert on energy storage. I asked her for her thoughts.  By her calculations it would take 13 hours to fully charge the battery of an iPhone 6, based on the current capacity of the Ampy as described on the firm's blog.  "The energy required for [smartphone-like] devices is substantial," she said.  "You're making use of something you're doing anyhow but the general problem with energy harvesting is that all these methods are not very efficient."  However it would be unwise to write off these sorts of devices just yet, she added.  "Energy-harvesting devices have a role to play and will increasingly play a role in the internet-connected lifestyles we will have," Prof Grey said.  A spokesman for Kickstarter said that crowdfunders who invested in hardware products were supporting their development rather than the actual products.  "It's a system that works best when creators are open and honest about their progress and the challenges they're facing," he said in an email.  "There's always a risk that a project won't turn out as planned."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35877743	Tory MP Jake Berry calls for new criminal offence of breast ironing	The government has been urged to introduce a new criminal offence of breast ironing in the UK to protect young girls from the abuse.  The practice involves using hot objects to pound and massage girls' breasts to try to stunt their growth in the belief it makes them less sexually attractive.  MP Jake Berry said about 1,000 girls in the UK were thought to be affected by the "abhorrent practice".  The government said police could charge culprits with a range of offences.  Home Office minister Karen Bradley said the government was "absolutely committed" to putting a stop to the practice.  But she admitted "certain professionals" still felt reticent about tackling such practices because of "cultural sensitivities" - and said they needed to be given the confidence to take action.  Opening the debate in the Commons, Mr Berry said breast ironing was believed to have originated in Cameroon but cases had also been found in Nigeria, Benin, Chad "and Birmingham and London".  He said it was "hard to prove its extent or prevalence in the UK" because, like female genital mutilation (FGM), the fact the practice "most often carried out by a family member" meant it was "hidden".  According to a UN report, 58% of perpetrators were the victims' own mothers.  The MP for Rossendale and Darwen said girls as young as 10 were subjected to "unimaginable pain and suffering" and exposed to potential health problems including cancer, infection and cysts.  "Hot stones, hammers and spatulas are used twice a day for several weeks or months to stop or delay and in some cases permanently destroy the natural development of the breast," he said.  Culture, tradition and religion were often used to justify the practice, Mr Berry said, adding: "But just as in the case of FGM these words are a thinly veiled excuse for a ritualised form of child abuse." It had "no place in any society", he said.  Mr Berry said 15% of UK police forces had no awareness of breast ironing and 23% of local children's services were not trained to deal with it, with 65% saying they would welcome more guidance.  "If we fail to let them have the tools they require to identify and understand the victims of this crime, we will never be able to tackle it," he told the Commons.  "My understanding is that there is currently no stand-alone crime of breast ironing in the UK, with police and prosecutors relying on the existing pool of criminal offences available to them.  "Just like with FGM, this... is not an adequate protection for young women and girls in our country," the MP added.  Home Office minister Karen Bradley said there was a range of offences available to the police to tackle the crime including common assault, child cruelty and grievous bodily harm.  "What we're talking about is child abuse, it is illegal, it is a crime, it is not acceptable.  "I want to assure the House that the government fully understands this and is absolutely committed to putting a stop to it," she said.  Pressed over the role of schools in tackling such harmful practices, the minister said "there are certain professionals who may feel reticent about this".  She added: "They may feel that somehow there are cultural sensitivities, there are political reasons why they shouldn't go there.  "This is simply not the case and we need to give those professionals the confidence to know that this is something that they should be looking for, that they know what the signs are and that they take action because that is what we all need to do."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35877442	MPs approve Chancellor George Osborne's Budget	MPs have approved the Budget after Chancellor George Osborne was forced to shelve planned cuts to disability benefits.  The changes had led to a rift in the Tory Party and the resignation of Iain Duncan Smith from the cabinet.  Ahead of the vote, Mr Osborne defended his handling of the economy, but told MPs that where mistakes were made he was ready "to listen and learn".  The Budget was accepted by 310 votes to 275, a government majority of 35.  The government also won a series of votes on specific Budget resolutions, including the cut in capital gains tax.  Opposition amendments to scrap the "tampon tax" and block an increase in VAT on solar panels were accepted by the government without the need for a vote.  Remaining Budget measures will be brought forward in the Finance Bill and other legislation which will be debated after the Easter recess.  The vote came after days of highly charged debate on the Budget, which was overshadowed by the row over disability benefits and the fallout from Mr Duncan Smith's resignation as work and pensions secretary.  In a rare move, the chancellor introduced the final day's debate and confirmed to MPs that he would not proceed with planned cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs).  He said the changes, likely to have affected up to 640,000 people, did not "command support".  "I have made it clear that where we've made a mistake, where we've got things wrong, we listen and we learn. That's precisely what we've done," he said.  And he told MPs no further welfare savings were anticipated beyond the £12bn already approved by Parliament towards his target of balancing the books by 2020.  But Labour demanded an explanation as to how Mr Osborne would plug the £4.4bn gap in the Budget left by the rethink.  Former work and pensions secretary Yvette Cooper said he would either have to raid the welfare budget further or "ditch" his self-imposed cap on overall benefits spending.  Mr Osborne said the cost of abandoning the policy could be absorbed because public spending was under control.  Labour also called on the chancellor to apologise for his attempt to introduce the cuts.  And shadow chancellor John McDonnell questioned Mr Osborne's "fitness for the office he now holds".  Ms Osborne was a "political chancer" whose "grubby, incompetent manipulations" could not be defended, he said.  Mr Duncan Smith resigned on Friday over the proposals to cut disability benefits at the same that taxes were being cut for higher earners.  In his resignation letter, he said the latest cuts were a "compromise too far" and flew in the face of David Cameron's and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  In the Commons, Mr Osborne said he was sorry Mr Duncan Smith had resigned and told MPs he was proud of their work together in government.  He praised his former colleague for "helping to make work pay, protecting the vulnerable and breaking the decades-old cycle of welfare dependency".  But the chancellor rejected Mr Duncan Smith's charge that his fiscal targets risked dividing society and that working-age benefit claimants were being unduly penalised by a "desperate search" for savings.  "Without sound public finances there is no social justice," he told MPs.  He said spending on disability benefits would still be higher in 2020 than it was now and 300,000 people with disabilities had found work in the past couple of years.  In separate votes on several Budget resolutions, proposals to cut capital gains tax and increase the insurance premium tax were endorsed by MPs.  Increases in the landfill tax were also passed by the House with a 235 majority, after being approved by English, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs by 296 votes to 10 under the "English votes for English laws" procedure.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35874421	Sony closes Driveclub's Evolution Studios	Sony has announced the closure of the UK's Evolution Studios.  The Cheshire-based video games development house dates back to 1999, and had most recently worked on the troubled PlayStation title Driveclub.  Sony has confirmed that there will be at least some compulsory redundancies as a consequence of its decision.  The announcement closely follows Microsoft's announcement of plans to close another British developer, Lionhead Studios.  Sony said that its decision had followed a review of its European operations.  "We accept that this decision will mean that we risk losing high calibre staff, but by focusing on other studios that already have exciting new projects in development we believe we will be in a stronger position going forward and able to offer the best possible content of the highest quality for our consumers," it said in a statement.  "Where possible we will try to reallocate people onto other projects. If appropriate opportunities are not possible within the company, we will assist staff in any way we can, including speaking with local employers and with other development companies."  Evolution had specialised in racing games for Sony games consoles. Its first title was World Rally Championship, released in 2001, which was followed by several sequels.  Then in 2006, it launched the off-road racer franchise Motor Storm.  However, its last title - Driveclub - had a troubled birth.  The game - which was designed to let six players form a club and race rival teams via the internet - was originally supposed to be a launch title for the PlayStation 4 in 2013, but was repeatedly delayed.  When it did finally become available in October 2014, its computer servers struggled to meet demand and plans to offer a free cut-down version to PlayStation Plus subscribers had to be delayed further.  Since then, however, it has been improved and the news site Eurogamer described it as "one of the best racing games available". Last July, Evolution announced the game had surpassed more than two million sales.  Driveclub's community manager has issued a statement saying the title will "continue to thrive" under the guidance of Sony's other developers.  Its director also issued a statement of his own via Twitter.  "It truly has been an honour to work with such a talented, passionate and determined group of people," wrote Paul Rustchynsky.  "I hope you will all join me today in celebrating Evolution by picking up a pad, throwing on your favourite Evo game, and giving us a victory lap."  Sony's announcement came three weeks after Microsoft announced it was cancelling the release of Fable Legends, an action role-playing game, and was in discussions to close the Guilford-based studio behind it.  "I think it's coincidental that there have been announcements about both Evolution and Lionhead so close together," commented Rob Crossley, UK news editor of Gamespot.  "The games industry is in a growth period right now and there are lots of signs of positivity.  "But these are two studios that aren't succeeding as much as they needed to.  "You hear that some of the 'triple A' [big budget] games now sometimes have to sell above five million units to get into the black."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35875879	Pensioners: Are the untouchables still untouchable?	David Cameron has made a clear commitment to protect and reward Britain's pensioners for as long as he is prime minister. The "triple lock" on pensions, the winter fuel payment, free bus passes, TV licences, prescriptions and eye tests, all guaranteed "no question".  It's a promise that comes with a huge price tag, though. A hastily withdrawn official report from the Government Actuary's Department last year suggested the "triple lock" - raising the state pension annually by the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5% - has added £6bn extra a year to the benefits bill.  That is a massive additional sum - particularly at a time when the government is insisting the overall welfare budget be reduced by £12bn.  Laura Kuenssberg: No more welfare cuts, for now  Almost every attempt to find the savings within the benefits bill has ended in tears. Cuts to tax credits have been shelved, disability benefits are now protected and the new Work and Pensions Secretary, Stephen Crabb, has promised there are no further planned cuts to the welfare budget.  Even the chancellor's raid on housing associations and local authorities by cutting housing benefit has come back to haunt him, with the postponement of the policy in respect of supported housing projects.  The government has talked itself into a corner and inevitably, questions are being asked as to whether the prime minister's straight-to-camera promise not to touch pensioner entitlements can be sustained.  This afternoon in the House of Commons, Conservative MP Stewart Jackson said pensioner benefits needed to be reassessed. "It's wrong morally I believe to make large-scale transfer of wealth from the young to the old, and I think there has to be a consensus," he said.  Before his resignation, Iain Duncan Smith had argued that universal pensioner benefits should be scrapped in favour of a means-tested system. Winter fuel payments and other pensioner benefits cost close to £3bn a year and the Sun newspaper was among those campaigning to "ditch handouts to rich OAPs".  But Mr Cameron, aware of the political price paid by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg when he went back on his promise to oppose student fees, is adamant that his government will not break its pledge to Britain's pensioners.  This special protection means that, once housing costs are considered, median pensioner incomes are higher than non-pensioner incomes. While young people tightened their belts during the downturn, the over-65s were getting richer.  The result of that is that poverty among pensioners is now lower than among people of working age. It is quite a turnaround - in the 1960s, about 40% of pensioners were living in poverty, compared with less than 10% of under-65s.  The pensioner has become a totemic force in British politics. They vote and their numbers are growing. The over-65s have become almost untouchable.  As David Cameron puts it, "I want older people across this country to know this: for all the decades you've toiled, for the years you've done the right thing - for the rest of your days you will have dignity and security."  The political consequences of getting pensioner policies wrong can be highly damaging.  In 1999, New Labour made what Tony Blair regards as one of the greatest mistakes of his premiership when the basic state pension was increased by inflation - a "derisory" rise of just 75p a week.  It may have been a rise in line with the cost of living, but the government found itself attacked from all sides.  Many Labour supporters blamed Margaret Thatcher for breaking the link between pensions and earnings, and the idea that their own party should continue with the inflation link led to quite a few members sending cheques for 75p to Gordon Brown at the Treasury.  To add insult to injury, the department cashed them.  Labour did eventually restore the earnings link but the coalition went further, introducing the "triple lock".  So pensioners are a powerful lobby group, but the question of whether their level of protection is too great has burst out into the open.  A committee of MPs has launched an inquiry into "intergenerational fairness" - investigating the extent to which government policies, such as the "triple lock", are leading to inequity between the young and old.  "Is it fair and affordable to divert a large and growing sum of public expenditure towards pensioners - regardless of their circumstances - while mainly poor families with children face year-on-year restrictions on their income?" asks committee chair, the veteran Labour welfare reform campaigner Frank Field.  "Can the "triple lock" pension increase pledge be sustainable? Or are these policies necessary to guard against pensioner poverty?"  The committee points out that the group born in the middle of the baby boom (between 1956 and 1961) has been forecast to receive from the welfare state 118% of what they contribute, while recent research shows that younger people are on course to have less wealth at each point in their lives than earlier generations had acquired by the same age.  However, the basic state pension is still far from generous - the most you can currently get is £115.95 per week.  Many would argue that the reduction in pensioner poverty is a cause for celebration, not jealous sniping.  If David Cameron refuses to entertain any change of tack on the commitment to "triple lock" and other pensioner benefits while protecting other spending, the question remains: where is he going to save the missing billions?	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35868436	George Osborne: We listen and learn from mistakes	George Osborne has told MPs he was "sorry" Iain Duncan Smith resigned and was "proud" of their work together.  Defending his handling of the economy ahead of a vote to approve his Budget, the chancellor said Treasury talks with departments had often been "robust".  But where mistakes were made he was ready "to listen and learn", he added.  Labour said Mr Osborne would have to raid the welfare budget further or "ditch" his self-imposed cap on overall benefits spending.  Mr Osborne's Commons performance came after Mr Duncan Smith's post-Budget decision to quit, with a blast at "indefensible" changes to disability benefits.  Mr Osborne confirmed he had dropped planned cuts to Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) and said no further welfare savings were anticipated beyond the £12bn already approved by Parliament towards his target of balancing the books by 2020.  But he came under sustained pressure from Labour to explain how he will cover the £4.4bn gap in the Budget left by the rethink.  Former minister Yvette Cooper said Mr Osborne would either have to backtrack on ring fencing welfare or accept he would breach his self-imposed cap on welfare spending, the total limit on the amount of taxpayers' cash that goes on benefits.  "Either he has ripped up his own welfare cap and ditched another big plank of his Budget in just a few days," she said.  "Or he and the work and pensions secretary (Stephen Crabb) have used the most awful weasel words in Parliament and there are still more welfare cuts to come. Either this is chaos or it is a con."  The chancellor told MPs that the disability benefit cuts, likely to have affected up to 640,000 people, did not "command support".  Away from the sound and fury in the Commons this afternoon, and there has been a lot of it, did George Osborne gave even more of a hint that the government is likely to ditch or at least relax the restrictions it has placed on welfare?  Labour backbenchers managed to press him into almost repeating Stephen Crabb's statement a day earlier that the government won't introduce new extra cuts to welfare.  It looks like it will be rather hard for the government to keep its promise to keep welfare spending within its set limits, and the (almost) promise they made this afternoon.  It's clear from the Budget that the government is committed to meet its cap on welfare spending, a total limit on the amount of taxpayers' cash that goes on benefits, by 2020.  It's also clear the government intends to spell out how it will do that this autumn. But when you look at the numbers in the Office for Budget Responsibility's book, it says welfare spending is expected to be more than £3bn over the cap, in 2020.  So if the government really intends to hit the cap they will either have to find more welfare cuts after all, or relax the cap this autumn, or quietly ditch it altogether.  The Treasury and the Department for Work and Pensions are yet to answer this question. But it seems politically impossible to go back for more cuts, politically unlikely that Mr Osborne will ditch his beloved welfare cap, so now, more likely than not, that in the autumn the limit will have to be raised again.  But he said he was "proud" of the government's record, insisting that spending on disability benefits would still be higher in 2020 than it was now and 300,000 people with disabilities had found work in the past couple of years.  Praising Mr Duncan Smith, with whom he is reported to have had a history of disagreements, he said: "I'm sorry that my right honourable friend chose to leave the government and let me here in this House recognise his achievements in helping to make work pay, protecting the vulnerable and breaking the decades old cycle of welfare dependency."  But he rejected his former colleague's charge that the chancellor's fiscal targets risked dividing society and working-age benefit claimants were being unduly penalised by a "desperate search" for savings.  "There is not some inherent conflict between delivering social justice and the savings required to deliver sound public finances," he said. "There are one and same thing. Without some public finances there is no social justice."  It was clear that the chancellor was opting for spiritual healing rather than keyhole surgery.  His departed colleague Iain Duncan Smith was praised for having helped to create a fairer society.  The chancellor even dared to reclaim the mantra the former work and pensions secretary questioned in his resignation letter - "we are all in this together" he promised.  It would set the tone for the chancellor's statement, which was more often about the big picture on the economy rather than the fiscal detail.  In his resignation letter, Mr Duncan Smith said targeting disability benefits at the same time as cutting corporation and capital gains taxes flew in the face of the prime minister's and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  Conservative MPs noisily backed Mr Osborne during the debate although former chancellor Ken Clarke noted Mr Osborne had ruled out rises in income tax, VAT and national insurance and urged him to consider asking better-off pensioners to give up free bus passes and winter fuel allowances.  In response, Mr Osborne said people who had worked hard all their lives deserved a "decent, generous basic state pension and I am not going to take that away".  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell described his opposite number as a "political chancer" while Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said Mr Osborne's reputation was tarnished and he risked damaging the campaign to keep the UK in the EU.  As well as the welfare changes, Downing Street said ministers would also not seek to oppose amendments to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" and an increase in VAT on solar panels.	politics

The government's Housing and Planning Bill is running into deep trouble, with Labour's chief whip, Lord Bassam, promising anything between eight and a dozen significant defeats for ministers, when report stage consideration starts, after Easter.  If he can marshal a combination of Labour and Lib Dem peers, plus crossbenchers and Tory rebels, the bill could be gutted of some of its most controversial sections. Both Labour and the Lib Dems have become adept at getting key crossbenchers to lead the charge, so watch out, in particular for amendments in the name of Lord Kerslake, a former Permanent Secretary in the Department of Communities and Local Government, and housing expert Lord Best.  The big amendments may thud down onto the table at the end of this week, or perhaps during the second week of the Easter break - and may be countered, probably in the second week of that break, by government amendments, offering concessions to head off defeat.  Conservative sources say there is some wiggle room.  Unusually, Labour today published a shopping list of possible changes. They cover all the major elements of the bill: giving councils control over the numbers and tenure type of starter homes; requiring a "one built for one sold" rule, if social housing tenants are given the right to buy; adding safeguards on secure tenancies; imposing new duties on fitness for human habitation and electrical safety on landlords, and ensuring the proposed changes to the planning system don't give developers a free hand.  It's quite a list, but as Labour made clear today, they regard this bill as a target rich environment, in which a strong coalition of peers can be mobilised against many key provisions.  The battles will be fought out over a five day report stage, which is expected to start immediately after peers return from their Easter break - with the fifth and final day of report on Monday 25 April.  That puts the third reading in May, leaving limited time for prolonged parliamentary ping-pong between Lords and Commons, and with the clock ticking toward the end of the Parliamentary session, the Lords will enjoy considerable leverage and ministers will face enormous pressure to make concessions, or risk losing their bill altogether.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35875210	Did George Osborne do enough to heal Tory wounds?	With open wounds in his party, a gap in his finances and questions over his competence the chancellor had much to try to heal.  He was returning to the chamber less than a week after announcing his Budget, with one of its measures already dead and others surviving only after life support.  Had George Osborne himself been left fatally weakened by Iain Duncan Smith's resignation?  Certainly his authority was in question.  Mr Osborne's critics wanted to know how he was going to fill a £4.4bn "black hole" left by the U-turn over disability payments.  Labour had pointed to another gap - left by a man they said was too "scared" to answer their urgent Commons question over all of this on Monday.  But now here he was at the dispatch box - a chancellor opening the final day of a Budget debate, something that he pointed out had not happened in 20 years.  As he got to his feet the body language from MPs behind him seemed positive; there was the sound of rousing support as he began to speak.  The mood in the chamber immediately calmed as the chancellor began by paying tribute to the victims of the tragic events in Belgium.  It was a reminder, said Mr Osborne, of "what a precious thing our democracy is".  Today's Budget debate was part of that democratic process, he said, before a nod of euphemism to the significant problems he had been having.  "I think it's fair to say that we've had a livelier debate about this Budget than many."  So what of his solutions? It was clear that the chancellor was opting for spiritual healing rather than keyhole surgery.  His departed colleague Mr Duncan Smith was praised for having helped to create a fairer society.  The chancellor even dared to reclaim the mantra the former work and pensions secretary questioned in his resignation letter - "we are all in this together" he promised.  It would set the tone for the chancellor's statement, which was more often about the big picture on the economy rather than the fiscal detail.  "Without sound public finances there is no social justice," he said.  The cost of the disability payments U-turn could be "absorbed", he declared.  But it was far from an answer for Labour MPs, who punctuated the chancellor's statement with critical interruptions.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Osborne's behaviour called into question his fitness for the office he holds.  "What we've seen is not the actions of a chancellor... but the grubby incompetent manipulations of a political chancer," he said.  Mr Osborne got what he predicted - a lively debate on the budget; healing the problems it leaves him may take some time longer.	politics

It is not clear when this will come into effect.  Earlier this month WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, also announced that it would only continue to support Blackberry's Android-powered Priv handset.  Whatsapp support for Blackberry's own operating system will end at the end of 2016, the firm said.  "We fought back to work with WhatsApp and Facebook to change their minds, but at this time, their decision stands," wrote Lou Gazzola, who works in developer relations at Blackberry, in a blog post.  "We have worked hard to ensure our end users have the best experience in light of this decision, and are continuing to search for alternate solutions."  Mr Gazzola urged supporters to take to social media using the hashtag #ILoveBB10Apps.  "I use BB10 because I wanted an alternative to Android and iOS devices, don't stop offering people an alternative choice! #ILoveBB10Apps" tweeted Ed Hale.  Facebook has been contacted for comment.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35869921	Conservatives propose overhaul of local party associations	The Conservatives have put forward plans to change the structure of local party associations and the way that election candidates are chosen.  The party wants to pilot associations spanning more than one constituency and also centralise certain membership functions and create a single candidate list for UK and European elections.  Chair Lord Feldman said it would help channel resources into campaigning.  It follows a review launched in the wake of last year's election victory.  Despite the Conservatives winning their first majority since 1992, there were concerns that it struggled to match Labour's "ground campaign" in many parts of the country, in terms of mobilising activists to canvass and help get out the vote.  The party is now proposing a series of changes to how voluntary parties are structured at a local level which it says will give it a "stronger platform" from which to fight the next election.  It wants to encourage some local associations, which vary considerably in size, to combine to form multi-constituency organisations in the hope of boosting their financial strength and improving their capabilities.  Party members in those areas will be asked to vote on the plans while associations with more than 100 members and a "fully operational structure" will be able to opt out if a majority of members vote against.  Other changes would see constituency associations offer different levels of membership, with associated benefits, and for administration of membership to be centralised - although parties will be still be responsible for recruiting members locally.  The review panel has recommended an outreach programme to widen the pool of candidates for future UK and European elections amid criticism the party remains too middle class and, despite recent progress, has too few female MPs and that ethnic minorities continue to be under-represented in the parliamentary party.  Lord Feldman, a close ally of David Cameron, said the changes - which must be approved by the party's National Convention at its autumn conference - showed the party was "far from complacent" despite last year's victory.  "To continue to win elections, with the buy-in and support of our members, we need to adapt," he said.  "Currently, our associations spend less than a third of their total income on campaigning - that's not the right allocation of resources if we are going to run a really dynamic operation on the ground."	politics

Mr Grove was the third employee at Intel and one of the leaders of its engineering team.  He helped the company move from making memory chips to processors, a decision that let to its dominance in the supply of chips powering PCs.  He served as chief executive of Intel from 1987 to 1998 and then became chairman of its board until 2005.  Born Andras Grof in Budapest, Hungary, he emigrated to the US in 1956 aged 20 after living through Nazi persecution, a Soviet siege, repression under different Communist regimes and the crushing of a popular uprising.  In the US, he taught himself English at the same time as he studied chemical engineering, earning a doctorate in the subject in 1963.  Straight after, he joined Fairchild Semiconductor and formed friendships with Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce.  Mr Grove joined the pair in 1968 when they left Fairchild to set up Intel, becoming the third employee at the fledgling semiconductor maker.  Mr Grove was director of engineering at Intel, initially overseeing its production of memory chips.  He was instrumental in changing this manufacturing focus in the late 1970s in response to growing competition and ongoing production problems.  He switched the company to making processors for the first microcomputers and negotiated with IBM to ensure it used only Intel chips in its personal computers.  This helped establish the x86 line of processors that are synonymous with the rise of the PC.  This strategy shift helped Intel's revenues rise from $1.9bn (£1.33bn) to more than $26bn.  Mr Moore was also known for his painstaking management style, which helped to establish the internal culture of Intel.  "He combined the analytic approach of a scientist with an ability to engage others in honest and deep conversation, which sustained Intel's success over a period that saw the rise of the personal computer, the internet and Silicon Valley," said Intel chairman Andy Bryant in a statement.  Intel was "deeply saddened" by Mr Grove's passing, said current chief executive Bryan Krzanich.  Mr Grove stepped down from his role as chief executive in 1998 as he was being treated for prostate cancer. He remained as Intel's chairman until 2005.  Intel has not given any details of what brought about his death. However, it is known that Mr Grove was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2000.  Mr Grove is survived by his wife, Eva, to whom he was married for 58 years, their two children and eight grandchildren.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35863861	Apple's FBI row is only just beginning	You could forgive Apple's legal team for coming across a little exasperated on Monday evening.  Just hours before its day in court - in the town of Riverside, California - the most unexpected twist yet: the trial had been postponed, perhaps indefinitely.  The FBI said it had, "this past weekend", been shown a way to unlock the iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook.  The FBI has until 5 April to let the court know how it gets on. If the method doesn't work, and the phone is still locked, we'll probably return to Riverside for the hearing.  If it is successful - then, well, who knows what will happen? Uncharted waters. The case, already the most fascinating tech legal tussle for years, enters murky territory.  And here's why. Let's say, for arguments sake, that the FBI does indeed have a new, credible method of getting into the iPhone.  Where on Earth did it come from?  Apple's bewilderment is understandable given that, right up until the final hour, the FBI had insisted it had exhausted every possible route. It told Congress as much.  In a hearing earlier this month, FBI director James Comey stood firm as Congressman Darrell Issa gave him a dramatic dressing down for not pursuing a technique known as mirroring - essentially, and I'm simplifying here, duplicating the phone so repeated attempts can be made to unlock it without disturbing the original.  Mr Comey said he'd look into it - though that was 20 days ago.  Also during that congressional hearing, Mr Issa pressed Mr Comey on whether he had asked the National Security Agency (NSA) for its help.  In response, Mr Comey, making reference to the particular model of iPhone and the software contained on it, said: "We have engaged all parts of the US government to see does anybody have a way, short of asking Apple to do it, with a 5C running iOS 9 - to do this, and we do not."  Had Tuesday's hearing gone ahead, we were expecting to hear the witness testimony of Stacey Perino, an FBI electronics engineer, and Christopher Pluhar, a computer forensics professor from California State University.  Both were due to underline that Apple, and only Apple, would be able to break into the phone.  Prof Pluhar, who is a supervisory agent for the FBI, had in the past said he had been "unable to identify any other methods feasible for gaining access to the currently inaccessible data stored within the subject device".  But we're being told to put all that aside for a moment because the FBI has said it is "cautiously optimistic" a new method suggested by an as-yet unknown "outside party" could solve all its problems, allowing investigators access to the iPhone without Apple's help.  Apple's legal team has said it has no idea what that vulnerability could be - but it, of course, didn't rule out the possibility it existed.  After all, it's software - and no piece of software ever written has even been watertight.  Every time you update your phone, computer, tablet, it's often to plug a few new security holes.  So if, come 5 April, the FBI says it no longer needs Apple's help, it would mean the US government has knowledge of a cybersecurity vulnerability that potentially affects each and every iPhone out there.  Now, typically when something like this is discovered, and it happens fairly often, security researchers engage the company affected in a process called "responsible disclosure".  They tell the company privately about the flaw, and then agree how to make the issue public.  When the responsible disclosure system works, the problem is fixed before the public finds out.  It makes devices safer, and shares the discovery among everyone involved in computer security.  So keen are companies to encourage this kind of approach that many offer "bug bounties" - cash prizes for people who report new critical bugs.  Hackers that operate in this way are known as "white hat". The good guys.  The alternative - black hat - is to not tell the company about a flaw and instead sell the vulnerability on the black market to any buyer, be it for secret, state-sponsored activity, or simply for criminal means.  If the method proposed by the "outside party" works, here's the question: will the FBI engage in responsible disclosure with Apple after it has accessed the iPhone used by Farook?  If it does, Apple will surely seek to fix the flaw immediately, putting us back to square one when the inevitable next case comes around.  But if the FBI doesn't share the method, what will that do to the reputation of Apple's products if it's known the US government is openly in possession of a security flaw of this magnitude?

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35863859	Can the Micro Bit inspire a million?	It was last May that the BBC unveiled an ambitious plan to give a million schoolchildren a tiny device designed to inspire them to get coding. Now, after a few bumps in the road, the Micro Bits are finally ending up in the hands of children.  The tiny device can be plugged into a computer and programmed to do all sorts of cool stuff, and the ear Seven pupils across the UK are being told it is theirs to take home.  Some, who have had early access to the Micro Bit, have come up with amazing projects - like the Yorkshire school that sent one up 32km (20 miles) on a balloon bringing back pictures of its journey to the fringes of space.  But, amid all the excitement from the young people getting a new toy, this is where the serious stuff starts. Big claims have been made for how this project can change the way children learn about and engage with technology. Now, it's up to teachers to make that happen.  I've been talking to two people with different perspectives on the Micro Bit. Steve Hodges is a Microsoft engineer who was closely involved in the design of the device and Drew Buddie is head of computing at a girls' school and chairman of NAACE, an educational technology association.  Steve told me that his whole career in computing had started as a result of the BBC Micro in the 1980s.  "I begged my parents to buy me one for home. I told them I would never ask for anything again if they bought me a BBC Micro!" he recalls.  His hope is that the Micro Bit will prove similarly inspiring.  Unlike his generation, today's children already have access to a variety of computers, so the aims are different.  "We built a small, low-power 'embedded' device, which actually needs a regular computer to program it. In a world of wearable devices, connected gadgets and the 'internet of things' the Micro Bit is both relevant and yet unusual - just like the BBC Micro was 35 years ago," he says.  Drew is very enthusiastic about the aims of the Micro Bit, and he too harks back to his childhood.  "For those of us who were around for the BBC Micro, we feel that we are on the very cusp of a renaissance of that era," he says.  But the repeated delays in rolling out the device to schools have dismayed him.  Teachers have had Micro Bits for some weeks but they are being delivered to children just as the term ends.  "There seems to be a perception at the BBC that teachers were ready to drop everything to use these devices as soon as they became available," Drew says. He explains that it's now too late in the year for many to adapt their lesson plans.  The delays are understandable - bringing together a consortium of companies to produce something that had to be exciting, educational and safe was always going to be a challenge. One difficulty came when the team realised that the small watch battery in the original version could be a choke hazard for small brothers and sisters when the device was taken home.  "The real challenge was the scale of the project," says Steve Hodges.  Usually a company will start out making a few thousand of a new device.  "But we knew that we would be manufacturing one million devices from day one so we needed to plan for every eventuality we could think of to make the device as feature-rich, safe and robust as we could," he explains.  I asked Steve whether it might not have been better to give children a Raspberry Pi, the barebones computer that has already been a big hit.  He sees the two devices being used in tandem but says the Micro Bit is designed to be different, and to attract "students who enjoy a more hands-on, tactile learning style and who would otherwise find coding less appealing".  One key feature of the Micro Bits is that they belong not to the schools or the teachers but to the children. It seems, however, that some teachers don't buy into that idea.  Drew says significant numbers "seem to be suggesting that they will try to hold on to the devices in schools by discouraging the students from taking them home".  But he says that won't happen at his school.  "My attitude is that I'm going to give them to the girls because they belong to them," he states.  He remains enthusiastic about starting some projects and thinks his students will be keen to use their Micro Bits to make some wearable technology. But he says some of the early impetus has been lost and, rather than being incorporated into lessons, the Micro Bit will be taught in lunchtimes and after-school clubs.  The BBC project is focused on schoolchildren who entered Year 7 last September. There is still time for them to get inspired, but it now looks as though it will be in Year 8 that they may really get to grips with their Micro Bits and learn most from them.  So, what happens to those who enter Year 7 this coming September?  There is talk of turning the Micro Bit into a commercial product and, given the level of interest in it, that must be a distinct possibility. Then schools would have to decide whether to buy more of the devices.  The BBC Micro made a big impact in schools and beyond throughout the 1980s, inspiring a generation of computing and gaming entrepreneurs.  It is a big act to follow, but let's hope the Micro Bit can now begin to open a new generation's eyes to the creative potential of computing.  Read about seven projects already created with the Micro Bit  Rory will be doing a live Q&A about the Micro Bit on the BBC Facebook page shortly after 1330GMT.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35824446	Seven outstanding Micro Bit projects	The Micro Bit - a small computer designed to power internet-connected projects - is being handed out to thousands of British school children.  The device has been made for Year Sevens (11-to-12-year-olds) and equivalents as part of an initiative spearheaded by the BBC.  Microsoft, Samsung, ARM and several other organisations that teach coding to youngsters are also involved.  The roll-out is happening later in the school year than originally planned.  But there is undoubtedly pent-up enthusiasm for the computer.  Unlike other budget computers - such as the Raspberry Pi - the machine is meant to be programmed via the web, rather than being connected to a keyboard and screen of its own.  So, what can it do?  As a standalone device it can be made to flash its LEDs in sequence and take readings from several built-in sensors, but when added to other hardware the possibilities are limitless.  Below are seven projects by some of those who got their hands on the tech early.  The initial batch of Micro Bits were very limited in number. But that didn't stop one school launching their copy more than 32km (20 miles) into the air.  One of the pupils at Rishworth School in West Yorkshire wrote a program that used a heat sensor to log changes in temperature and show the current reading on the computer's LEDs. Her classmates then attached the kit to a helium balloon and let it fly upwards.  "Her code measured the temperature in the stratosphere, which is pretty awesome," recalled the teacher in charge, Peter Bell.  "The kids were absolutely buzzing about the whole project."  But he added that anyone thinking of repeating the initiative should not do so lightly.  "We had to get civil aviation authority approval and were given a two-hour window to launch," he explained.  "And on its descent, it initially fell for 14 seconds travelling at up to 180mph [290km/h].  "At one point National Air Traffic Services apparently rerouted all the aircraft around Nottingham because there was essentially a missile travelling towards the airspace, but the parachute deployed when it got to an atmosphere where enough air was hitting it."  The equipment was later recovered from a farmer's field.  Micro Bits are by design small enough to fit inside a child's pocket. So, it seems a bit obtuse to try and turn them into a giant display board.  Even so, Kitronik - an electronics parts supplier involved in the Micro Bit initiative - posed itself the challenge using 1,009 prototypes it had been given access to.  The company's director used Microsoft's Touch Develop web interface to write three programs:  "I realised early on that the big challenge on this project wasn't going to be writing the three different versions of code - though this did take a number of days - but was going to be to assemble the display," recalled Geoff Hampson.  "Which is why we called on a team of volunteers to help wire it all up."  A total of 230m (755ft) of wiring and 5,000 bolts were required to complete the project, which was unveiled at the Bett tech show in January.  Six students from London's Highgate School came up with the idea of using the Micro Bit to help people with autism recognise other people's emotional states, as part of a one-day coding challenge earlier this year.  People with the condition can struggle to read expressions and respond appropriately as a result of the disability.  The team coded the computer so that a user could scroll through a series of graphics, shown via the LEDs, of faces presenting different moods.  When they found a match they could press another button to make the LEDs state what the image represented - for example "happy", "sad" or "angry".  "I think it was fantastic for these students to tackle a potentially difficult and complex issue such as disability and autism," said Holly Margerison from the Institution of Engineering and Technology, which organised the Faraday Projects event.  "I also think this could be a great partnership activity, so students with and without autism could [further] work together on this product.  "One thing which strikes me is that the students clearly understand the place of coding in the world and understand the ways in which it can enhance and improve their lives."  The chip creator - whose processor architecture is used by the mini-computer - got one of its team to juggle three of the devices and streamed data from their acceleration sensors to the internet via a Bluetooth link.  To do so, they made use of Google's new Eddystone communication protocol and then tracked the readings - recorded at a rate of 200 times a second - via a web-based application. The information was used to create a graph tracking the rate that each of the Micro Bits sped up and slowed down.  "We can detect in a program run on the Micro Bit when it is falling, and that means we can know how long it is falling for and how high we threw it," explained Jonny Austin, one of the engineers involved.  "So, if I am juggling very unevenly you might see that every third throw I actually don't throw one of the Micro Bits nearly as high, and that would be represented by a much flatter peak on the graph."  In theory, he added, it should be possible to spot patterns that could help a juggler-in-training identify problems with their technique.  Pupils at Eastlea Community School in London came up with the idea of using a Micro Bit to keep a small aircraft on track as it headed toward the North Pole.  The computer was programmed to trigger one of two motors whenever the vehicle drifted off course to steer it back to its destination.  "The students came up with a working proof-of-concept but the gondola that they made was a little bit too weighty," said their teacher Steve Richards.  "Air regulations would have also been a problem."  But, he added, the class took these issues in their stride and are now developing a Micro Bit-steered paddle steamer boat that will make use of solar and wind energy.  Mr Richards has previously taught classes using another British low-cost computer - the Raspberry Pi - but says he believes the Micro Bit is better suited for younger age groups.  "It's been designed at a lower level that allows children to understand more quickly the concepts that you are trying to get across," he explained.  "With the Raspberry Pi there are a lot of things that don't make immediate sense. So, I think the Micro Bit will make a great stepping stone that engages younger children before they want to do more serious projects that would require something like the Pi."  The Bloodhound Project - an effort to set a new land speed record of more than 1,000mph (1,609km/h) - has its own Micro Bit spin-off.  Since the start of January, hundreds of children have been invited to carve their own model cars out of foam and blast them along a track using black-powder rockets fitted to their rears.  The computers are slotted inside to measure the rocket cars' fastest speeds, average speeds and changes in thrust. The children then use the feedback to improve their designs.  "This is something that teachers don't normally want to do because there is a lot of risk assessment involved," said Graeme Lawrie, one of the organisers and director of innovation at Sevenoaks school in Kent.  "But these kind of wow factors are few and far between, and it provides the children with inspiration and enthusiasm for Stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) subjects."  As if that wasn't enough incentive to take part, the teams that make the fastest models are being promised a chance to have their names added to the fin of the actual Bloodhound supersonic car.  Not all the early Micro Bit projects were targeted at children or involved coding.  Dr Rebecca Fiebrink got hold of a device to use as part of her research into computer music at Goldsmiths, University of London.  The lecturer used a program called Wekinator, which teaches a computer to recognise certain inputs and map them to different sounds.  By connecting up a Micro Bit she was able to create music by twisting, tilting and drawing shapes in front of her with the mini-computer.  "One example I made was a simple drum machine that I control using tilts," she told the BBC.  "I can also use it to recognise gestures that I draw in the air and to create more experimental sounds.  "It's a really exciting time right now because of the growing availability of relatively cheap-to-use sensing platforms, and the Micro Bit is a great way to get started building things."  BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones will be doing a live Q&A about the Micro Bit on the BBC Facebook page shortly after 1330GMT.	tech

Everyone believes the same things they did this time last week, they explained, so why has so much changed?  A cabinet minister has resigned, Conservatives have spent much of the last couple of days taking lumps out of each other in public, and the government has, to use the awful but-oh-so-handy jargon, carried out a screaming U-turn on its Budget.  Late this afternoon, the new secretary of state for work and pensions Stephen Crabb then appeared to promise a new policy altogether - not just ditching the planned changes to Personal Independence Payments that have caused so much trouble, but a commitment from the government not to carry out any further raids on the welfare budget. In other words, a promise of no more benefit cuts, for now.  Mr Crabb provided the usual Westminster wriggle room - no "planned" extra cuts - rather than ruling out taking the axe to the benefits budget ever, ever again.  But couple that with his comments in the Commons - "behind every statistic is a human being and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that" - and it seems the new secretary of state was displaying just as much sympathy with his predecessor's views as with the chancellor or the prime minister.  I'm told the plan to make that announcement was Mr Crabb's but the language was agreed by Downing Street and Number 11. The irony was perhaps that Iain Duncan Smith was nowhere to be seen in Westminster, absent for the announcement he might have longed to make himself  It seems his successor at least has some sympathy with IDS's view that the cuts to welfare have gone far enough.  P.S. It's worth remembering of course that the government has already set in train £12bn of cuts to welfare - very significant cuts, too.  P.P.S. It's also worth noting that David Cameron gave his backing very publicly to George Osborne today. Tomorrow, the chancellor has to front up this mess in the Commons himself.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35863776	Stephen Crabb: 'No further plans' for welfare cuts	Ministers have said say they will not target other benefits to pay for abandoning cuts to disability payments.  Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb made the pledge in his first speech since replacing Iain Duncan Smith, who quit as discord broke out in the Tory party over the cuts.  Earlier, the PM defended Chancellor George Osborne, whose Budget is missing £4.4bn since the cuts were dropped.  Labour said Mr Osborne should resign and the Budget should be withdrawn.  Both David Cameron and Mr Crabb praised Mr Duncan Smith, who has said the government risked dividing society with politically-motivated spending cuts.  The new work and pensions secretary confirmed the changes to Personal Independence Payments had been cancelled and told MPs: "After discussing this issue over the weekend with the prime minister and the chancellor we have no further plans to make welfare savings beyond the very substantial savings legislated for by Parliament two weeks ago."  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government could technically bring forward cuts at a later date but politically this now looked very difficult.  A Downing Street spokesman said the government would still deliver on its commitment to save £12bn from welfare by the end of the Parliament in 2020.  Mr Crabb also said the government welfare cap, branded "arbitrary" by Mr Duncan Smith, had "strengthened accountability" and its level would be reviewed in the Autumn Statement later this year.  "I am absolutely clear that a compassionate and fair welfare system should not be just about the numbers," he added.  "Behind every statistic there is a human being, and perhaps sometimes in government we forget that."  The Conservative leadership has been under fire - including from some of its own backbenchers - over the cuts to disability payments, which came at the same time as tax cuts for higher earners.  Mr Duncan Smith - who resigned on Friday - said this flew in the face of Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne's oft-repeated claim that "we are all in this together".  London mayor Boris Johnson welcomed the fact that the cuts had been shelved but he said he rejected "totally and utterly" claims that the government was pursuing divisive policies.  Speaking to ITV's The Agenda, he said Mr Duncan Smith should have "stayed and fought his point of view" from within cabinet, saying his walkout was "a storm in a teacup".  Mr Cameron addressed Mr Duncan Smith's attack during a statement about the European Council in the Commons on Monday afternoon.  He stressed to MPs that the Conservatives remained a "modern, compassionate, one nation" party under his leadership.  He listed policies aimed at low-earners including the National Living Wage and rebuilding "sink estates", adding: "None of this would be possible if it wasn't for the actions of this government and the work of the chancellor in turning our economy around."  The changes to Personal Independence Payments which prompted his resignation have now been shelved, and ministers plan to say how the planned £4bn savings will be found at the Autumn Statement later in the year.  Responding to Mr Cameron's statement, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn criticised Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber and said the U-turn on disability benefits had created an "enormous hole" in the Budget, adding that the package had "inequality at its core".  He did not mention Mr Duncan Smith's resignation or his parting shot at the government.  When Labour MP Liz Kendall did put Mr Duncan Smith's criticism to the PM, Mr Cameron said he was sad at his colleague's resignation, adding: "But I can guarantee that work of being a compassionate Conservative government will continue."  The changes to the Budget were the subject of an urgent question from Labour before Mr Cameron's statement.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell called on Mr Osborne to resign following Mr Duncan Smith's resignation and the furore over the PIP cuts, but Downing Street says the chancellor has the full confidence of the prime minister.  Mr McDonnell said Mr Osborne's absence from the Commons chamber "insults this House" and that Treasury Minister David Gauke had been left to "defend the indefensible".  He added: "This is no way to deliver a Budget and no way to manage an economy."  Mr Gauke said the chancellor would be in the chamber for Tuesday's Budget debate, and said Labour was not in a position to comment on "black holes" in budgets.  He said spending on Personal Independence Payments was up by £3bn since 2010, adding that the Budget "closes the gap between rich and poor and North and South".  As well as the welfare changes, Downing Street says ministers will not seek to oppose amendments to scrap the so-called "tampon tax" and an increase in VAT on solar panels.	politics

An amendment to the Immigration Bill to let the children come to Britain was adopted by 306 votes to 204 - a majority of 102.  Labour's Lord Dubs, who came to the UK as a child refugee, said it would save children from exploitation and abuse.  But the government said the amendment would not target those most in need.  Home Office minister Lord Bates said the government was concentrating its efforts on helping Syrian refugees before they reach Europe and insisted no other country was doing more than the UK.  Campaigners, including charity Save the Children, have been calling for the government to accept 3,000 children from Europe into the UK, but ministers have warned that it could spur more refugees to risk "lethal" journeys.  Ministers may seek to overturn the defeat - the latest in a string of votes the government has lost in the Lords this Parliament - when the bill returns to the Commons.  Arguing for the UK to take in 3,000 unaccompanied child refugees, Lord Dubs said it would protect children from exploitation, people trafficking and abuse.  The peer - who arrived in the UK as a refugee on the Kindertransport which helped children escape from the Nazis during World War Two - said the UK needed to show the same compassion.  "I would like other children who are in a desperate situation to be offered safety in this country and be given the same opportunities that I had," he told peers.  His amendment - which would require ministers to allow the children to come to the UK as soon as possible after the bill became law - attracted cross-party support.  "We could do it in 1930s, why can't we do it now?" said crossbench peer Baroness Neuberger, while fellow crossbencher Lord Alton of Liverpool warned that refusing to help the children would leave a "lasting stain" on Britain's reputation.  "This is a small, but beautiful thing that we can do," added the Bishop of Chelmsford, the Rt Rev Stephen Cottrell.  Meanwhile, a call to exclude children above the age of 12 from the scheme came from former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson of Blaby.  Home Office minister Lord Bates said on behalf of the government: "We have a principled objection. That the people most at risk are in the region."  "I question whether it (the amendment) identifies, or provides help, for the right people. We believe we should not be doing anything that encourages one child to make that perilous journey," he added.  Lord Bates said 51% of the 1,000 Syrian refugees resettled in the UK - as part of the government's pledge to take in 20,000 by 2020 - had been children.  He also said there was a shortage of foster carers and that it was hard to place refugee families with local authorities.  But the government's argument was not supported by the majority of the House, which voted by a margin of 102 to accept the amendment.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35843222	YouTube channel Trollstation 'shocked' by jail term	YouTube channel Trollstation has vowed to continue making films despite a team member being jailed for nine months.  The London-based channel, with 684,000 subscribers, has built a reputation for filming staged pranks around the city.  Danh Van Le, known as Digi Dan, and a 15-year-old boy were charged with making a bomb hoax with intent.  Van Le was given a 24-week sentence, with an additional 12 weeks for threatening behaviour during other pranks staged at two art galleries.  He admitted to both incidents and was also given a £100 fine while his accomplice, who cannot be named, was given a 12-month intense referral order.  The pair had a suitcase containing a ticking clock which they showed to members of the public before running off.  Trollstation said it was making a tribute to US schoolboy Ahmed Mohamed, who was arrested after taking a home-made clock into the classroom to show his teachers.  "We were shocked that Danh was charged with it," spokesman Light told the BBC. "Our aim was never to get away with breaking the law. I'm sure Danh regrets ending up in prison but he never meant for anything like this to happen.  "Being arrested wasn't that much of a big deal - when they [the police] found out it wasn't serious, that there was no threat, the fact that they wanted to pursue it surprised us," he added.  The team usually alerts the police via the non-emergency number before stunts take place, he added - but he wasn't sure whether that had happened on the day of the bomb hoax.  "We are at the moment facing very high risks in London of terrorism," said Ken Marsh, head of the Metropolitan Police Federation, earlier this year.  "If my firearms officers are confronted with someone who they think has got a firearm and has discharged it and that person doesn't respond correctly, ultimately they could be shot."  Trollstation describes itself as a channel "specialising in bizarre and often surreal pranks performed on unwitting members of the public".  It adds that its material is "intentionally provocative and controversial with the aim to get reactions from the general public in the name of comedic satire".  Its most popular videos include staged scenes of a young woman getting her period in public and the Queen's Guards having a fight.  Light said they feel the police have made an example of them. "They are sending out a message," he said.  The station consists of eight people in their early 20s.  "It's just a group of friends trying to get out of working 9-5 in retail," he added.  The group is currently crowdfunding to go on tour.	tech

The iPhone SE has the same processing and graphics performance of the larger Apple 6S, the firm said, and can capture 4K video.  The device will start at $399/$499 (£277/£346) and will be available in 110 countries by the end of May, Apple confirmed.  It is the "most affordable price ever" for a brand new handset, Apple added.  Apple said it sold 30 million four-inch handsets last year.  Apple's sales have slowed in recent months but so has the smartphone market in general, with some analysts predicting up to a 15% decline in shipments in the first quarter of 2016.  The firm also showed off a recycling robot called Liam which can strip down old iPhones into their components for reuse.  The Apple Watch is to come down in price to $299 (£207) from its launch price of $349, chief executive Tim Cook announced.  Mr Cook kicked off the event with a few words about Apple's dispute with the FBI over the unlocking of the iPhone which belonged to the San Bernadino gunman.  The firm has so far refused a court order to assist the Feds with accessing the data stored on the handset.  "We did not expect to be in this position, at odds with our own government," he said.  "We believe strongly we have a responsibility to help you protect your data... And your privacy.  "We will not shrink from this responsibility," he added.	tech

It comes after Labour peer Lord Levy threatened to quit the party unless Mr Corbyn sent a "clear message" that it would not allow anti-Semitism.  Mr Corbyn said he had always condemned all forms of racism and any complaints of anti-Semitism in the party would be properly investigated.  Labour has been hit by several claims of anti-Semitism recently.  Last week, party member Vicki Kirby was suspended for a second time over anti-Semitic tweets. A Labour spokeswoman said Ms Kirby, vice chair of the Woking constituency party, was being investigated.  Allegations relating to Oxford University Labour Club are also being investigated.  Mr Corbyn told Sky News: "The idea that somehow or other there is a tolerance of any form of racism is wholly and totally fallacious."  He said he was "disappointed" at the comments made by Lord Levy, who on Sunday said "it is now up to the leadership to make sure that there is a clear and unequivocal message out there that anti-Semitism in any form will not be tolerated".  Lord Levy had said: "If they don't make that clear then I will start to question myself and actually question my being a Labour peer and a proud member of the Labour party."  But Mr Corbyn said the peer "clearly hasn't been listening to the seven times since I became leader I have absolutely condemned anti-Semitism, I have condemned Islamophobia, I have condemned any form of racism anywhere within our society".  "It is absolutely something I totally, passionately believe in," he added and said his views were understood throughout the party.  The Labour leader added: "We do take action in the very, very, very small number of cases where anything happens and if we hear any allegations they are properly and thoroughly investigated."  Ms Kirby was first suspended in 2014 for making anti-Semitic comments but later reinstated. She was forced to stand down as an election candidate after tweets including one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God".  The Parliamentary Labour Party is also carrying out an investigation into allegations of anti-Semitism in the Oxford University Labour Club after it voted to support Israel Apartheid Week.  Oxford University Labour Club has said previously in a statement: "We are horrified at and whole-heartedly condemn anti-Semitic behaviour in all its forms."	politics

Affected customers will no longer be able to access new books from the Kindle Store, or sync with the Cloud, unless they manually download the update via USB.  However, a message being displayed on the devices will not make that clear.  It will only prompt users to restart their Kindles.  On its website, Amazon urged owners of the original 2012 Kindle Paperwhite and older devices to install the update.  It said: "If you do not update your device by March 22, 2016, you will receive the following message on your device: Your Kindle is unable to connect at this time.  "Please make sure you are within wireless range and try again. If the problem persists, please restart your Kindle from the Menu in Settings and try again."  The only way the solve the problem, however, will be to plug the device into a computer and download the relevant update from the Amazon website.  Amazon said that to install the update before 22 March, users should go to the Kindle home screen, choose Menu and select "Sync and Check for Items".  The device will then update when asleep.  According to the Kindleworld blog, the update will not affect a user's reading experience.  However, it said, a second update has been released which modifies the interface of more recent Kindles.  "Some [users] are not enthralled with the new interface because it includes recommended books," iKindleworld said.  "Some of us have always turned off the option to see Amazon recommendations, as we just want to see the books we bought and prefer to go to the Amazon pages if we want recommendations."  But users who do not want book recommendations can turn them off in their device settings by following instructions set out in an Amazon forum.	tech

The government was facing a rebellion from Eurosceptic MPs over the 5% VAT rate on women's sanitary products.  It is at the lowest rate allowed by EU law but rebels unhappy with EU say over tax rates were set to join forces with Labour to insist on VAT being removed.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was "another Labour victory" on the Budget.  The government has also conceded ground over the issue of VAT on solar panels and other domestic energy saving and insulation products, amid a threatened Conservative rebellion over a potential tax rise.  VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products - but more than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  In Wednesday's Budget, Mr Osborne said he recognised public feelings about the issue and said the EU had agreed to give the UK the leeway under EU law to set a zero rate.  Hailing what he said was a tax concession from Brussels that "no British government has even tried to achieve", he pledged to spend the proceeds of the tax on women's charities.  The government has now confirmed it will not oppose a Labour amendment to the Finance Bill calling for a zero rate of VAT. A number of Conservative MPs had threatened to vote with Labour on Tuesday to highlight the role of Brussels in setting VAT rates.  Some of those say they still intend to do so, arguing they think implementation of the reduced VAT rate will be delayed while all other 27 EU countries agree to the changes.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who tabled the amendment, welcomed the news. She tweeted: "Wow, thank you. Happy being the MP for Dewsbury." Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn described it as "another Labour victory".  At last week's European Council summit in Brussels, the 28 leaders agreed a statement welcoming "the intention of the Commission to include proposals for increased flexibility for member states with respect to reduced rates of VAT, which will provide the option to member states of VAT zero-rating sanitary products".  The European Commission has said it is working on two options that would allow member states more flexibility over setting VAT rates and will set out proposals on Wednesday.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35846848	Government backs down in face of Tory 'solar tax' rebellion	Downing Street has said it will not resist attempts by Tory Eurosceptics to block a rise in VAT on solar panels after it faced potential defeat.  Tory rebels angry at EU influence over UK tax rates were set to join forces with Labour to stop any rise in the 5% rate on home insulation and renewables.  Ministers have also conceded ground in another EU-related tax row.  The government said it will not block a separate amendment calling for a 0% VAT rate for women's sanitary products.  In the wake of Wednesday's Budget, UK officials said EU leaders had agreed a deal to allow the UK to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", the 5% VAT rate on women's sanitary products.  The UK is seeking more flexibility over VAT rates currently set at an EU level. The European Commission is set to publish proposals on Wednesday on giving member states more leeway over VAT rates.  But about a dozen Tory Eurosceptics were still planning to side with Labour by backing amendments to the Finance Bill demanding action on the twin tax issues - which are in the spotlight ahead of June's EU referendum.  Eurosceptics have been persistent critics of rules in force since the early 1990s harmonising VAT rates across the EU, arguing they undermine national sovereignty and the right of member states to set their own tax rates.  The UK and other EU members cannot levy sales tax at less than the standard 15% rate except on specified items. For these approved products and services, countries have the scope to charge VAT at a reduced rate of no less than 5%.  The UK has long applied a 5% rate to the installation of domestic energy-saving products for anyone over the age of 60 who is unemployed, disabled or claiming benefits such as income support or housing benefit.  But the current 5% rate was ruled illegal by the European Court of Justice in June. The Court said it was a breach of EU laws as the products and services concerned did not fall within the VAT directive which only exempts the "provision, construction, renovation and alteration of housing as part of social policy" and the "renovation and repairing of private dwellings".  Labour had warned VAT could rise to at least 15% as early as August unless the chancellor takes immediate action and that such a move would cost thousands of jobs in the renewables sector.  The opposition, which supports EU membership but has been critical of cuts to solar and renewable subsidies, has tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill "empowering" George Osborne to set a zero rates on insulation and renewable materials or, alternatively, to compensate the industry for the financial impact that any VAT rise would have on jobs and investment.  Labour's amendment, expected to come to a vote on Tuesday, had won the support of a dozen Tories who are unhappy about EU control over UK tax rates and seeking to highlight the issue in the run-up to June's EU referendum.  Those backing it include former ministers Tim Loughton and Peter Lilley and Graham Brady, chair of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservatives - all of whom want the UK to leave the EU.  If it fails to abide by the ECJ's ruling, the UK could face infringement proceedings and potential financial penalties.  But Mr Brady told the BBC News Channel the question at issue was whether the UK "decided its own tax policy or not".  "I think it is really important that just because we have had these welcome concessions, it does not make us forget we are in a position where we have to seek permission from other governments of other countries to allow us to make these changes even if the majority of people in our Parliament want those changes in tax policy."  With a working majority of 17 in the House of Commons, the government faced defeat if the SNP and the Lib Dems had also supported the opposition amendment.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35861447	What is the row around PIPs all about?	At the heart of the row between the now former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith and his government are PIPs - Personal Independence Payments.  But why have they become so controversial?  PIPs are benefit payments made to help people aged 16 to 64 cope with the extra costs they face due to ill health or disability. Not means-tested, they are gradually replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA).  Nearly 700,000 people currently claim PIP, with another 1.5 million still to be reassessed.  DLA was based entirely on self-assessment, whereas eligibility for PIP depends on a test carried out by Atos or Capita on behalf of the government. Money is allocated according to a points system and eligibility is kept under regular review.  The criteria for PIP were already stricter than DLA - for example, in the past someone was considered to be "virtually unable to walk", and therefore eligible, if they could not walk more than about 50 metres. Under PIP, that was dropped to 20 metres, excluding, at the government's estimate, more than 420,000 people.  Ministers wanted to make the criteria stricter still and that desire is at the crux of the current row.  There are two components - daily living and mobility - and eligibility is based on ability to carry out 12 activities, including eating and drinking, washing, going to the toilet, communicating and getting around.  The more severe someone's needs the more they will receive - up to a maximum of £139.75 a week.  The money can be spent on a wide range of things. The mobility element often goes towards specially adapted cars, scooters or wheelchairs, paid for via the Motability scheme. The daily living element can cover anything from a prosthesis to specially designed utensils, hand rails and toilet seats.  The plan was to reduce the weighting given to two of the 10 criteria for the daily living element - dressing and managing toilet needs. So, instead of someone who needs grab rails to use the toilet receiving two points, they would have only received one.  That single point difference could have meant an individual getting less money, or losing PIP altogether if it put them below the points threshold for qualifying.  An independent review carried out for the Department for Work and Pensions found that "a significant number of people are likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal to no ongoing daily living extra costs".  The department says it reviewed a "number of cases" and in 96% of them the "likely ongoing extra costs of daily living were nil, low or minimal" - for example, because many of the aids and appliances which people are currently getting points for are provided free by the NHS and councils, or could be bought cheaply.  Number 10 also says the cost of PIPs is rising by around a billion pounds a year and needs to be brought under control.  Yes. In his first Budget in 2010, George Osborne made reforming DLA a priority.  Four years later, in October 2014, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecast that spending on disability benefits between 2015 and 2019 would total £55.9bn. By March 2016, that figure had risen to £66.4bn.  The switch to PIP was designed to save money - something sources close to Mr Duncan Smith are continuing to insist it will ultimately do - but things are not as simple as that.  Those same sources have told the BBC the problems are "to do with people transferring to PIP from DLA. They are sicker than the DLA system said they were."  The OBR said the rising costs were because of higher-than-expected caseloads - and people getting more money than ministers had predicted. The average payout is now £100 a week, 14% higher than expected.  Costs have also risen because claimants are being increasingly successful in appealing against officials' decisions, often helped by charities.  Not everyone would have lost out, and those who did would have only lost cash as and when their conditions were reassessed.  However, charities said up to 640,000 people would be affected by 2020, each standing to lose up to £100 a week.  Labour said the changes would have removed the ability of many people to live independently.  And of course, the loudest critic of all has been Mr Duncan Smith, who said the decision to "juxtapose" the changes with tax cuts for the better off in the Budget was the final straw.  For its part, the government says making the criteria stricter would have saved £1.2bn a year and made the system "fairer". More broadly, it puts the changes in the context of the planned introduction of Universal Credit - the new single monthly payment of benefits and tax credits due for roll-out from 2017 - under which it says some people will be better off.  The proposals have been shelved.  However, the government said just a few days before the Budget that it wanted to save a further £4.4bn from the UK welfare bill. Asked how the chancellor would cover the shortfall created by not going ahead with the PIP changes, Downing Street suggested the issue would be looked at in the Autumn Statement.  Number 10 has, though, stressed that PIP will still have to be reformed in the future as the cost is "unsustainable."  More broadly, there is the political fall-out. What damage has been done to George Osborne and indeed, David Cameron, and the impact Mr Duncan Smith's resignation will have on the EU referendum campaign, all remain to be seen.	politics

The evening event in San Francisco was held on the same day as a Microsoft-sponsored "women in games" lunch.  The dancers were dressed in short skirts and crop tops.  Phil Spencer said it was "unequivocally wrong", after attendees took to social media to complain.  The event took place during a week-long conference for developers creating games for Xbox.  "I like dancing, I like talking to dev[eloper]s. But not at this party. Thanks for pushing me out of this party, Microsoft.," tweeted Kamina Vincent, an editor at the Tin Man Games studio, based in Australia.  Ms Vincent said it was the first time she had felt unwelcome at a games event.  She told the Huffington Post one of the dancers had said she had been hired to "speak with attendees and encourage them to the dance floor".  As in much of the tech sector, the number of women who work in the computer game industry remains low.  In 2015, the Association for UK Interactive Entertainment said 14% of the UK workforce and 22% of the global workforce were women.  However, some people disagreed the party organisers had made a mistake.  In a staff email, also published online, Mr Spencer wrote: "It has come to my attention that at Xbox-hosted events at GDC [Game Developers Conference] this past week, we represented Xbox and Microsoft in a way that was absolutely not consistent or aligned to our values.  "This matter is being handled internally, but let me be very clear - how we represent ourselves as individuals, who we hire and partner with and how we engage with others is a direct reflection of our brand and what we stand for.  "When we do the opposite, and create an environment that alienates or offends any group, we justly deserve the criticism."  Microsoft parties have featured go-go dancers in the past.  "Microsoft Techset party has red-lace go-go dancers on the roof," tweeted Omar L in 2010.  "Um, there are go-go dancers in Day-Glo bikinis at the Microsoft holiday party," tweeted Iain Kennedy in 2011.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35860814	Powa: The start-up that fell to earth	It was one of Britain's brightest tech start-ups, praised by David Cameron, and a rare British "unicorn" - a company valued at over $1bn (£694,000) before floating on a stock market.  Its dynamic founder Dan Wagner claimed last year that his business was worth $2.7bn (£1.9bn) and had signed a deal in China with "limitless" potential.  But last month Powa Technologies collapsed into administration - and it rapidly became clear that it was more akin to a lame old donkey than a unicorn. Its demise has raised questions about the health of London's much vaunted fintech (financial technology) sector, and about the wisdom of sky-high valuations for unproven businesses.  In recent weeks, I've spoken to a number of people connected to the mobile ecommerce company in an attempt to work out what went wrong.  What those people have told me is that Powa was an almost textbook case of how not to run a company - no clear strategy, directionless management, overblown claims about the technology and a reckless attitude to money.  For the last couple of years, I've been receiving emails from Powa's PR agency urging me to cover the company's ground breaking technology the PowaTag which "allows users to purchase anytime, anywhere in just three seconds by simply scanning an item or advertisement with their smartphone".  Eventually, the company claimed that it had 1,200 businesses signed up to use the PowaTag.  I was not particularly impressed. I saw little evidence that the technology was being used, but one investor did bite. A Boston-based firm Wellington Management invested a sizeable sum in Mr Wagner's venture. Eventually they along with other investors poured more than $200m into Powa.  It seems likely they were told the same story that was peddled to journalists - that the PowaTag was going to be used by some of the world's leading brands including L'Oreal and Carrefour.  But what's emerged since the collapse of the business is that none of those companies had signed contracts, merely "letters of intent", which did not commit them to anything. One senior figure in the company told me that young inexperienced sales staff were rewarded with a £2,000 bonus every time one of these letters was signed "so they weren't particularly concerned about the quality of the deal".  Mr Wagner, who claims to have a stellar record as a serial entrepreneur, was still telling everyone who would listen that his was a company that would be bigger than Google or Facebook one day. As recently as last October, he told Evan Davis on Radio 4's Bottom Line that the business had been valued at $2.7bn by its backers Wellington. Evan suggested that was a meaningless figure because Powa hadn't made any money yet.  "We're a growth tech business," Mr Wagner replied, maintaining it was other people who had set that value.  Just before Christmas, it seemed that he had been vindicated. Powa's PR firm approached the BBC with a story that the company had done an amazing deal in China. It would see the PowaTag gain access to the 1.3 billion customers of China UnionPay, the country's leading force in payments, and open up a new era of mobile commerce.  Mr Wagner was triumphant. In an interview with the BBC he said: "Why did China UnionPay decide to partner with a little British technology company? We've trumped Apple Pay and the rest of the world here."  Behind the scenes, the Powa team that had negotiated the deal was shocked - they had told Mr Wagner not to oversell the deal but he had gone off script. "He just shot his mouth off," one told me.  "The Chinese were furious, they don't like that kind of boasting."  What's more, any deal had been done with an intermediary, not China UnionPay, whose lawyers sent a "cease and desist" letter ordering Powa to shut up.  "As matter of fact," says the letter, "our company has not yet established any business relationship with your company".  Powa's PR agency called the BBC asking us to remove Mr Wagner's quote from our article. We refused - he'd said it, after all. A day or so later Apple announced that it was entering China's payments market, and it became evident that "a little British technology company" had not trumped the rest of the world.  But Mr Wagner needed to make plenty of noise about the China deal because Powa was running out of cash and was on a desperate hunt for investors to shore up its balance sheet. Somehow, all of that money from Wellington had been spent.  Some of it had gone on office space - Powa occupied two floors of the prestigious Heron Tower at the heart of the city of London, and had equally lavish accommodation in Hong Kong, New York and across Europe.  Warren Cowen, whose Greenlight digital agency bought PowaWeb - a small part of the business - out of administration, told me he was taken aback when he visited the grandiose offices in Heron Tower: "We operate out of a gritty warehouse in King's Cross."  Then there were the parties and dinners where the fine wines flowed and huge bills were racked up. According to several former employees, at one Christmas bash in Mayfair, strippers were hired to perform, to the discomfort of many present. "There was a very sexist culture," one younger employee told me. "It was very 1980s."  There were very generous salaries too - at a senior level some executives were paid large six figure sums - but that did not make staff happy in their work. On the Glassdoor jobs site, where employees rate companies as places to work, Powa's entry features a clutch of reviews criticising the management, and in particular the chief executive.  One of the more printable comments is this: "You don't employ intelligent, highly experienced people to treat them like something unpleasant under your shoe by telling them to forget everything they know, as your way isn't working."  Mind you, things seemed to have improved last July when there was a sudden rash of four and five star reviews. That might be the result of an email about these negative reviews sent to all staff by Ant Sharp, Mr Wagner's right-hand man.  He asked them to post positive reviews on Glassdoor, explaining: "You can make your posting completely anonymous. And would you please send your contribution from a personal email account and not your Powa one."  He told them that if they did this he would give them Starbucks vouchers, but if they didn't feel able to help they should come and see him and "chat about your unhappiness".  By this January, staff had very good reasons to feel unhappy as they were no longer being paid. An internal finance report seen by the BBC has a section headlined Cash Management and Insolvency Trading.  Underneath, the bullet points include "operating over the last four months with less incoming funds than monthly cash burn" and "ensuring we follow 'good practices' under the insolvency guidelines".  It is clear Powa was teetering on the brink of insolvency.  But on 12 January, all staff received a bizarre email from Mr Wagner. The subject line said, "Long live the legacy of David Bowie".  The email featured a photo of Mr Wagner dressed as Ziggy Stardust in full make-up with the caption: "I don't do tributes in half measures!"  The employees were not impressed. One told me: "While the company was going under, he's fooling around in a photography studio pretending to be Ziggy Stardust. The guy is a narcissistic idiot."  It was a month later that Wellington Management decided enough was enough, and called in Deloitte to act as administrators. The insolvency has managed to dispose of parts of the business but the majority of the staff have lost their jobs. In the next week or so, Deloitte is expected to publish details of the financial situation it found at Powa Technologies, which last filed accounts for 2013.  Companies go bust all the time - why should anyone care but the investors who have lost money and the employees who lost their jobs? One Powa executive, who has gone on to work for another technology firm, says there are serious issues for London as a centre of financial technology firms: "People are telling me this is making it harder to raise money."  I wanted to ask Wellington Management about the due diligence it had undertaken before its investment in Powa, but the company politely declined to talk to me.  I have also tried to reach Dan Wagner on a number of occasions to hear his side of the story. So far, I have received no reply.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35861021	How damaged is George Osborne by IDS resignation?	George Osborne: chief tactician and patron, a man whose word makes or wrecks careers.  That was the view of many Tory MPs for a very long time.  Now, many doubt he will ever be their leader, or even the chancellor much longer.  It's not that they think David Cameron is poised to sack him or that he's about to resign, as Labour demand.  They simply believe a swift leadership election is highly likely whatever the result of 23 June's EU referendum.  If it does come that soon there will be, one predicts, a "genocide of the Cameroons and Osbornites".  A stubbornly enduring deficit, a tax credit U-turn, and the sheer numbers of MPs who have chosen to back a leave vote at the referendum have seen Osborne's authority leak.  A weekend of melodrama has - in one Tory MP's view - burst the dam.  Cameron and Osborne's decade long effort to present their leadership as an exercise in compassionate politics is under direct threat.  One backbencher, Sarah Wollaston, went on the Today programme to demand a signal Osborne was willing to rethink his Budget, and suggest that manifesto guarantees to protect pensioners could be dropped.  And there is a coalition at work - opposition parties, Eurosceptic and centrist Tory backbenchers - that can overturn the government's thin majority and stop it delivering manifesto commitments.  They are eyeing two possible votes on Tuesday night, both demanding Britain should be able to set VAT rates free of EU influence, as a chance to flex their muscles.  As political advisor, MP, precociously young shadow chancellor and minister, Osborne has fought and won more scraps than most.  If some of his allies need him more than they love him, his network spreads far and wide.  Crucially, Number 10 are not about to restage the Blair era battles between PM and Chancellor.  So he will fight, but many more concessions to his critics could cost his dearly.	politics

Modern conflicts are no longer about warring states and control over territory, but more about identity, control of the population and the political decision-making process, argues military researcher Thomas Elkjer Nissen.  This makes Twitter ripe for exploitation in any conflict. It is the network users turn to for news, and where news organisations break stories, so interested parties need their version of events to appear on timelines  It has been used most notably by jihadist groups but, increasingly, there are also worries that states such as Russia may be using the network to influence populations without anyone noticing.  The number of supporters of the so-called Islamic State on Twitter is tiny - about 46,000 in total, according to a Brookings Institute survey in 2014.  Despite this, the group has used Twitter to gain and hold the attention of a mass audience, and to attract supporters.  Researcher JM Berger of George Washington University has laid out how the group "grooms" new members: from looking for potential supporters in Muslim-oriented networks, to surrounding targets with a small community that interacts with them and then encouraging a recruit to take action.  "The user often starts with a link in a tweet and is then led further and further into the narrative on blogs, videos and other social media - possibly ending up in a conversation with a recruiter," says Mr Nissen.  "As one of the big three open social networks used by terrorists - Facebook and YouTube being the other two - Twitter is a quick way to send messages, which are easily redistributed by supporters, linking across different media."  IS communicates very effectively on Twitter. It puts out timely information in several languages and uses a variety of multimedia, from cat images to horrifying killings, to engage its audience emotionally.  When IS captured Mosul in Iraq in 2014 the group aggressively used bots and spammed popular hashtags to ensure its propaganda was visible on Twitter, even to people not looking for it.  Berger has estimated that as many as 20% of tweets from IS supporters could have been created by bots or apps.  And IS is not the only group to use Twitter for propaganda. When Somali terrorist group Al-Shabab attacked the Westgate Mall in Nairobi in 2013, the group crowed over the attack and live-tweeted events, easily creating new accounts every time one was shut.  Such events can create the impression the group is stronger and has more support than it actually does. While IS's tweets are easily identifiable, some believe a greater threat may come from the anonymous use of Twitter by states.  Several Russian and Western media organisations have documented the experiences of former Russian trolls and their work and reported observations of suspicious behaviour on social media.  There is still a lack of hard evidence linking such activity directly to the Kremlin. The covert nature of trolling makes it difficult to estimate the extent of influence Russia's trolls may have on Twitter.  Researching this field is social science student Lawrence Alexander, who maps relationships between accounts and has identified what he believes are pro-Kremlin Twitter bots promoting Russian news agencies and pro-Kremlin blogs.  In one instance, he found 2,900 accounts tweeting a specific phrase saying that the opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, who was murdered last February, was killed by Ukrainians because "he was stealing one of their girlfriends".  While not completely certain they were all bots, many of the accounts were following each other and a majority had never favourited a tweet, arguably suspicious behaviour when compared with a random selection of accounts.  Troll influence has extended beyond Russia's borders. In the US, Russian trolls are suspected of tweeting false news of disasters in 2014: an accident at a chemical factory in Louisiana and an outbreak of Ebola in Atlanta.  Eliot Higgins, the founder of Bellingcat, a company that crowdsources information about the Syrian and Ukrainian conflicts, found himself a target, particularly over Bellingcat's investigation identifying the missile launcher said to be responsible for shooting down flight MH17.  "I started off by posting a lot on the Guardian live blog comments before I started my own blogs and some of the people from that followed me on to Twitter and still disagree with me strongly and vocally there up until today, five years later," he says.  "What's been interesting for me is having this Syria community of trolls and the community of pro-Russian trolls that built up around MH17 and my work, now coming together after Russia's involvement in Syria. It's nice to bring people together, even when it's in their mutual and obsessive hatred of one person.  "Recently we've even had the Russian Ministry of Defence and Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs putting out statements attacking Bellingcat. They seem to be basing it on what the trolls are saying," he adds.  Countries with Russian minorities - Germany and the Baltic states - have been following the issue closely and both the EU and Nato have formed units to counter what they see as a propaganda war online.  As a study at the University of Warwick has found, false rumours on Twitter take much longer to resolve than those eventually proven to be true. Or, as the meme would have it: "The amount of energy necessary to refute bull is an order of magnitude bigger than to produce it."  The lesson is: be wary of what you read on Twitter.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35833128	Are the Scottish and EU referendums similar?	Is the referendum on Britain's EU membership turning into a re-run of Scotland's independence vote?  Many of the arguments have a familiar ring to them - but there are some crucial differences and, perhaps, lessons to be learned.  Scots were warned of the risks of leaving the UK in 2014. The UK government claimed "going it alone would be costly", suggesting homeowners could face higher mortgage payments and ruling out a currency union.  Now, voters are being told of the potential economic consequences of leaving the EU. Prime Minister David Cameron has said: "A vote to leave is the gamble of the century. And it would be our children's futures on the table if we were to roll the dice."  Campaigners in favour of Scottish independence and those who back leaving the EU have been accused of understating the risks of change.  In both debates the risks of the status-quo were also highlighted. In the Scottish campaign, pro-independence activists said the NHS would be under threat if the union continued, while pro-Brexit campaigners warn of security threats staying the in the EU and a worsening migration crisis.  During Scotland's debate, some business leaders wrote open letters urging Scotland to remain in the UK. That's happened against with the EU debate, with bosses of companies including BT, Marks & Spencer and Vodafone signing a letter saying an EU exit would deter investment in the UK.  Lloyds Banking Group said during the Scottish campaign that it would relocate to London if Scotland chose independence. Standard Life also threatened to move.  This time, HSBC has warned it will move jobs to France.  Speaking months before Scotland went to the polls in 2014, US President Barack Obama said the US wanted to retain a "strong, robust, united and effective partner" in the United Kingdom.  The Spanish prime minister fired a warning at Scotland, saying it would have to negotiate its way into the EU if it left the UK (though he had a vested interest, given independence movements in Spain).  Chinese Premier Li Keqiang stressed that he wanted to see a "united" United Kingdom.  This time the EU has a vested interest in the UK staying. A number of leaders from the bloc have said they want the UK to stay.  President Obama has previously said the UK must stay in the EU to continue to have influence on the world stage and will visit the UK soon (pro-leave figures have warned him against an intervention).  The term "project fear" was coined by a staffer from the pro-UK Better Together campaign during the independence vote.  Then Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond urged Scots to embrace the "hope of yes" rather than the "fears of no". Project Fear became a byword for negative campaigning from the pro-union side.  And the exact same term has already become one of the key phrases of the EU debate. Boris Johnson has slammed "the agents of project fear", while a spokesman for Leave EU told me "project fear" was all the UK government had to offer.  The prime minister has said he believes he is presenting "project fact". Downing Street has also sought to portray some of the the PM's speeches as focussing on the positive economic advantages of EU membership.  Just days before Scotland voted on its future in the UK, The Queen said she hoped "people will think very carefully about the future" to a well-wisher outside church near her Balmoral estate in Aberdeenshire.  The comment came after reports suggested she was worried about the vote. Royal officials insisted her comment did not breach the monarch's constitutional impartiality.  Buckingham Palace has again insisted the Queen is "politically neutral" over the EU referendum, following a claim in the Sun that she "backs Brexit".  The newspaper quoted sources, one of whom claims to have witnessed a "bust-up" between the Queen and pro-EU former Deputy PM Nick Clegg in 2011, where the monarch is said to have told Mr Clegg the EU was "heading in the wrong direction".  Labour MP Kate Hoey, who is co-chair of the Labour Leave campaign, says negative campaigning turns people off referendums. And she can see parallels with the Scottish "fear factor".  "There's no doubt about it, that there was this fear factor up there, again being pushed by the prime minister and the chancellor," she says.  She adds the leave campaign will look to "build on what happened in Scotland".  Robert Oxley, head of press for Leave.EU, says his side has been looking at the lessons of the Scottish vote.  "The lessons are that you do have to have a positive vision," he says. "You do have to engage people on the ground, you have to be prepared for last minute government interventions - and not necessarily playing by the rules."  Alex Salmond was the figurehead of the pro-independence 'Yes' campaign.  He agrees with Leave campaigners that people are put off by negative campaigning. But he says both sides are guilty of it this time around.  "In the Scottish referendum campaign one side was presenting hope and the vision of a better future, which is ultimately the thing that mobilises people," he says.  "When you have two fear-ridden campaign at the end of the day they fight to a no score draw".  No. The UK government says its campaign is positive and argues it is pointing out the benefits of staying in a reform EU, as well as the potential dangers of leaving it.  Michael Fallon, the Scotland-born defence secretary, says the campaign this time will be "slightly different".  There was more emotion in the Scottish debate, he adds, but this is more about where is Britain strongest and best off.  "It will be based more, I hope, on the facts," he says.	politics

He attacked the "desperate search for savings" focused on benefit payments to people who "don't vote for us".  And he told the BBC's Andrew Marr his "painful" decision was "not personal" against Chancellor George Osborne.  Downing Street said it was sorry to see Iain Duncan Smith go but was determined to help "everyone in our society".  BBC political correspondent Alan Soady said Mr Duncan Smith's interview - which followed his resignation over cuts to disability benefits on Friday - was an "absolutely blistering attack".  He added: "This was not just about his objections to one change in disability benefit, he was questioning the fundamental principles underpinning the government."  Mr Duncan Smith told the BBC he had supported a consultation on the changes to Personal Independence Payments but had come under "massive pressure" to deliver the savings ahead of last week's Budget.  The way the cuts were presented in the Budget had been "deeply unfair", he said, because they were "juxtaposed" with tax cuts for the wealthy.  He criticised the "arbitrary" decision to lower the welfare cap after the general election and suggested the government was in danger of losing "the balance of the generations", expressing his "deep concern" at a "very narrow attack on working-age benefits" while also protecting pensioner benefits.  If the focus on the working-age benefit budget continued, he said, "it just looks like we see this as a pot of money, that it doesn't matter because they don't vote for us".  Mr Duncan Smith, who said he felt he had become "semi-detached" from government, said the Conservatives had to return to being a party "that cares about even those who do not vote for us".  He said he cared "passionately" about "people who don't get the choices my children get" and "bringing people back in to an arena where we play daily but they do not".  He suggested the government was in "danger of drifting in a direction that divides society rather than unites it, and that, I think, is unfair".  In his interview, Mr Duncan Smith gave his version of a deteriorating relationship with the government, saying he had considered resigning last year and had "long-running" concerns about cuts imposed since May's general election.  He said the disability benefit cuts should have been part of a "much wider programme" - but after Christmas "pressure began to grow" to rush a consultation so they could feature in Wednesday's Budget.  Asked why he had not spoken out when the measures were presented to cabinet, he said he "sat silently" as he "realised the full state of what was happening" with tax cuts featuring elsewhere in the Budget.  After thinking "long and hard", he said he agreed to write to MPs to reassure them over the disability cuts, saying "it's not what it sounds like in the Budget".  But he said he realised in the following two days "there was no way I would able to stop this process" and resigned on Friday evening.  What pushes a cabinet minister to resign so sensationally?  Its origins lie partly in the rapid shift of the economic gloom-o-meter. Forecasts in December's Autumn Statement were upbeat, predicting more money rolling into the Treasury.  By Wednesday's Budget, the sunshine had turned into "storm clouds". They blew over Iain Duncan-Smith's department because welfare changes of recent years have so far brought in nothing like the savings originally projected.  IDS signed off on tightening the rules around Personal Independence Payments five days before the Budget, but now says he would rather have been allowed to wait so he could see who were the winners and losers.  As the row gathered momentum after the Budget, Education Secretary Nicky Morgan suggested the plans weren't set in stone.  Mr Duncan Smith's people disagreed, firmly believing the proposals were final. The following day, Downing Street suggested a U-turn was on the cards.  For IDS, it was the final straw, believing he was going to carry the can for a policy he claims he'd been bounced into prematurely. Others question his account - asking why he signed off the proposal in the first place if he was so against it.  Mr Duncan Smith spoke of his "love" for the Conservative Party and described claims he was trying to undermine David Cameron as "nonsense", saying he had had a "robust" conversation with the PM after telling him of his resignation.  Asked whether Mr Osborne would make a good prime minister, he added: "If he was to stand and if he was elected by the electorate, which is not just me it is everybody else, I would hope that he would."  A Number 10 spokesman said: "We are sorry to see Iain Duncan Smith go, but we are a 'one nation' government determined to continue helping everyone in our society have more security and opportunity, including the most disadvantaged.  "That means we will deliver our manifesto commitments to make the welfare system fairer, cut taxes and ensure we have a stable economy by controlling welfare spending and living within our means."  He said more people were in work under this government with fewer "trapped" on unemployment benefits.  Former Lib Dem minister David Laws told Andrew Marr divisions between Mr Osborne and Mr Duncan Smith over welfare had been a "running sore throughout the last parliament".  He said: "George Osborne, I think it's fair to say, did regard the welfare budget as something of a cash cow to be squeezed in order to help to deliver deficit reduction. Iain Duncan Smith had a different view."  Mr Duncan Smith's resignation has divided his former ministerial team at the DWP.  Pensions minister Baroness Ros Altmann attacked his tenure, describing him as "exceptionally difficult" to work for, and accused him of using his resignation "to do maximum damage to the party leadership" in order to support the campaign to leave the EU.  But her fellow DWP minister Shailesh Vara said he was "surprised" at Baroness Altmann's comments, saying: "Ros's recollection does not accord with mine and I'm sorry that this has all happened."  Disabilities minister Justin Tomlinson said the former secretary of state had "always conducted himself in a professional, dedicated and determined manner", while employment minister Priti Patel told BBC Radio 5 live it had been a "privilege" to work for him.  Owen Smith, Labour's welfare spokesman, said Mr Duncan Smith had been "very honest in explaining how George Osborne could have taken different choices" and had revealed "the fundamental unfairness at the heart of government policy".

On Friday, Mr Duncan Smith said he was quitting as work and pensions secretary in protest at disability benefits cuts.  But Lady Altmann, who described her ex-boss as "exceptionally difficult" to work for, accused him of wanting "to do maximum damage to the party leadership" to help his campaign to leave the EU.  Sources close to Mr Duncan Smith insist his resignation was not about the EU.  Meanwhile, former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind has told the BBC he finds Iain Duncan Smith's behaviour "bizarre".  He said it was "difficult to believe that someone committed to welfare issues would resign on them",  Mr Duncan Smith is due to give his first interview since resigning on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show at 09:00 GMT. Stephen Crabb was appointed as Mr Duncan Smith's replacement on Saturday.  In his resignation letter, which many commentators have interpreted as an attack on Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Duncan Smith said the latest changes to benefits for the disabled were "not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers".  But Lady Altmann said she was "shocked" by the resignation saying her former boss had "championed the very package of reforms to disability benefits he now says is the reason he has resigned".  In a statement, Lady Altmann said: "This really seems to be about the European referendum campaign.  "He seems to want to do maximum damage to the party leadership in order to further his campaign to try to get Britain to leave the EU.  "As far as I could tell, he appeared to spend much of the last few months plotting over Europe and against the leadership of the party and it seemed to me he had been planning to find a reason to resign for a long time."  She also said she had found him "exceptionally difficult" to work for and said he had "often been obstructive to my efforts to resolve important pension policy issues".  Former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said that Mr Duncan Smith "quite clearly knew" before the chancellor's statement how his department would be affected.  He should have made it clear he wanted to resign before the budget was announced, Mr Rifkind said.  But another of Mr Duncan Smith's junior ministers, employment minister Priti Patel, praised Mr Duncan Smith as a "great social reformer".  "Since coming to office in 2010, he has made a real difference to the life chances of people throughout the country by reforming the welfare system to ensure that work always pays," she said.  And Justice Secretary Michael Gove, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, called Mr Duncan Smith "an inspirational social reformer" who has been "guided throughout by a clear sense of noble moral purpose".  However, Mr Gove, who like Ms Patel and Mr Duncan Smith, is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU, wrote that a "united and resolute government" was needed.  He wrote that he also "hugely" admired Mr Osborne and said that "I can't - and won't - take issue with either of them in the areas they've championed and led".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on the disability budget but changes to benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn on this by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), due to replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn a year, but sparked an outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs.  But on Friday, before Mr Duncan Smith resigned, a government source had said the planned changes would be "kicked into the long grass".  Replying to Mr Duncan Smith on Friday, David Cameron said he was "puzzled and disappointed" that Mr Duncan Smith had decided to go when they had agreed to have a rethink about the policies.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35851269	Who is Stephen Crabb?	Appointed amid the furore of Iain Duncan Smith's explosive resignation, Stephen Crabb has already been tipped to make the headlines in his own right.  The 43-year-old former Welsh secretary, raised by his mother on a council estate in Haverfordwest, has a back story that contrasts sharply with that of many of his cabinet colleagues.  He has spoken in interviews of the "horrible decisions about what food and clothing was affordable" as he was growing up.  Many see his personal story as well suited to his new role at the Department for Work and Pensions, where he will take on the reforms championed by Mr Duncan Smith and fiercely opposed by some charities and opposition MPs.  In an interview with BBC Wales Westminster correspondent David Cornock last month, the MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire described how the welfare system had provided a "genuine safety net at a time of crisis" for his family.  "I had a mother who, as we got older, moved progressively from a position of complete welfare dependency to being fully economically independent, working full-time," he said.  "And that has to be the model of the way the welfare system should work."  Mr Crabb says his first political memory is the 1979 general election that brought Margaret Thatcher to power, and that witnessing her flagship right-to-buy policy on his street had a "huge impact" on him growing up.  After attending Tasker Milward school in Haverfordwest, he studied at Bristol University, gaining a first-class degree in politics, joining the Conservative Party after graduating.  He won his seat at the second attempt in 2005, and worked as a whip before becoming a minister in the Wales Office, where he was appointed secretary of state in July 2014.  Mr Crabb, who is married with two children, lives near Haverfordwest and is a keen rugby player.  He is the first Conservative cabinet minister for a century to have a beard - and David Cameron recently jokingly suggested he could be the next James Bond after comparing him to Hollywood star Russell Crowe.  It's not the only role the new work and pensions secretary - who unlike Mr Duncan Smith supports the UK remaining in the European Union - has been tipped for.  He is well thought-of in Conservative circles - and with David Cameron to stand down as party leader before the next election, some think he could be in line for a bigger promotion.  Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson recently told the Daily Telegraph she would "find it very hard to vote for anyone else" if he was involved in a leadership contest, while the influential Conservative Home website says his promotion will boost his leadership prospects.  "His political convictions were not forged on the playing fields of Eton and his summer job was working on a building site," WalesOnline's political editor David Williamson wrote last week, in an article asking whether Mr Crabb could be the man to unite the Tories after the EU referendum.  Asked about leadership ambitions by the BBC's David Cornock, Mr Crabb said: "I don't think I have an ambition to become leader, really.  "It doesn't feel that long ago in my life that the thought of becoming an MP seemed outlandish and unrealistic, so to find myself a few years ahead sitting at the cabinet table doing a job for Wales, I just feel incredibly blessed with that really."  He went on to say he would fancy "a shot at doing something UK-wide" in the future.  On the morning of his appointment, he tweeted about his "busy Saturday" including an advice surgery in Haverfordwest followed by Wales versus Italy in the Six Nations rugby.  With his sudden elevation into one of the most high-profile jobs in cabinet, it has just got even busier.	politics

Mr Duncan Smith said the latest planned cuts to disability benefits were "not defensible" in a Budget that benefited higher-earning taxpayers.  In response, Mr Cameron said they had "collectively agreed" on the proposals, before deciding on Friday to have a rethink to "get these policies right".  Stephen Crabb has been named as Mr Duncan Smith's replacement.  Before he was ousted as Conservative leader in 2003, Iain Duncan Smith was dubbed "the quiet man". But there was nothing subdued or understated about the manner of his departure last night.  Instead, a zinger of a resignation letter, designed to inflict maximum damage on Chancellor George Osborne; a relationship that had long been testy, tested to destruction by this week's Budget.  By questioning, as the Conservatives' critics have long done, the Tory slogan to justify cuts - "We are all in this together" - Mr Duncan Smith knowingly provided the government's opponents with ammunition.  For a man with ambitions to lead his party, these have been difficult days for George Osborne.  This morning David Cameron woke to a vacancy in his cabinet and a wound inflicted on his government.  In his Budget on Wednesday, Chancellor George Osborne had said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability but changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn a year and sparked outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs.  On Friday, prior to Mr Duncan Smith's resignation, a government source said the planned changes would be "kicked into the long grass".  Baroness Stroud, who worked with Mr Duncan Smith in government and now heads the Centre for Social Justice think tank, which he founded, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "Iain came into government... in order to deliver a social justice agenda, a reform agenda of the welfare state.  "He always used to say to me, 'I'm here in order to deliver reform and to protect the poorest'.  "Yesterday he felt that he could no longer protect the poorest... This is a step too far."  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon told Today he was also "disappointed" by Mr Duncan Smith's resignation but the welfare reform programme would "go on".  Frank Field, who chairs the Commons work and pensions committee, said: "Behind this is a much, much bigger drama of which Iain was the driver... What he crucially cared about was the balance of resources going to families and children and older people.  "The pensioner element, the biggest part of the Budget, was safeguarded and in fact increased.  "And therefore all these cuts were on people of working age and it's this point that Iain thinks the social contract between generations is being broken."  In his reply to Mr Duncan Smith's resignation letter, Mr Cameron said there had been collective agreement that "the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most".  "That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago," he said.  "Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  "In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign."  Mr Cameron's letter also highlighted that they were "on different sides in the vital debate about the future of Britain's relations with Europe".  Sources close to Mr Duncan Smith, who wants the UK to leave the EU, say his resignation was not about Europe.  In his resignation letter, Mr Duncan Smith said that "because of the perilous public finances we inherited from the last Labour administration, difficult cuts have been necessary".  "I have found some of these cuts easier to justify than others but aware of the economic situation and determined to be a team player I have accepted their necessity.  "You are aware that I believe the cuts would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners but I have attempted to work within the constraints that you and the chancellor set."  But he went on: "I have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are a compromise too far.  "While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers."  He added: "I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest."  BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said: "Tensions with the chancellor had been simmering for some time, but there was little warning of Friday's explosion.  "What seemed to be at its core were briefings by government sources which placed responsibility for the controversial changes to PIP firmly at Mr Duncan Smith's door, while he had in fact felt some pressure from the Treasury to deliver them."  Mr Duncan Smith was Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003, and had been work and pensions secretary since the 2010 general election.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron have both called for Mr Osborne to resign.  Mr Corbyn said: "The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith reveals a government in disarray and a chancellor who has lost the credibility to manage the economy in the interests of the majority of our people."

Senior ministers are "absolutely furious" about his resignation and departure from government.  Some ministers believe the claims in his letter are "just not true because he is well aware that the welfare changes have always clearly been about saving money as well as improving the systems".  It's suggested that his central motivation is the EU referendum, and, for others who are supporting him, a strategy to kill off George Osborne's hope of taking over from David Cameron.  IDS's team is adamant that his exit is entirely about the handling of PIPs (Personal Independence Payments) and nothing to do with the EU.  Whatever the truth, it is very dangerous for a political party to be so publicly divided, and, on a very simple level, for its members to be so angry with each other.	politics

He complains of pressure to "salami slice" welfare, saying the latest cuts were a "compromise too far" in a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers.  David Cameron said he was "puzzled and disappointed" at the resignation.  Earlier, the government had indicated it would look again at some of the proposed disability benefits changes.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said: "There had been bad blood off and on between Chancellor George Osborne and Iain Duncan Smith over some of the more controversial welfare reforms, but nobody expected this move only 48 hours since the Budget."  She added that she understood Mr Cameron had personally tried to persuade Mr Duncan Smith to stay on and called the resignation "a bombshell at a very sensitive time".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne had said the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability but changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier had suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.  They included changes to Personal Independence Payments (PIP), which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) in January 2017, that were expected to save £1.3bn and sparked outcry from opposition parties and some Tory MPs. A government source said on Friday they would be "kicked into the long grass".  Mr Duncan Smith, who was the Conservative Party leader and Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003, wrote in his resignation letter that the changes to disability benefits were "defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit".  But he said they should have formed part of "a wider process" of finding the best way to focus resources on those most in need.  "I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self-imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest," Mr Duncan Smith said.  "Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a Budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working-age benefit bill.  "There has been too much emphasis on money-saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.  "It is therefore with enormous regret that I have decided to resign."  He wrote that he believed the cuts "would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners".  In his reply to Mr Duncan Smith, Mr Cameron said they had all agreed that "the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most".  "That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago," he said.  "Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  "In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign."  A source close to Iain Duncan Smith told me his resignation is "because of their behaviour. This is not about Europe"  Iain Duncan Smith is understood to have told them that the government "can't keep taking money from the working poor."  He was concerned that his "narrative for welfare reforms was in danger of being thrown away." He felt he had no choice but to act because welfare reforms "matter more than anything".  Over the weekend Iain Duncan Smith discovered the Chancellor planned to offer cuts in Capital Gains Tax and was very unhappy that those tax cuts were to be offered to the better off, while he had been forced to make more welfare cuts prematurely, in his view. When Number 10 and the Treasury then backtracked on the reforms to PIP today, he concluded that he could no longer remain in government.  Sources close to him are absolutely adamant that his decision was in no way related to his views on Europe.  Mr Duncan Smith was praised by Tory MP and fellow Out campaigner in the EU referendum Peter Bone as a "man of principle" who had taken the job because he "passionately believed in social justice".  And Tory Eurosceptic MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said that Mr Duncan Smith had been "as important a welfare secretary as I can think of".  "I think it is deeply concerning that a man of the stature and standing of Iain Duncan Smith should be pushed into this position," he added  However, opposition parties welcomed Mr Duncan Smith's resignation and called for Mr Osborne to resign as well.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: "The resignation of Iain Duncan Smith reveals a government in disarray and a chancellor who has lost the credibility to manage the economy in the interests of the majority of our people.  "The chancellor has failed the British people. He should follow the honourable course taken by Iain Duncan Smith and resign."  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter: "IDS resignation may be more about EU than his conscience - but he has struck a fatal blow to #PIP cuts and that's a good thing."  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said: "It is quite right that Iain Duncan Smith has resigned over this heartless plan to cut disability benefits, but the true mastermind of the changes, George Osborne, should also be considering his position."	politics

Here is the full text:  Thank you for your letter this evening.  We are all very proud of the welfare reforms which this government has delivered over the last six years, and in which you have played an important part.  As a government, we have done a huge amount to get people into work, reduce unemployment and promote social justice. There are now more people in work than ever before in our country's history, with 2.4 million more jobs created since 2010.  I regret that you have chosen to step down from the government at this moment. Together we designed the Personal Independence Payment to support the most vulnerable and to give disabled people more independence.  We all agreed that the increased resources being spent on disabled people should be properly managed and focused on those who need it most.  That is why we collectively agreed - you, No 10 and the Treasury - proposals which you and your department then announced a week ago.  Today we agreed not to proceed with the policies in their current form and instead to work together to get these policies right over the coming months.  In the light of this, I am puzzled and disappointed that you have chosen to resign.  You leave the government with my thanks and best wishes.  While we are on different sides in the vital debate about the future of Britain's relations with Europe, the government will, of course, continue with its policy of welfare reform, matched by our commitment to social justice, to improving the life chances of the most disadvantaged people in our country, and to ensuring that those who most need help and protection continue to receive it.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848899	Profile: Iain Duncan Smith	"Do not underestimate the determination of the quiet man," Iain Duncan Smith declared as his then leadership of the Conservative Party faced grumbles in 2002.  The following year at the party's conference, he said: "The quiet man is here to stay and he's turning up the volume."  As it turned out, he didn't last that much longer as leader, but in the years that followed he bounced back to become a respected and influential figure in the party and the government.  Whatever you think of his welfare reforms, there is no arguing with their ambition, or with his passion and dedication to the brief as seen from his resignation letter to the prime minister.  Yes, there must already have been tensions, given that he was one of the handful of cabinet ministers to declare they were campaigning for the UK to leave the EU in the forthcoming referendum, against the side favoured by David Cameron.  But his resignation, at the culmination of a 48-hour post-Budget row about plans to cut back the amount being planned to be spent on a disability benefit, still came as a bolt from the blue at Westminster.  But who is Iain Duncan Smith? Here is a look at his background, written by Mary Ann Sieghart for BBC Radio 4's Profile programme in 2010.  At the 2010 Conservative Party conference, Iain Duncan Smith, the Work and Pensions Secretary, was introduced as a round peg in a round hole. The man who was a failure as party leader had at last found his niche.  His department accounted for about a third of public spending, and welfare reform was at the heart of the government's plans to tackle the deficit and balance the books.  He had not only reinvented himself, but had won the admiration of his party.  It was Iain Duncan Smith, or IDS as he is widely called, who was credited with moving the Conservative Party back to the centre ground on poverty and public services.  This was not what you might have expected from a pin-striped former Guards officer on the right of his party.  So what sort of man is he?  The Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who was his campaign manager when he became leader in 2001, points out that IDS is "not emotionally available. For someone who is so closely associated with compassion he is personally very old-fashioned you might say".  But IDS can be funny. He is a talented mimic and - as befits the youngest of five children - is happy to be teased.  But he does sometimes rub people up the wrong way.  Mr Duncan Smith, now 61, had a very stable childhood with an old-fashioned and Christian upbringing.  His father was a highly-decorated fighter pilot who downed 19 enemy planes during World War Two. His mother was a ballerina and his great-grandmother was Japanese, from Samurai stock.  His most formative memory is of watching his much-admired father with tears streaming down his face at Winston Churchill's funeral. He had never seen his father cry before.  At 14, Mr Duncan Smith was sent to HMS Conway, a boarding school on Anglesey for boys aiming to join the Navy.  Clive Plummer was a schoolmate and remembers that: "We didn't have any cleaners, so brushing parade decks, cleaning classrooms and dorms were all managed by the cadets. So in managing teams, you would make sure that not only were the most able utilised but also the less gifted.  The young Iain was not particularly academic, but he was very sporty. He won the national schools' triple jump and came second in javelin.  He later joined the Army and went to Sandhurst, but not university. Michael Mitchell met him while he was serving in Germany and says that he was not like your average Guards officer. He read widely, wrote poetry and painted.  He was also mischievous.  "He was best man at my wedding in Belgium," Mr Mitchell said.  "At Belgian weddings the bride, groom and parents have to stand in a line and receive guests for two, three hours, and I had a call of nature and asked Iain to stand in my place. And when people asked: where's Michael? He'd say - 'ooh, the last time I saw him he was walking down the road with his suitcase', or he'd say: 'Madam, are you sure you're at the right wedding?' Typical Iain - wanting to inject fun into something."  But no-one then thought he had political ambitions.  IDS left the Army against his father's wishes after just six years, and joined the defence company GEC-Marconi. His Conservative Party biography claimed he was a director, which was not correct. And his own biographical notes said he studied for a degree at Perugia University, when he only did a language course in that city.  In 1982, he married Betsy, daughter of Lord Cottesloe. They have four children.  IDS entered the Commons in 1992, in Norman Tebbit's old seat of Chingford and Woodford Green.  As a Eurosceptic, he rebelled over the infamous Maastricht treaty, knowingly risking his chance to get a promotion to government. He told his former press secretary Nick Wood: "I'll fight for what I believe and if I don't get a job - so be it."  The then Prime Minister John Major never did give IDS a job, but when William Hague became party leader he appointed the Maastricht rebel to shadow defence and then social security.  It was a surprise to everyone when he ran for the Tory leadership in 2001. It was perhaps even more of a surprise that he won, having reached the run-off by only one vote.  He defeated the runner-up, former Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, only because he was more sceptical on Europe.  He really was the accidental leader. Tim Montgomerie, who went on to run the Tory activist website, ConservativeHome.com, wrote speeches for him and eventually became his chief of staff. He says that, as leader, IDS was "completely unprepared. He had no staff, no infrastructure, no worked-out agenda".  Mr Duncan Smith knew that the Tories had to shake off the image of being the so-called "nasty" party. His response was to shift the focus towards public services - like health and education - and tackling poverty.  A formative experience was a trip to the sink estate of Easterhouse in Glasgow.  Mr Montgomerie remembers that "on that cold grey day when he visited Easterhouse and was taken round by a Baptist minister, and stopped in a stairwell where he saw paraphernalia of drug abuse next to a child's teddy - something came together.  "Something suddenly clicked," Mr Montgomerie adds. "He realised here was his personal mission and a mission for the Tory party."  His problem though, was that he was struggling to connect with the political establishment.  He did try, such as when he told the Tory conference in 2002: "There are those who do not know me yet, who will come to understand this. When I say a thing I mean it. When I set myself a task I do it. When I settle on a course I stick with it. Do not underestimate the determination of the quiet man."  Labelling himself "quiet" was not considered a masterstroke in political rhetoric.  Stuart Wheeler, then one of the Tory party's biggest donors, threatened publicly to withdraw his funding unless IDS went.  "As leader I think he was a disaster," he said.  "He lacked gravitas and came over as weak. He was a bad communicator. One read that he was high-handed with his staff and that his office was shambolic. He'd lose important papers down the back of sofas."  In the end, Mr Duncan Smith's own MPs forced him out through a vote of no confidence.  Enoch Powell once said that all political careers end in failure, but for Duncan Smith, failure came in the middle of his career instead.  For after losing the leadership, he decided to devote himself to improving the lot of the poor.  He set up the Centre for Social Justice, whose work became the cornerstone of Conservative policy on welfare reform, and which he himself is now putting into practice in government. It has already caused controversy, with opponents claiming the poor will be hardest hit by the government's spending cuts.  But it remains his belief that the best way to alleviate poverty is to get people off benefits and into work. By all accounts it was a huge surprise to him to get the call offering him the Work and Pensions Secretary job after the 2010 election.  There has always been a sense of tension between his department and the Treasury - he had to win a bruising battle with the Treasury right at the start to get the go ahead for universal credit.  The on-going effort to introduce Universal Credit has been a constant while he's been in his job. His resignation cites the "enormous strides" made but suggests that those tensions with the Treasury have been more heated than thought.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35848891	In full: Iain Duncan Smith resignation letter	Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has resigned, citing pressure to make cuts to disability benefits. Here is the full text of his letter:  "I am incredibly proud of the welfare reforms that the government has delivered over the last five years. Those reforms have helped to generate record rates of employment and in particular a substantial reduction in workless households.  As you know, the advancement of social justice was my driving reason for becoming part of your ministerial team and I continue to be grateful to you for giving me the opportunity to serve. You have appointed good colleagues to my department who I have enjoyed working with. It has been a particular privilege to work with with excellent civil servants and the outstanding Lord Freud and other ministers including my present team, throughout all of my time at the Department of Work and Pensions.  I truly believe that we have made changes that will greatly improve the life chances of the most disadvantaged people in this country and increase their opportunities to thrive. A nation's commitment to the least advantaged should include the provision of a generous safety-net but it should also include incentive structures and practical assistance programmes to help them live independently of the state. Together, we've made enormous strides towards building a system of social security that gets the balance right between state help and self help.  Throughout these years, because of the perilous public finances we inherited from the last Labour administration, difficult cuts have been necessary. I have found some of these cuts easier to justify than others but aware of the economic situation and determined to be a team player I have accepted their necessity.  You are aware that I believe the cuts would have been even fairer to younger families and people of working age if we had been willing to reduce some of the benefits given to better-off pensioners but I have attempted to work within the constraints that you and the chancellor set.  I have for some time and rather reluctantly come to believe that the latest changes to benefits to the disabled and the context in which they've been made are, a compromise too far. While they are defensible in narrow terms, given the continuing deficit, they are not defensible in the way they were placed within a Budget that benefits higher earning taxpayers. They should have instead been part of a wider process to engage others in finding the best way to better focus resources on those most in need.  I am unable to watch passively whilst certain policies are enacted in order to meet the fiscal self imposed restraints that I believe are more and more perceived as distinctly political rather than in the national economic interest.  Too often my team and I have been pressured in the immediate run up to a budget or fiscal event to deliver yet more reductions to the working age benefit bill. There has been too much emphasis on money saving exercises and not enough awareness from the Treasury, in particular, that the government's vision of a new welfare-to-work system could not be repeatedly salami-sliced.  It is therefore with enormous regret that I have decided to resign. You should be very proud of what this government has done on deficit reduction, corporate competitiveness, education reforms and devolution of power. I hope as the government goes forward you can look again, however, at the balance of the cuts you have insisted upon and wonder if enough has been done to ensure "we are all in this together".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35847611	Ministers 'to rethink' disability cuts	Planned changes to disability benefits will be "kicked into the long grass", according to a government source.  Chancellor George Osborne faced criticism over the cuts announced last week, which were likely to affect some 640,000 people.  The changes had been expected to shave £1.3bn a year off the Personal Independence Payments (PIP) bill.  "We need to take time and get reforms right and that will mean looking again at these proposals," the source said.  "We are not wedded to specific sums - it is about making sure that what will be an increasing amount of money goes to those who need it most."  The latest change applies to the formula the government uses to calculate the daily living component of PIP, which will replace Disability Living Allowance (DLA) and come into effect in January 2017.  Mr Osborne has insisted the "most vulnerable" will still be protected.  The chancellor said earlier that the overall disability budget was "going up" and that ministers would be talking to colleagues and disability charities to "make sure we get this absolutely right".  In his Budget on Wednesday, Mr Osborne said that the government would be spending an extra £1bn on disability.  However, changes to disability benefits announced a few days earlier suggested the government would save £4.4bn by 2020-21.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35847161	Week ahead	Last Wednesday's Budget Day cheers have faded, and the Chancellor faces triple trouble as the four day debate on his eighth Budget ends on Tuesday.  When the Budget resolutions are voted on, there are two amendments: both of which could well attract that rare combination of Labour, SNP, minor party and dissident Tory support that is needed to overturn the government majority.  There's a cross-party amendment calling for VAT on women's sanitary products to be zero-rated, which looks likely to be pressed even though the government believes it has secured EU agreement to allow this to happen.  Then there's a Labour amendment, signed by at least a dozen Conservatives, which would, in effect, reject a European Court of Justice ruling requiring Britain to increase VAT on home insulation and energy saving products from 5% to 20%.  There's quite a cocktail of motives behind the two amendments - feminist and green arguments, to be sure; but also an anti-EU point about control of taxes in the UK, mixed in with some gleeful manoeuvring in the undeclared race to succeed David Cameron.  The third Budget-related issue is the government proposal to change the rules on Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) - the benefit which has replaced Disability Living Allowance.  A number of Tory backbenchers including David Burrowes, the architect of the recent government defeat on Sunday Trading, have been expressing concern about the impact on vulnerable people.  This measure won't be in the forthcoming Finance Bill, and the government has now promised consultation and hinted at compromise, after a nervy couple of days which saw a rather undignified blame game played out between the Treasury and the Department of Work and Pensions, and an increasingly irritated Downing Street.  Expect Labour gloating and semi-public negotiation between ministers and Conservative backbenchers, as the Budget debate unfolds. And note that the other implication of this not being a Finance Bill measure is that it could therefore run into trouble in the Lords, (who're not able to touch finance measures) as well as the Commons.  And speaking of their Lordships' House, the government has been having a pretty rough ride there; but after some fairly gruelling sessions on the Housing and Planning Bill - including a till-they-drop committee stage day which went on until nearly midnight, it looks as if the bill is back on track and should enter report stage immediately after the Easter break, just about keeping the show on the road.  The government will be reasonably well placed to deal with outstanding differences between the Lords and Commons on its remaining legislation without too much panic or pressure, before the end of the session.  But having suffered a bruising week, with six government defeats (two on the Immigration Bill, three on the Trade Union Bill and one on a move to regret the early closing of the Renewables Obligation to small solar photovoltaic installations) ministers can't contemplate their next few weeks in the Upper House with great confidence. The majorities against the government on the Trade Union Bill varied between 88 and 148 votes, which will certainly embolden the Opposition to keep resisting.  Here's my rundown of the parliamentary week ahead:  The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions, followed by the continuation of the Budget debate.  In Westminster Hall (at 4.30pm), MPs will debate E-petition 121262 on the NHS's contract negotiations with the BMA - which has attracted 118,455 signatures. The petition accuses the Health Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, of imposing new contracts on junior doctors, "in his endeavour to destroy the NHS and privatise healthcare in the UK".  The Government response says there will be no imposition and that the aim is to introduce a fairer, safer contract, which they can do for new staff and as contracts expire as juniors move through training.  In the Lords, (2.30pm) after their usual half hour of questions to ministers, peers will deal with no fewer than three bills - a sign that the scheduling has become a little frayed.  First up is the third reading of the Scotland Bill. Normally these are quite brief exercises in rubber stamping, but there is talk of a last ditch amendment on the rather arcane issue of the "Sewell Convention" under which the UK and Scottish Parliaments pass legislative consent motions to avoid treading on each other's toes.  This is followed by the Immigration Bill, report stage, day two. Key issues will be Lord Dubs' amendment on unaccompanied refugee children, family reunion for asylum seekers, genocide and the immigration skills charge (likely to be in relation to universities and the health sector).  Finally, there will be be some further consideration of the Housing and Planning Bill including "permission in principle".  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Health questions. Then, Labour MP Wes Streeting has a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Taxi and Private Hire Vehicle Operators (Regulation) - this aims to increase training requirements for those seeking a PHV (private hire vehicle) licence, to improve safety and ensure a more level playing field between training requirements for drivers of taxis and PHVs; to switch to an "operators insurance" system where PHV companies are responsible for insuring their drivers rather than drivers individually, and to ensure multinational operators pay full taxes on money earned in the UK by closing legal 'loopholes' which enable profits to be transferred to another country.  When that is dealt with, the House moves onto the conclusion of the Budget debate - and the Budget resolutions (see above).  The adjournment debate, led by the Conservative Jake Berry is on government policy to prevent breast ironing in the UK - this is painful form of ritual body mutilation, which involves pounding and massaging the developing breasts of young girls with objects that have been heated over coals.  In Westminster Hall, there are debates on the importation of faulty electrical goods (9.30am-11am); the first anniversary of war in Yemen (11am- 11.30am); GPS satellite navigation and heavy goods vehicles (2.30pm-4pm); the persecution of Christians and other religious minorities under Daesh (4pm-4.30pm) and the Macur Review into historic child abuse - from Liz Saville Roberts (4.30pm-5.30pm).  In the Lords (at 2.30pm) peers grind on through the Housing and Planning Bill committee stage (day eight of nine) where the main issue in play will be the privatisation of the preparation of planning applications.  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Scottish questions, and at noon there is Prime Minister's Questions.  That's followed by an interesting Ten Minute Rule Bill on Cannabis (Legalisation and Regulation) from Norman Lamb, The Lib Dem former health minister believes that there is a strong public health case for regulating (and taxing) the trade rather than allowing organised crime to sell what may be very dangerous forms of cannabis.  The day's main legislating is on the HS2 Bill - aka the High Speed Rail (London - West Midlands) Bill. This is the report stage, after a gruelling two-year committee stage, in which people affected by the controversial mega-project have petitioned MPs for more compensation, changes to the route and environmental protections.  There's an amendment down from the Conservative Michael Fabricant, whose Litchfield constituency is along the route of the new line, to kill the whole bill. It is highly unlikely to be selected, and Mr Fabricant would not push it to a vote if it was (defeat would be certain given the scheme has Conservative and Labour support) but it puts his objections on the record.  Arch HS2 opponent Cheryl Gillan has a series of amendments on everything from compensation to tree planting - but her key proposal is for an adjudicator to deal with complaints during the construction process. Once approved by MPs, the bill goes to the Lords.  Next, there's a motion on "Short Money" - the funding given to opposition parties to support their parliamentary work, which pays for assorted researcher/spin doctor figures. The government had proposed major cuts, to the fury of the Opposition parties and seems to be backing rapidly down - not least because it infuriates potential Commons allies, who might be needed when their narrow majority is in danger. Expect some quiet crowing when the retreat is sounded.  There's also a slot pencilled in for consideration of any Lords amendments to bills - and after the recent defeats on the Immigration Bill and the Trade Union Bill there will have to be quite a few of bouts of "Parliamentary ping-pong" with their Lordships, in the coming weeks.  The adjournment debate, from Labour's Stephen Hepburn, is on the prosecution of construction companies for fatal accidents.  In Westminster Hall, there are debates on: the political situation in Burma (9.30am -11am); legal guardianship and missing people (11am- 11.30am); enforcement of the national minimum wage in the care sector (2.30pm- 4pm); the registration of births of children of deceased people (4pm- 4.30pm), and Hong Kong and the Sino-British Joint Declaration (4.30pm- 5.30pm).  In the Lords (3pm) there's yet more committee stage debate on the Housing and Planning Bill - but this should be the final day, allowing the bill to move to report stage after Easter.  And peers will also debate two statutory instruments on the Greater Manchester Authority and on the Tees Valley Combined Authority; after which peers rise for their Easter break.  In the Commons (9.30am) MPs open with Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling.  The rest of the day is dedicated to backbench business - first a debate on court closures - and then the debate on the Easter adjournment, in which MPs can speak about any subject that takes their fancy.  The adjournment debate is followed by an adjournment debate - in this case, former Army officer Johnny Mercer on the role of charities in the veterans' care sector.	politics

Labour said it had discovered an £800m dip in spending in Budget papers.  But a defence minister said Labour had got its sums wrong - overall spending had not gone down but money had moved from one part of its budget to another.  Labour has written to Defence Secretary Michael Fallon to seek assurances he is committed to Nato's spending target.  Shadow defence minister Toby Perkins asked about the effect of the apparent cut to spending "on our already stretched ability to respond to demands that our government places on our armed forces".  But Philip Dunne, Minister for Defence Procurement, said: "Labour have made two fundamental errors.  "Firstly, they have used the figures from the March 2015 Budget instead of the July 2015 Budget that followed the election. Secondly, they failed to include capital spending.  "The defence budget in the July 2015 Budget was £34.9bn and latest estimates are higher than that at £35.2bn.  "Thankfully, when they get the numbers wrong now, it doesn't cause the damage it did when they ran the country."  Labour stuck to its claim that the government was spending less on defence than a year ago.  Mr Perkins said: "Even if you combine the capital and current spending projections of the Budget 2016 and compare them with the next most recent budget, given at the Autumn Statement, there is still a shortfall of £200m.  "The government claim it is an 'underspend', but it is clear that this is actually the new normality that Britain's armed forces will be forced to deal with over the next few years."  The UK is currently one of only five Nato members, along with the US, Estonia, Greece and Poland, to meet the alliance's budget target - which recommends that a minimum 2% of a country's GDP be spent on defence.  Before last year's general election, David Cameron would not be drawn on whether the UK would continue to meet the target in the next few years given the scale of the public spending cuts earmarked to eliminate the deficit.  But in his July Budget, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would meet the Nato pledge on a "properly measured" basis and said overall spending on defence would be ring-fenced, getting a real terms 0.5% annual increase in its budget every year until 2020.  US President Barack Obama was reported to have warned Mr Cameron that the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35843592	Osborne under pressure from Tory MPs over disability benefit cuts	Pressure is mounting on George Osborne to rethink £4bn in cuts to disability benefits as a growing number of Tories express concerns about their impact.  Up to 640,000 people could have support for aids and appliances used for daily tasks either scaled back or removed.  One MP said Personal Independence Payments (PIP) were a "lifeline" while a minister said the policy was a "self-inflicted presentational problem".  George Osborne has insisted the "most vulnerable" will still be protected.  The chancellor said the overall disability budget "is going up" and ministers would be talking to colleagues and disability charities to "make sure we get this absolutely right".  Labour said the cuts in support, announced last week and included in the Budget, were "shameful" and they would be forcing a vote in the House of Commons as soon as possible.  The government's slender majority means they could block the plans with the support of Tory rebels and the SNP, which is also against the changes to Personal Independence Payments.  Independent peer Baroness Meacher, who led last year's opposition in the Lords to proposed tax credit cuts, told the BBC there would be "tremendous support" among her colleagues to overturn the policy.  And the Liberal Democrats, who have more than 100 peers in the Lords, said they would seek to "axe" the plans if they were approved by MPs.  Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith said the government was in "disarray" over the policy.  "Hundreds of thousands of disabled people are worried sick at the prospect of having their PIP support cut and the Tory government are only making matters worse with their spin, confusion and lies."  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan - who said on the BBC's Question Time that the PIP cuts were just a "suggestion" at this stage - has been slapped down by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith.  A source close to Mr Duncan Smith told BBC News the government was not in "concession territory".  They added: "I don't know how Nicky is explaining what she said, but she doesn't quite seem to have understood what Iain has been saying."  Quizzed about what she had meant with her Question Time comments, on a visit to Loughborough University, Ms Morgan said: "This is very much a matter for Number 10 and for the government press office and I'm not going to add anything to what I said last night."  The government wants to change the way the daily living component of Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) is calculated from January 2017.  This will see a re-evaluation of how new claimants and existing claimants who circumstances change or who are reassessed qualify for support for activities such as dressing, undressing and going to the toilet.  Government documents have indicated the change would save the government £1.3bn a year by 2020-21. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said it could result in claimants losing an average of £3,500 a year.  The government has faced intense criticism over the plans, with MPs warning they have not been properly explained and that it was mistake for Mr Osborne to announce them at the same time as Budget tax cuts for businesses and middle earners.  Johnny Mercer, the Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, said PIP was a "lifeline" for many of the most vulnerable people in society and urged ministers to proceed with care.  "I am concerned in terms of how we communicate this properly," he told the BBC's Daily Politics.  "In dealing with the most vulnerable groups in society, we need to be very, very careful and we need to work a lot harder to communicate what we are doing to these groups."  What are the proposed changes?  Recipients of PIPs are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive. Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.  The money is meant to help people cope with the extra cost of living with a disability or long-term health problem and are used to fund everything from mobility cars to adapted baths and showers.  The weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  It follows an independent review, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, which said a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having "minimal-to-no" ongoing daily living extra costs.  But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  The former soldier said ministers must explain their purpose was to eliminate "abuse and duplication" and reassure people the separate mobility element of PIP would not be affected.  "There have been veterans' charities ringing my phone ever since this came out and talking about this policy. I absolutely get that but we have to be careful about projections and what it actually means."  Former minister Dan Poulter said he had "serious concerns" while Sarah Wollaston said it was "entirely wrong" to be cutting benefits at the same time as reducing tax for middle-earners  One minister told the BBC that the way the policy had been presented to the public was flawed.  "A number of colleagues are starting to wonder if George Osborne as Chancellor has lost his touch," he said. "This is a self- inflicted presentational problem".  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled".  "The announcement made by the chancellor is a reverse of the whole trend of the past three decades, to go back to saying disabled people can't lead independent lives, can't get the support they need."  He added: "Any of us could become disabled at any time. We're just a car accident away from a major disability. We should think about that."  Disability Rights UK said thousands of people would be left "institutionalised" in their own homes if the rules were changed.  Mr Osborne rejected claims disabled people were bearing the brunt of further austerity measures, insisting the overall amount spent on disability benefits was going up.  "As Iain Duncan Smith has said, we are going to make sure that it goes to those who need our help most. So in the coming months we will be talking to colleagues, to disability charities, to make sure we get this absolutely right."  Are you currently receiving disability benefits?

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35843218	Bank of England to work with new cybersecurity body	The first task of Britain's new cybersecurity centre will be to work with the Bank of England, the government has announced.  The work will involve setting standards for the financial sector in terms of resilience to the type of cyber threats which could undermine the UK economy.  The new body - now renamed the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) - was unveiled last year by the Chancellor.  It is designed to bring the UK's cyber expertise into one place.  Ciaran Martin, currently a senior official at GCHQ, will be the NCSC's first head.  "We need to have a one-stop shop that people inside and outside government can go to," Matthew Hancock, the Minister for the Cabinet Office told the BBC, saying that the NCSC will aim to be the authoritative voice on information security in the UK.  The new centre is designed to deal with criticism of the current arrangements as too opaque.  GCHQ is the lead agency on cybersecurity but because it is a secret intelligence service based in Cheltenham, it has not always been accessible or set up to share information and communicate more broadly.  The new centre is designed to remedy that problem by having a foot in both the closed intelligence world and the public and corporate space.  The Centre will be involved in working with the Bank and other regulators in the future to set standards for parts of the private sector.  It will also work with other government departments, critical national infrastructure and the broader business community and the public.  The greater the potential risk to the country, the closer the centre is likely to be involved with a particular department or business.  In the event of future cyber breaches such as that of Talk-Talk last year, it is likely to be the Centre which acts as the focal point for communication and advice.  Those involved stress that the role of government will be to protect the country from cyber-attack and promote good practice but that the liability for any attack that does take place will still rest with whoever owns the data.  The NCSC will be based in London and is expected to fully open for business in October.  Alongside Ciaran Martin, Dr Ian Levy, currently Technical Director of Cyber Security at GCHQ, will join as Technical Director.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35840935	Tech Tent: VR, AI and eSports	On this week's edition of Tech Tent we look at two visions of the future of gaming, and we ask whether we should be worried or excited by the latest advances in artificial intelligence.  Finally, after all the hype and excitement, consumers are about to get their hands on virtual reality headsets - and we will find out whether there really is a market for this technology. Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive are both released in the next few weeks, and at the Games Developer Conference in San Francisco Sony unveiled its launch date and price.  While Playstation owners will have to wait until October to get their hands on the Sony VR headset, they will pay far less for it than for a Vive or Oculus setup. With nearly 40 million PS4 owners around the world, there's a ready-made market for Sony's offering, so by Christmas it's a fair bet that it will be the leader in VR.  Mind you, while there is now a huge amount of experimentation around VR and 360 degree video (see last week's BBC Click for example) there is still confusion about how it will be used beyond gaming. At a launch event for Nokia's Ozo 360 camera last night, I was shown a number of demos filmed with the device.  I stood next to the vocalist as a band performed, watched as a bear approached a group of nervous people at a campsite, and saw trainee astronauts learning about weightlessness in a swimming pool. The VR headset meant I could choose my own perspective on each scene, but once the novelty wore off the question remained - what is this for? Still, music producers, moviemakers and educationalists are all now producing 360 and VR material, so hopefully they will find an answer to my question.  At the end of a week where Google's AI program AlphaGo defeated a champion Go player, the artificial intelligence community is discussing what this triumph of machine over man means. I visited Microsoft's UK research lab in Cambridge where a number of artificial intelligence projects are under way , including one experiment using AI in the game Minecraft and another where a program examines scans of brain tumours.  The man who runs the lab, Chris Bishop, says it's wrong to paint a dystopian future in which machines gradually replace us as they get ever smarter. Instead he sees AI as a collaboration between humans and computers - for instance doctors using the brain tumour scanning program to assist their diagnoses rather than replacing them.  "We need to talk instead about a partnership in which machine intelligence and human intelligence work together," he says. "It's the case today, and will be the case for some time to come that the capabilities of machines, the capabilities of humans are different and complementary and if they work together they will be stronger than either of them alone."  Incidentally, for a different view, have a look at this piece from Tom Chatfield in the Guardian. He argues that in designing AI systems, we humans are making too many concessions to inflexible computers.  Back to gaming and we look at the boom in a phenomenon which is familiar to anyone under 25 but a mystery to the older generation - watching video games online. The big player in the live streaming of video games is Twitch, which was bought by Amazon 18 months ago. But we hear from a rival, Ian Sharpe, who says his Azubu streaming service has a different approach. While Twitch lets anyone become a broadcaster, playing anything from Call of Duty to Minecraft, Azubu is more focused on professional eSports.  Last week it signed a deal with the Electronic Sports League to stream exclusive content from esports tournaments - and Ian Sharpe tells us that this is going to be a new boom area for media firms looking to reach those elusive "millennials" who don't watch boring old telly.  Tune in to Tech Tent on the BBC World Service at 15:00 GMT for all that and more or catch the podcast later.	tech

Education Secretary Nicky Morgan described the plan as a "suggestion" and said it was "under consultation".  But sources close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said her comments don't "tally with what we and Downing Street are saying".  The BBC was told Mrs Morgan didn't "seem to understand" the proposals.  A number of Tory MPs have written to the chancellor urging a rethink of the £1.3bn a year cuts to spending on aids and appliances, which the government has said will affect up to 640,000 existing claimants. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has said people could lose an average of £3,500 a year.  The government wants to change the way the daily living component of Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) is calculated from January 2017, with a public consultation closing last week. Budget documents made clear it would save the government more than £4bn by 2020-21.  But ministers have faced intense criticism over the plans, with Labour and some Tory MPs threatening to derail them in the Commons.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Chancellor George Osborne had "declared war on the disabled" and he would be seeking to force a Commons vote as soon as possible.  "The announcement made by the chancellor is a reverse of the whole trend of the past three decades, to go back to saying disabled people can't lead independent lives, can't get the support they need."  He added: "Any of us could become disabled at any time. We're just a car accident away from a major disability. We should think about that."  Speaking on BBC Question Time on Thursday, Ms Morgan said that the government was "continuing the conversation" to make sure money was "going to the right people to help them with the right needs".  "First of all we've got to finish the consultation and the conversations that we're having with MPs, but also with disability groups and others, before we even bring any legislation forward.  "It is something that has been put forward, there has been a review, there has been a suggestion, we are not ready to bring the legislation forward," she said.  Fellow panel members responded with incredulity to Ms Morgan's comments, with UKIP's Roger Helmer asking: "The Budget is merely a suggestion, is it?"  And sources close to Mr Duncan Smith also played down the significance of her comments. "Listening to the Education Secretary you might have assumed we are in concession territory," the source said, adding "that doesn't tally with what we and Downing Street are saying".  They added: "I don't know how Nicky is explaining what she said, but she doesn't quite seem to have understood what Iain has been saying."  Recipients of PIPs are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive. Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.

But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  Downing Street said it would be bringing forward "legislative proposals" and, in the meantime, would continue discussions with MPs and campaigners.  Asked whether the education secretary had spoken out of turn, the PM's spokesman said she was making the point there would be dialogue but insisted the government's position has not changed.  There have been growing calls within the Conservative Party for a U-turn, with some MPs unhappy that the cuts are coinciding with plans to help middle and higher-earners by raising the threshold at which people pay 40% income tax to £45,000.  Sarah Wollaston, the chair of the Commons health select committee, said the only changes she wanted to see to disability benefits was a "refocus on those in greatest need". She tweeted: "Govt will never meet approval for change that wld reduce entitlement to #PIP at the same time as raising higher rate tax threshold".  Backbench Conservative MP David Burrowes said the proposals were a "backward step" and urged ministers to "press 'pause' on it" while Andrew Percy suggested they were more about helping the chancellor meet his self-imposed cap on overall welfare spending than reforming the benefits system.  The changes will need to be approved by both the House of Commons, where the government has a majority of 12, and House of Lords, where it has no working majority. The government was forced to abandon planned cuts to tax credits last year after they were voted down in the House of Lords.  An independent review of PIP in 2014 recommended major changes to the way it was delivered to improve how claimants are assessed and treated.  Justin Tomlinson, minister for disabled people, has defended the changes, saying there would still be an increase in the number of people claiming PIPs and that the government would be spending more on disability benefits in 2020 than it does now.  He told the BBC that although hundreds of thousands of people would be hit by the cut, many of those would not lose out completely and would still be eligible for other forms of support.  "A significant chunk of that 640,000 will continue to receive the benefit," he said.  Are you currently receiving disability benefits? What are your thoughts on the planned reforms?

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35841571	FBI warns on risks of car hacking	The FBI and the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration have added their voices to growing concerns about the risk of cars being hacked.  In an advisory note it warns the public to be aware of "cybersecurity threats" related to connected vehicles.  Last year Fiat Chrysler recalled 1.4 million US vehicles after security researchers remotely controlled a Jeep.  People who suspect their car has been hacked were told to get in contact with the FBI.  The public service announcement laid out the issues and dangers of car hacking.  "Modern motor vehicles often include new connected vehicle technologies that aim to provide benefits such as added safety features, improved fuel economy and greater overall convenience," it read.  "With this increased connectivity, it is important that consumers and manufacturers maintain awareness of potential cybersecurity threats."  It went on to offer tips to both drivers and manufacturers including:  The FBI also warned that criminals may latch on to online vehicle software updates by sending out fake messages that trick users into " opening attachments containing malicious software".  Both General Motors and BMW have recently issued security updates to mitigate the risk of remote attacks that would have allowed hackers to open doors and, in the case of GM, start the engine.  Fiat Chrysler was forced to recall millions of vehicles after Wired magazine demonstrated how hackers could remotely take control of car functions, including steering and brakes.  However, there has not yet been a real-world example of such hacking.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35840916	Government rejects minister's call to tax coffee cups	The government has slapped down a suggestion by a minister that coffee shop cups could be taxed to prevent millions of them being thrown away.  Rory Stewart told MPs there was a "huge" problem with unrecyclable, plastic-lined paper cups.  He said the plastic bag tax had been a success and a cup tax was a "very good thing to look at next".  But Mr Stewart's department Defra immediately released a statement there were "no plans" for such a tax.  Campaigners say that disposable coffee cups handed out in their billions are "virtually impossible" to recycle despite major cafe chains claiming theirs are eco-friendly.  According to some estimates, fewer than 1% of the 2.5 billion paper and plastic cups used in the UK each year are recycled, leading to criticism of High Street cafes for stamping them with recycling logos.  Answering a Commons question from Labour MP Rob Marris, Environment Minister Rory Stewart said: "It's a huge problem and there are tens of millions of these things being produced and thrown away.  "As you have pointed out, many of these things cannot be recycled either by the way they're disposed or because of the composition of the cup.  "Having tackled plastic bags, which I hope everybody in the House would agree the plastic bag tax has been a success, coffee cups seem to be a very good thing to look at next."  In October, England became the last of the UK's nations to bring in a 5p charge on plastic bags, aimed at reducing litter and environmental damage caused by retailers handing out billions of single-use carrier bags.  A Defra spokesman said: "While the minister acknowledged more needs to be done to recycle coffee cups, there are no plans to tax them."  Disposable coffee cups can be difficult to recycle because most are made with a combination of paper and plastic.  There are just two specialist facilities in the UK that have the equipment to separate the materials.  Some coffee shop chains say they work to make recycling their cups easier and offer incentive schemes to encourage consumers to use their own.  A Starbucks spokesman said: "We are working closely with industry partners to crack the difficult problem of cup recycling.  "To incentivise environmentally friendly behaviour we offer a reusable cup discount of 25p on drinks if you bring your own reusable cup to our stores. This can be any reusable cup, not only a Starbucks one."  TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall has said he is "delighted" that the problem of unrecycled coffee cups has attracted government attention.  Mr Fearnley-Whittingstall, whose #wastenot campaign has gathered more than 300,000 supporters, said Mr Stewart's intervention should "help focus the coffee companies' minds on finding a solution".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35838493	Public sector pensions change in Budget criticised	Health and education will be squeezed by more than £1bn because of changes to the way public sector pensions are funded, figures seen by the BBC show.  It comes after George Osborne announced in the Budget that employers would have to contribute more to pensions for NHS staff, teachers and the police.  He said individual pensions would not be affected.  The Treasury said employers had three years to get ready for the changes and would be helped by low inflation.  The technical changes to the way public sector pensions are valued mean departments face contributing more to their overall cost from 2019 - effectively saving the Treasury around £2bn billion a year.  As a result, Commons library figures obtained by the Liberal Democrats show, the NHS will have to find an estimated £650m per year.  The changes will also see pension contributions for teachers rise by more than £400m, the Armed Forces by more than £300m and police forces by more than £100m.  BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said some ministers had asked for clarification over how the changes would impact on their budgets, but so far there had been no suggestion the extra cost would be shouldered by the Treasury.  The health and schools budgets are protected but both are already under pressure and this decision will add to the strain, she added - and the extra cost to the NHS would wipe out the real terms increase ministers have pledged for 2019-20.  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron said the cuts were being "sneaked through" and would ultimately mean less money to spend on teachers, doctors, nurses and the police.  "It will mean the NHS, it will mean schools, it will mean the armed forces, it will mean the police," he told Radio 4's Today. "It takes that money directly out of the front line of those services."  Mr Farron said the cuts would be "intolerable" even if they served a justifiable economic purpose but Mr Osborne was acting solely to try and meet his self-imposed goal of a budget surplus by 2020. "He has chosen to set targets which are unnecessary."  Treasury officials admitted there would be an additional cost for public sector employers but they had been aware the changes were coming.  "We're committed to regular revaluation to ensure public sector pension costs are met," a spokesman said.  "The Budget announcement means employers have three years to prepare and we think they should be well placed to absorb extra cost of contributions - especially because inflationary pressures are significantly lower than expected when budgets were set at spending review."  The figures were revealed in the aftermath of the Budget as Mr Osborne faced criticism for cuts to some disability payments and questions over whether he would hit his fiscal targets.	politics

"Clan loyalties" within parts of her community saw women blocked from political office, Naz Shah, MP for Bradford West, told BBC Newsnight.  Labour said it had the best record of any of the parties in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates.  But Ms Shah said in her experience of some areas, "the kind of misogyny that exists is quite shocking".  On one occasion she was excluded from a meeting where party members agreed to look for "evidence to desecrate my character", she said.  One person had a print-out of a photograph of Ms Shah at a party which was used to suggest she drank alcohol, she said.  "Because I'm a Muslim woman who lives in Bradford, that would really be very damaging for me culturally," she said.  "It was just a picture of a friend and me at a party, and that was it - there was a bar behind, but I've not got a drink in my hand. I don't drink alcohol. But it's damaging."  She added that there were some "very dubious practices" within some wards within her constituency where there was "a higher volume of Pakistani membership. That is a fact."  "It's a culture of gatekeeping. It's a culture of power politics for the sake of having power, and that power resides with men," she said.  "It's family loyalties, it's clan loyalties, it goes back to a Pakistani model of doing things."  She said some "good guys" in the community had advised her not to challenge it, saying "they will ruin you, just back down".  But she had felt compelled to speak out because "politics needs women, and women deserve better".  "We should be transparent and open and if there is anything that we need to be doing, including an inquiry, we should be doing it," she said.  She had had the utmost support from Labour leadership, and would be meeting party leader Jeremy Corbyn soon, she added.  Newsnight has previously reported claims by Muslim women within the Labour party that they are blocked and intimidated out of local politics by cliques of men within the party from south Asian communities.  Gavin Shuker, MP for Luton South, previously told Newsnight he had felt "extremely pressured to be silent on the things I know to be true".  "I've been disappointed with the response from the Labour Party".  Last month the charity Muslim Women's Network UK wrote to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.  The Labour Party says it has been "at the forefront of the fight for women's equality". It added: "We have transformed the representation of women in politics."  "Any complaints or evidence of sexism or intimidation received by the Labour party are dealt with fairly according to our procedures and the law"	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35834142	Deal reached to scrap 'tampon tax', officials say	EU leaders have agreed a deal that will allow the UK to scrap the so-called "tampon tax", British officials say.  Two options have been put forward that would permit a zero rate of tax on sanitary products.  It comes amid the threat of a backbench rebellion following the Budget from Eurosceptic MPs over the tax, currently at the lowest rate allowed by EU law.  Chancellor George Osborne said the government "heard people's anger over paying the tampon tax loud and clear".  VAT is currently charged at the reduced rate of 5% on sanitary products - but more than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  Mr Osborne had pledged to spend the proceeds of the tax on women's charities.  "We said we'd use the money to benefit women's charities and we've already distributed £17m to good causes across the country," he said.  "At the same time we said we'd fight for agreement to reduce the VAT rate to zero, and tonight all European leaders have welcomed our plan to do just that. We've achieved what no British government has even tried to achieve.  "It just shows how Britain can make a case for a reform that will benefit millions as a powerful, confident voice inside a reformed EU."  At the European Council summit in Brussels, the 28 leaders agreed a statement welcoming "the intention of the Commission to include proposals for increased flexibility for member states with respect to reduced rates of VAT, which will provide the option to member states of VAT zero-rating sanitary products".  BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said it appeared the government had managed to avoid a Commons defeat by reaching the agreement.  A great British victory or an obvious bit of spin? Number 10 says David Cameron has come to Brussels and won the backing of all EU leaders for his plan to abolish VAT on women's sanitary products.  With the EU referendum looming, the long-running campaign to get tampons zero rated is pulling in support from Tory MPs backing Brexit. A dicey vote on the finance bill loomed next week. Now the European Commission may have defused this political problem.  For months it has been listening to EU member states complain the existing EU rules on reduced and zero-rated VAT are too rigid and past their sell by date. The UK, of course, has a particular complaint about not being allowed to cut VAT on tampons below 5% and has asked for change.  Earlier, the Commission confirmed it will publish its "Action Plan" on VAT next Wednesday. It would include two options for change that would allow countries more flexibility over VAT. Hours later, Number 10 trumpeted that a line will be included in the Council conclusions stating EU leaders welcome the Commission's move "which would provide the option to member states of VAT zero rating for sanitary products".  So at some point down the line, the government looks set to scrap VAT on tampons. The EU has moved. But it was likely to do so whether David Cameron lobbied for the move here at this summit or not.  A number of Conservative MPs have threatened to vote for an amendment to the Finance Bill in the Commons on Tuesday to allow the zero-rating of women's sanitary products.  Those campaigning for Britain to leave the EU in 23 June's referendum have been keen to highlight the role of Brussels in setting VAT rates.  Mr Cameron raised the issue with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker at the start of the EU summit, Downing Street said.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff, who has tabled the Finance Bill amendment, said: "Women's sanitary products are not a luxury. George Osborne failed to take the opportunity in his Budget to say that he would take the action called for by Labour and feminist campaigners and seek to get the 'tampon tax' abolished."  The European Commission said it was working on two options that would allow member states more flexibility over setting VAT rates.  A Commission spokeswoman said: "EU VAT rules are not imposed by the European Commission. They are decided on and agreed unanimously by member states.  "Contrary to some media reports, tampons do benefit from reduced taxation."  She added that under current rules, member states were not allowed to apply a zero VAT rate to a product unless all other member states agreed.  "Zero rates are an exception and run against generally accepted VAT principles. Most member states tax sanitary products like tampons at around 20% or more," she added.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35837692	Apple stores iCloud data with Google	It has emerged that Apple is storing some of its users' iCloud data on Google's computer servers.  Apple had previously acknowledged using Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure's rival cloud computing platforms in addition to its own data centres.  The deal is a coup for Google, which lags behind Amazon and Microsoft in the market for powering third-parties' online services.  None of the services would have access to iCloud users' records.  "The iCloud information is not at risk of being breached or otherwise observed by the ultimate owners of the platforms it resides on because of the very heavy encryption and partitioning technologies used," commented Chris Green, a tech expert at the consultancy Lewis.  The news site CRN was first to report the deal. It said Apple sealed the agreement with Google's Cloud Platform division late last year.  Both tech giants declined to comment, however the BBC was able to independently confirm the arrangement.  It may seem surprising to those who view the two companies as bitter rivals.  But Apple still puts Google as the default search engine on its mobile devices and has previously shown willingness to have business dealings with other competitors as well, not least Samsung which makes some of its components.  The news may, however, cause concern for investors in Amazon since it follows the announcements that Spotify and Dropbox recently moved operations off AWS.  Amazon, however, has played down the latest development.  "Vendors who understand doing business with enterprises respect [non-disclosure agreements] with their customers and don't imply competitive defection where it doesn't exist," it told CRN.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35834786	Michael Kors, Tissot and Nixon join the smartwatch market	Michael Kors has become the latest fashion brand to offer smartwatches.  The US firm has announced two timepieces - one targeted at each sex - powered by Google's Android Wear.  Samsung, Nixon and Fossil have also revealed new software-powered models at the Baselworld trade show. Swatch's Tissot brand unveiled its first "connected watch" too, which links up to smartphones but does not run apps.  The launches coincide with a decline in traditional watch sales.  The Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry recently reported a "steep decline" in revenues, with January's 1.5bn Swiss francs ($1.6bn; £1.1bn) representing an 8% drop on the same month's sales in 2015.  The business group has blamed a "troubled economic situation" for the fall.  However, research firm Futuresource Consulting has reported that global smartwatch shipments now outnumber those of traditional Swiss watches.  "Many consumers are still not sure how a smartwatch will benefit them in terms of lifestyle and practicality," said its report, timed to coincide with the event in Basel.  "[But] ongoing advancements by the integrated chip manufacturers means they can go smaller - which opens up the market for more petite, women's watches, effectively increasing their total available market."  Smartwatch manufacturers that use Google's Android Wear have limited ability to customise the operating system's features, so much of their efforts are focused instead on design.  Michael Kors - whose devices are manufactured by Fossil - focused on their exclusive digital watchfaces and "glamorous style" at its launch rather than on technical specifications.  Fossil also unveiled two new smartwatches under its own brand - the Fossil Q Wander and Q Marshal - which it said were slimmer than its first-generation models.  California-based Nixon, however, had one trick up its sleeve for its first Android Wear watch - the Mission. It is water-resistant to 100m (328ft) - a record for the category - and still able to accept voice commands.  That allows Nixon to target the device at surfers, who need that level of protection because of the force with which they sometimes hit the waves.  Tissot has taken a different approach with its Smart-Touch.  The watch links up to a smartphone via Bluetooth when commanded to do so and can then provide navigation directions by moving its hands.  In addition, it can use the phone to synchronise itself to the local time zone.  The watch can also trigger an alarm on a fob, with which it is sold, in order to find mislaid keys.  Another unusual feature is a solar panel - used to recharge its battery, which is said to last up to a year before it needs to be swapped out.  "Swatch Group is the only Swiss watchmaker able to do a smartwatch on its own," boasted the firm's chief executive Francois Thiebaud.  But one attendee had doubts about its chances.  "It's difficult to see how Tissot can scale this to deliver the breadth of functionality that an open platform like Android or Tizen can offer," said Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.  "Swatch's only chance for success would be to bring this functionality to its wider range of watches."  Elsewhere at the show, Samsung revealed a tie-up with the jeweller de Grisogono to release a "limited edition" version of its Gear 2 watch.  The Tizen-powered device distinguishes itself from the standard edition by featuring more than 100 black-and-white diamonds. Its price has yet to be announced.  LVMH's watch chief also provided an update on its Android-based Tag Heuer Connected watch, which was launched in November.  Jean-Claude Biver said the initial production run of 15,000 units had sold out and he expected to sell up to 50,000 more by the year's end.  "We totally underestimated demand, we were too cautious," he said.  "Next year, we'll have a real collection, a new version with six to eight models."  US manufacturer Movado has also announced plans to make more devices as part of a partnership with HP, following 2015's launch of the Movado Bold Motion.  It said it now planned to release models under the Coach, Hugo Boss, Lacoste, Juicy Couture, Tommy Hilfiger, and Scuderia Ferrari brands.  Despite all the activity, one expert said it was important not to overstate the sector's impact.  "I don't believe smartwatches have affected the high-end watch market in any appreciable way," said Ariel Adams, editor of A Blog to Watch.  "Although, I have heard anecdotally from brands that lower-end watches - $1,000 (£691) and under - are becoming affected.  "This Baselworld is all about partnerships, fashion and what I call brand cross-pollination," he added.  "It's mostly a marketing play, and I cannot find any brands here that speak fluently as to what people actually do with smartwatches and why people would want one."  Apple - which is thought to be the world's bestselling smartwatch-maker - is not exhibiting at Baselworld.  However, the firm has a press event on Monday in California where it may make related announcements.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35830452	Minister Justin Tomlinson defends 'cuts' to disability payments	The minister for disabled people has defended planned changes to support payments aimed at saving £1.3bn, amid growing calls for a U-turn.  Justin Tomlinson told BBC News there would still be an increase in the number of people claiming Personal Independence Payments (PIP).  And more money would be directed at the people who "needed it most".  Labour and some Tory MPs are threatening to derail the change, spelt out in Wednesday's Budget.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled" and Tory MP Andrew Percy said he had gone "too far" and the changes were "just not acceptable".  "This hits exactly the wrong people, potentially. I think it sends out the wrong message about the priorities of the government," he told BBC Radio 4's The World at One.  He said the changes were more about helping Mr Osborne meet his self-imposed cap on overall welfare spending than reforming the benefits system.  Mr Tomlinson told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg 640,000 people would be affected by the changes in 2020-21 - but it did "necessarily mean they will lose their benefit".  "They might lose one of the points in the assessment but a significant chunk of that 640,000 will continue to receive the benefit," he said.  He said it was a "future measure", which would only affect current claimants when they came up for reassessment.  "We will still see an increase in the numbers of people using PIP and the amount of money paid out," he added.  He said the government was committed to improving the system and that more people were receiving the payments at the highest end of the scale.  The Institute for Fiscal Studies said 370,000 people would lose out under the planned changes, with an average loss of £3,500 a year.  PIP claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week and are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive.  The money is meant to help people cope with the extra cost of living with a disability or long-term health problem and are used to fund everything from mobility cars to adapted baths and showers.  The weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  It follows an independent review, commissioned by the Department for Work and Pensions, which said a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal-to-no ongoing daily living extra costs.  But disability campaigners say the changes will make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit and prevent people hit by other benefit cuts from living independently.  Asked on BBC Breakfast about whether cuts to PIP were harming the most vulnerable in society, Mr Osborne said: "We have got to make sure we have a system that works.  "I'm always happy to listen to proposals about how improve on that but we have got to control our disability budget and make sure help goes to the people who need it most."  Labour's Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Owen Smith said: "There is no political, economic or moral justification for George Osborne's decision to cut support for disabled people while increasing tax benefits for the wealthiest, symbolising the unfairness of his Budget.  "I do not believe that those who voted Conservative at the last election did so to see a further £4 billion stripped away from people who may require assistance when washing or dressing."  He said Labour would resist any attempt by the government to push through the changes in secondary legislation, without a full debate in Parliament.  Why George Osborne has a problem with disability benefits.  1. Introducing the new Personal Independence Payment for disabled people has saved much less money than expected. There was "little evidence" for the original optimistic savings assessment says the Office for Budget Responsibility, which has repeatedly reduced its forecast.  2. More people are getting PIP than the government expected, and they are being paid more. Average awards were expected to be £86 a week. In fact they will be £100.  3, The government can boast it is spending more on disability benefits. The bill rises by about £1bn over the next five years. Had it not been for the most recent cuts it would have been yet higher - by an extra £1bn. Despite the overall bill rising individuals will see cuts to their payments.  4. The problem could get worse. Even after the latest cuts there is "considerable uncertainty" about the figures on future savings says the OBR.  5. It's a big political problem. If Mr Osborne U-turns he will have to find more than a billion pounds of savings elsewhere, and doubts about his ability to reach a surplus will intensify.  One lifelong Conservative voter, Graeme Ellis, said he had quit the party over the cuts - and made his views known on the official website of the Conservative Disability Group, on whose executive he has served.  "This website is temporarily closed owing to Disability Cuts," a message read after Mr Osborne confirmed the cuts.  "The owner of the hosting package, Graeme Ellis, has resigned over disability cuts from the group and will no longer develop or host this site."  The message was later amended to stress that no other member of the group was involved in the action and they had not known about it in advance.  Mr Ellis, a former NHS worker who has diabetes and uses a wheelchair, said Mr Osborne was "destroying lives".  "I've been a Conservative voter since I could vote. But as a lifelong Conservative I could no longer agree with what the Government's doing," he told the Mirror.  A Conservative Party spokesman said: "The Conservative Disability Group has not deactivated its website.  "The owner of the domain, who is no longer a member of the group, has deactivated it without any instruction to do so."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35836460	Short money cuts 'compromise' expected	Commons sources say the government is to propose a compromise deal on the funding opposition parties are entitled to - and put it to a vote next week.  There has been a row brewing at Westminster for some time over cuts to so-called Short money.  But sources are confident MPs will back a plan that will save 10% from the total in a vote expected on Wednesday.  Ministers say Short money payments are unduly generous given cutbacks elsewhere in the public sector.  In November, George Osborne's Autumn Statement revealed plans to cut the funding - named after former Labour MP Ted Short - by 19%, saying this would be in line with savings expected of unprotected Whitehall departments.  The plans have been strongly criticised by opposition parties.  The proposed compromise would shift the formula for calculating the payments from taking account of the Retail Price Index to instead using the Consumer Price Index.  Over the last 12 months the CPI has grown by a far smaller rate than the RPI - so the switch makes the new formula less generous.  It will necessitate what a source described as "much greater transparency" over what the money is spent on.  In addition, it will set a floor below which Short money cannot fall for the smallest parties in the House of Commons - those with between one and five MPs.  That floor is £75,000 a year. There is also a ceiling for those parties, of just over £200,000.  Between now the end of the decade sources claim the compromise arrangement will save the taxpayer around £3.5m.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35834904	A Budget conspiracy?	From time to time, you know I like to pass on some of the conspiracy theories that do the rounds in Westminster.  If that's not your bag, then please don't proceed any further, I won't take it personally.  Of course today, most people in SW1 are firmly in the Budget day two phase, quite rightly poring over the detail as think tanks and independent number crunchers get their hands on it, and in this case, as Tory backbenchers' tempers rise over some of the proposals.  But one question that remains unanswered is why did chancellor decided to undertake what's been described as the biggest ever reduction in borrowing right at the end of the Parliament to magically meet his political target?  Maybe you need a conspiracy theory to answer that.  And this time, the theories centre around George Osborne's ambitions to move into Number 10.  One minister told me, this is all about "next generation George", by pushing cuts and consolidation to the last possible moment in the Parliament.  He would therefore be trying to secure the top job when people are feeling more flush due to income tax cuts and the pain from last minute austerity hasn't yet been felt. This is "fixing the leadership when the sun is shining", they suggested.  But another source suggests something even more devilish.  It's pointless, they suggest, being bemused by the seemingly strange timing of it all.  Traditionally governments are tough on spending when they are fresh from election victory, then softer towards the end.  This time, it's the other way round.  No need for confusion though, this conspiracy implies. The simple reason is that this Parliament is never going to make it to the end of its fixed term in 2020. And that means the cuts, that pain in 2020, is simply never going to happen because there will be a general election long before. And, a different man or woman with their hands on the Red Box.  Yes, I know there is a law that makes it hard for the government to get out of the 2020 timeline - the Fixed Term Parliament Act was written under the coalition to protect its stability. But it is not at all impossible.  Some in Westminster's giant gossip chamber believe the Tory leadership is "champing at the bit" to take that chance.  The theoretical prize is an early election after the Tories have settled their leadership succession, before Labour's unhappy MPs have had the chutzpah to sort out theirs.  The argument goes, George Osborne newly installed in Number 10, doesn't have to make the big cuts, dissolves Parliament, goes to the country and beats Jeremy Corbyn's Labour to a pulp.  Try raising any of this on the record with any politician? You don't get very far.  Try raising it off the record, you don't get that far either.  But there are people who believe this conspiracy could well be the Tory leadership's dream.  There are plenty of people of course on all sides of the House of Commons who would be determined to stop them.  And conspiracies normally of course remain just that, theories that the political anoraks enjoy mulling over.  But who knows, very occasionally they can turn out to be true.  We'll have to wait rather a long time to see if this one does.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35831789	Nike restricts self-lacing trainers to app users	Nike has unveiled its much-anticipated range of self-lacing shoes.  It said the HyperAdapt trainers would be released to the public before the end of the year.  A pair of Nike-branded shoes with self-tightening laces featured in the 1989 film Back to the Future II, but it was not until 2013 that the firm started trying to make real-world versions.  In an unexpected move, the US firm has said that sales would be restricted to users of its apps.  While some might see the self-lacing function as being more gimmicky than useful, the tie-in to the Nike+ software will help the company promote other goods to those curious about HyperAdapt.  Nike+ apps are currently focused on tracking data about users' activities and offering them training programmes. But from June, the platform will introduce personalised shopping recommendations and an online store.  "Nike has lost a fair bit of traction recently to sportswear upstarts including Under Armour, which bought the MyFitnessPal app, and Asics, which has acquired Runkeeper," said Marc McLaren, online editor of Stuff, a tech-focused magazine.  "This will help keep people engaged, and we can already see from the reaction our readers are having to the announcement that they are very excited by it."  Although Marty McFly's trainers appeared to tie themselves up in the Back to the Future movie, the effect was in fact created using a prop that was bolted to the ground, below which a stagehand pulled on the laces.  Nike has achieved the effect for real by using small electric motors to adjust the laces.  These are activated when the user's heel touches a sensor.  Two buttons on the side allow the wearer to tighten or loosen the fit. A glowing component built into the sole acts as a wireless charging point, while LEDs on the back indicate how much charge remains.  Attendees at the company's Innovation Summit in New York were able to try on functioning prototypes.  The firm said the final product should need to be recharged about once a fortnight.  In time, Nike added, it intends to develop the idea further.  "Wouldn't it be great if a shoe, in the future, could sense when you needed to have it tighter or looser?" asked the trainers' designer Tinker Hatfield.  "Could it take you even tighter than you'd normally go if it senses you really need extra snugness in a quick manoeuvre? That's where we're headed."  The firm is not alone in developing self-tightening footwear.  At the CES tech show in January, French start-up Digitsole unveiled a pair of self-tightening "smartshoes" that also featured an app-controlled heater - but they have yet to go on sale.  "I think it's a canny move to get people to sign up to the Nike+ service, but if they do prove popular I'm sure the firm will open them up to a wider audience eventually," added Mr McLaren.  "But maybe that will be another year down the line."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35828339	Budget 2016: George Osborne hits back at deficit critics	George Osborne says the UK will be back in the black by 2020 as promised - provided the economy keeps growing.  The chancellor was forced to revise down his growth forecasts and admit he had missed key targets in his Budget.  He blamed global factors - but Labour said his credibility was "completely shot" and said he was cutting taxes for the wealthy at the expense of the poor.  Mr Osborne insisted on BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he was still on course to clear the deficit.  But he added the proviso that it would happen "in normal times when the economy is growing".  Paul Johnson, of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the chance of Mr Osborne hitting his target was "only about a 50-50 shot" and he would need to impose "proper" tax rises or spending cuts if there was any further downgrade in public finances.  He said the chancellor had "managed to shift quite a lot money around" to try and meet his target but he can only "get away with this once".  The IFS has said in a report that there will have to be an extra year of austerity as a result of Wednesday's Budget, with £10bn in spending cuts pencilled in for after the next general election.  "Even if we get a surplus the surplus in 2019/20 we will have to have another year of pain to stay there the following year," Mr Johnson told BBC Radio 4's The World at One..  He also questioned the chancellor's decision to freeze fuel duty, which raises about £30bn a year, for the sixth year in a row, particularly as falling oil prices had already reduced the cost of driving a car to its lowest level in decades.  "If this continues not to rise - and it is beginning to look like it will never go up again - that is a big black hole in the public finances for the medium term," he added.  The chancellor has also missed his target to get debt falling as a proportion of national income and his self-imposed cap on welfare spending.  Shadow Chancellor, John McDonnell told the BBC News Channel: "I think George Osborne's credibility is completely shot. He has missed virtually every one of his targets. People are rightly sceptical that he will now miss his surplus target."  He said Labour would spend more to grow the economy but would have the "additional discipline that you reduce debt as a portion of GDP within the 5 years".  He also criticised Mr Osborne's "morally reprehensible" £1.3bn a year cut to disability payments under the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) scheme.  He claimed Mr Osborne had "declared war on the disabled" - a charge which the chancellor denied, saying overall spending on disability was increasing and the government was making "sure we help the most vulnerable in our society".  Mr Osborne's headline grabbing announcement of a tax on sugary drinks to combat childhood obesity was welcomed by Labour.  But a Conservative rebellion is brewing over VAT on sanitary products, which is currently charged at 5%, the lowest rate allowable under EU law.  More than 300,000 people have signed a petition calling for sanitary items to be exempted from tax altogether.  In his Budget Mr Osborne said the proceeds of the tax would be distributed among women's organisations.  He has rejected calls from Eurosceptic Conservatives to defy the EU by unilaterally scrapping the tax, telling the Today programme he expected to get agreement from Brussels on it "in the next few days".  Prime Minister David Cameron is set to raise the issue "on the margins" of a summit he is attending in Brussels, Downing Street said.  Labour MP Paula Sheriff has, meanwhile, tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill that would scrap the so-called "tampon tax". Labour will back the motion, which it said was attracting cross-party support.  With three months until the referendum on the UK's EU membership, the chancellor also used his Budget speech to warn against voting to leave.  He quoted a line from an Office for Budget Responsibility report which said there appeared to be "a greater consensus that a vote to leave would result in a period of potentially disruptive uncertainty while the precise details of the UK's new relationship with the EU were negotiated".  Leave campaigners, including London Mayor Boris Johnson and Commons Leader Chris Grayling, have dismissed claims there would be years of uncertainty as scaremongering.  Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote told the BBC's Newsnight programme the organisation had not done any projections about the implications of a Brexit - and the chancellor was wrong to imply it had.  A number of economists had said there could be a period of uncertainty which could have implications for financial markets, which the report cited, "but we made no explicit judgement ourselves", he said.  The chancellor has staked his reputation on his economic credibility, even imposing a set of tight fiscal targets on himself. So far he's missed two; cutting debt as a proportion of GDP this year and capping welfare spending.  Now economic analysts warn he could struggle to meet his most coveted - a budget surplus by the end of the Parliament.  Today the Institute for Fiscal Studies will focus on the chancellor's ability to clear the deficit - particularly in light of changing economic forecasts and downward revisions in growth.  Mr Osborne said he was taking difficult decisions to provide long-term stability for the next generation.  He found money to cut income tax and business rates, help savers and invest in roads and schools - but some in the chancellor's own party are questioning his decision to cut disability payments.  And Eurosceptic MPs are threatening to rebel unless the government listens to calls to abolish tax on sanitary products - which is set by the EU.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35832197	Miitomo: Nintendo launches first smartphone game in Japan	Nintendo has released its highly-anticipated debut smartphone game, Miitomo, in Japan.  The app is a social game in which players create an avatar known as a Mii and share posts with friends from Facebook and Twitter.  Players are encouraged to answer questions about their likes and dislikes and the answers can be seen by friends in the app.  Early reviews of the app have been mixed.  Video game site IGN said Miitomo had "a lot of potential" but had "missed opportunities with the lack of room customisation".  Technology site The Verge said Miitomo was "a little clunky at times, with too many load screens" but did have an abundance of "sleek, appealing quirkiness".  But the first 500 reviews on the Japanese version of the iOS app store have been positive.  Nintendo first announced its intention to produce smartphone games in March 2015, after widespread demand for its best-selling franchises to be made available on mobiles.  Miitomo lets players dress up their avatar with Nintendo-themed accessories and share pictures of their Mii with friends.  "It's a new kind of social network, and it's quite strange," said Alex Olney, a games journalist at Nintendo Life.  "You are questioned by the app about what you did at the weekend and what food you like and the answers are relayed to your friends. It's strangely engrossing."  Although the game offers in-app purchases, where players can part with real cash to buy in-game currency, Mr Olney said he felt like the app was more likely to be a "gateway" into the Nintendo ecosystem.  "It links to a Nintendo account and Miitomo can be used to get rewards. Save enough and you might get a discount or free downloadable content for a console game," he told the BBC.  "It gets people on to their platform - a gateway into the wider Nintendo world."  Nintendo's social software has not always been a success. In 2013, it closed the Letterbox messaging service on its 3DS console over concerns people were sharing indecent images on the platform.  Despite the closure, Mr Olney said Miitomo did not have content filters built into it.  "There is no language or photo filter, it is something we brought up with them," he told the BBC.  "But it is a closed circle of friends - you can't add people just by email address, you have to be friends with them on Facebook or follow one another on Twitter. And you can report content you find inappropriate."  Miitomo, which is expected to be released in the UK in March, is the first of five mobile games Nintendo is producing with Japanese firm DeNA.  In January, Nintendo's president Kimishima Tatsumi said he hoped to use some of the firm's famous characters in smartphone games in the future.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35831783	Fashion firm rebuked over Instagram ads by US watchdog	A US fashion firm has settled a case in which it was accused of failing to flag paid Instagram endorsements as being adverts.  Lord & Taylor had been charged with paying 50 "influencers" to post photos of themselves on the same weekend in March 2015 wearing one of its dresses.  The US trade regulator said the company had failed to disclose it had provided the dresses for free and paid each person thousands of dollars.  The firm did not admit wrongdoing.  However, as part of the settlement, it has agreed that in the future any influencers it uses must disclose they have been paid.  It marks the first case of its kind since the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) published guidelines for so-called native advertising last year.  The regulator's complaint said that Lord & Taylor's paid-for Instagram posts reached 11.4 million users over two days and led to its Paisley Asymmetrical Dress "quickly" selling out.  It noted that the "influencers could style the dress any way they chose", but had to include the company's Instagram account handle and use its hashtag - actions that helped the images go viral.  "The company also pre-approved each proposed post," the FTC added.  "In addition... Lord & Taylor did not require the influencers to disclose that the company had compensated them to post the photo, and none of the posts included such a disclosure."  The watchdog also complained that Nylon, a fashion news website, had also posted a photo of the dress on its Instagram account with a caption that Lord & Taylor had reviewed and approved, in addition to a "seemingly objective article" about the piece of clothing, neither of which indicated that they were paid-for ads.  Although the FTC has the power to impose a penalty of up to $16,000 (£11,140) for any such violation, Lord & Taylor has not been fined.  However, it has agreed to establish a monitoring and review programme for future endorsement campaigns and must report back to the FTC about its implementation.  The UK's Advertising Standards Authority has already taken action of its own against social media product placements.  In 2014, it reprimanded Oreo-maker Mondelez for contacting vloggers to promote its biscuits without revealing they had been paid to do so.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35828335	Peers defeat trade union funding reforms	The government has been heavily defeated in the House of Lords over trade union reforms Labour fears will cost it millions of pounds in funding.  Ministers want to require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party.  But peers voted by 320 to 172 to apply the changes to new members only and with a 12-month transition period.  Business Minister Baroness Neville-Rolfe said the change was not aimed at Labour Party finances.  The vote on political levies was one of three defeats for the government's Trade Union Bill.  Peers also voted to commission an independent review of electronic balloting for industrial action - which ministers have rejected - and against a cap on the amount of paid time public sector workers can spend on trade union activity.  Trade unions' political funds can be used for political campaigning and to make donations.  If an opt-in is introduced, Labour believes three million fewer members of the biggest unions would agree to pay into them, costing it £6m.  In January, peers voted to set up a cross-party committee so the proposals were more closely examined.  The committee concluded the changes should only apply to new members of a trade union, not existing ones.  Its chairman, crossbencher Lord Burns, said the Conservative manifesto had been "loosely worded" on the matter, and said the amendment did not break the government's manifesto commitment to introduce a "transparent opt-in process for union subscriptions".  "It avoids the trap of being drawn into a war on political funding," Lord Burns said.  The committee also said the issue of existing members opting-in to the political levy should be considered as part of a wider review into party funding.  Labour's Baroness Smith of Basildon said the government's plans were designed to make opting in as difficult as possible to have a negative impact on Labour.  "It will have a disproportionate, unnecessary impact on trade union political funds," she said.  But Lady Neville-Rolfe said she did not understand why opt-in should apply to new members but not existing ones as she described the committee's recommendation as a "wrecking amendment".  "It is not acceptable in many areas of daily life to automatically deduct payment for a cause that has not been actively consented to," she added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35813973	Sugar tax surprise in Budget	George Osborne has unveiled a tax on sugary drinks in a wide ranging Budget dominated by gloomier growth forecasts.  The chancellor blamed the slowdown on a "dangerous cocktail" of global risks and said the UK had to "act now so we don't have to pay later".  He announced an extra £3.5bn in spending cuts - and sparked controversy by warning of the risks of EU exit.  But Labour contrasted a lowering of corporation tax with cuts to disability payments.  The £530m raised by a tax on the sugar content of soft drinks - the equivalent of about 18-24p per litre, the government says - will be spent on primary school sports in England, with the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland free to decide how to spend their share.  Mr Osborne's sugar tax announcement sparked a big fall in the share price of soft drinks makers but it was welcomed by TV chef Jamie Oliver, who has been campaigning for such a move.  The tax will be levied on the volume of the sugar-sweetened drinks companies produce or import.  The Office for Budget Responsibility says it could result in a "pretty substantial price rise" on products - as much as 80% on, for example, a two-litre bottle of own-brand cola.  There will be two bands - one for total sugar content above 5 grams per 100 millilitres; a second, higher band for the most sugary drinks with more than 8 grams per 100 millilitres, with the levels yet to be set.  Examples of drinks which would currently fall under the higher rate of the sugar tax include full-strength Coca-Cola and Pepsi, Lucozade Energy and Irn-Bru, the Treasury said. The lower rate would catch drinks such as Dr Pepper, Fanta, Sprite, Schweppes Indian tonic water and alcohol-free shandy.  BBC health editor Hugh Pym said the tax had come as "a bolt from the blue" - particularly as Downing Street had opposed the idea last autumn. It was attacked at the time by some Conservative MPs as "nannystate-ism".  Read more about how it will work  How has Osborne's spoonful of sugar tax gone down?  In his biggest Parliamentary test to date, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn delivered the Opposition's response, describing Mr Osborne's Budget as "the culmination of six years of his failures" which had "unfairness at its core".  The Labour leader said the financial proposals failed on productivity, investment and in tackling inequality - and gave tax cuts to the wealthy while disabled people lost more than £1bn.  But he welcomed Mr Osborne's sugar tax, which will be introduced in two years' time and will not apply to fruit juices or milk-based drinks.  Announcing the move, Mr Osborne said: "I am not prepared to look back at my time here in this Parliament, doing this job and say to my children's generation: 'I'm sorry - we knew there was a problem with sugary drinks. We knew it caused disease. But we ducked the difficult decisions and we did nothing'."  Mr Osborne said the UK was still on course to clear its deficit by 2019/20 thanks to the extra spending cuts.  But in a move that has angered Conservative colleagues who want the UK to leave the EU, he cited the Office for Budget Responsibility's view that the UK would be "safer, stronger and more secure" if it remains in.  Tory MP and Leave campaigner David Davis said: "The real risks for Britain lie in remaining within the EU."  Mr Osborne's package includes a £1.5bn plan to turn all state schools into academies.  In other Budget announcements, Mr Osborne committed £300m for transport projects, although almost half of the money committed was announced in the Autumn Statement.  The lower growth forecast from 2.4% to 2% in 2016 was driven by a reduction in the OBR's productivity forecasts.  The OBR also said the government was going to breach its own welfare cap in every remaining year of this Parliament.  The additional spending is mainly caused by more people than expected being eligible for disability benefits, with the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) scheme costing £3bn more than expected in July.  Cuts aimed at saving £1.3bn were announced last week.  There will be new action to tackle overseas retailers who store goods in Britain and sell them online without paying VAT - and new tax free allowances for "micro entrepreneurs" who rent their homes or sell services through the internet.  Reforms to business rates will mean 6,000 small businesses pay no rates and 250,000 have their rates cuts from April 2017, said Mr Osborne.  He announced a major overhaul of the North Sea tax regime aimed at helping the UK's oil and gas industry, effectively abolishing the Petroleum Revenue Tax.  The SNP's deputy leader Stewart Hosie welcomed the move - but criticised the overall Budget package, saying Mr Osborne had "failed to tackle the debt, the deficit and the borrowing as he promised" and urging him to abandon austerity and invest more in growth.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35823392	Can Osborne defy political history?	Hold your nerve - you can cut public spending for ten years, and keep voters on side.  Hold your nerve - you can keep your credibility despite missing target after target, even breaking your own self-imposed rules.  Hold your nerve - you can promise tax cuts for millions of workers despite a much bleaker picture in the world economy.  Hold your nerve - you can make big reforms despite a small majority.  Political history tells us ALL of that cannot be true. But as ever, George Osborne hopes, that precedent may not apply to him.  Despite expectation, this Budget was not dull, it was not timid.  The chancellor heralded bold changes that will change people's lives, and the terms of business for many thousands of firms - that tax on sugary drinks a surprise, perhaps designed to distract from the worse economic picture, dragging productivity and bleaker numbers.  There were vows too of higher tax thresholds, more powers moving from Whitehall, a totally new alternative to pensions. There's no question the chancellor wanted to show that he and the government have not run out of ideas.  But none of that can hide the big truth. The country is now expected to be less well off for years, to grow more slowly, even if ahead of our rivals.  We are less prosperous than the chancellor told us in November, and will be for some time.  What we are asked to believe is that then, suddenly, as if by magic, money will flow back to lead us into the black just before the next general election.  Like with all Budgets, there is nothing remotely certain about this coming to pass.  But the outline of that promise more than hints at the chancellor's own long-term aspirations.  That if he holds his nerve, he can follow David Cameron into Number 10 - despite the mistakes and miscalculations of recent months.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35825091	Budget 2016: How has Osborne's spoonful of sugar tax gone down?	One of the major talking points following this year's Budget is the introduction of a new tax on sugary soft drinks to tackle childhood obesity.  The £530m raised by a levy on the sugar content of soft drinks will be spent on primary school sports, according to Chancellor George Osborne.  There was mixed reaction to the new levy with some sweet on the idea, but others slightly more bitter.  In the immediate hours after the Chancellor delivered his Budget, the hashtag #Budget2016 was tweeted an estimated 175,000 times, while the search term "sugar tax" was used around 14,000 times on the social media platform.  Some referred to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's Opposition response, where he welcomed Mr Osborne's sugar tax but said the Budget overall had "unfairness at its core".  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver - an exponent of healthier diets, particularly among children - quickly posted his reaction on Instagram which got over 40,000 likes.  Again, the reaction in turn to the celebrity campaigner's tweet was both sweet and sour.  Meanwhile, the exact sugary drinks to be affected became an issue in itself with some choosing to focus on the various - political and non-political - implications for the brands in question and their loyal customers.  Many were also quick to notice the fact - crucially for some - that while a tax had been placed on sugary beverages, beer and cider duty were left alone, along with any levy on whisky and other spirits.  Clearly an issue that affects all ages and lifestyles, then - regardless of their political persuasion.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35823383	Budget 2016: Jeremy Corbyn attacks Osborne's 'failure'	Jeremy Corbyn said the Budget had "unfairness at its very core" as he responded to George Osborne.  The Labour leader said the chancellor's statement was "a Budget of failure" on the deficit, investment and inequality.  He attacked cuts to disability benefits and criticised "mate's rates" corporate tax deals - but welcomed a new levy on sugary drinks.  Mr Osborne also announced extra spending cuts of £3.5bn and an increase in the higher tax threshold.  He said his Budget - which also includes forcing all state schools to become academies - "puts the next generation first".  But Mr Corbyn said only a Labour government could "harness the enthusiasm" of young people.  He said Mr Osborne's Budget was "the culmination of six years of his failures" accusing him of presiding over low productivity, investment and ambition, and failing to show a "real commitment" to ending inequality.  Despite the "rhetoric" of the Northern Powerhouse, Mr Corbyn said, there was "systematic under-investment in the North" and the government had "stood by as the steel industry bled".  He also attacked the government's record on home ownership, saying a generation had been "locked out" by its policies.  With some pollsters suggesting his own personal ratings are lower than any Labour leader since Michael Foot three decades ago, it was perhaps brave of Jeremy Corbyn to make failure the theme of his budget response.  Certainly it drew derision from the Conservative benches and the deputy speaker had to intervene several times to calm the atmosphere.  The Labour leader accused Chancellor George Osborne of "six years of failure" - failing to meet his own targets to balance the books and to rebalance the economy.  "The gulf between what the Conservative government expects from the wealthiest and what it demands from ordinary British taxpayers could not be greater," he said.  "The 'mate's rates' deals for big corporations on tax deals is something they will be forever remembered for.  "This is a chancellor who has produced a Budget for hedge fund managers more than for small businesses."  In his Commons address Mr Osborne, who promised a £10.4bn surplus by 2019-20, aimed a joke at Mr Corbyn, the Islington North MP, saying the proposed Crossrail 2 rail link was "good for people in North London who are heading south".  He also revised down growth forecasts, warned of the risks of an EU exit, and announced a £115 million package to help rough sleepers.  Responding to the homelessness announcement, John Healey, Labour's housing spokesman, said he welcomed the fact that Mr Osborne had "finally woken up to the fact there's a problem".  But he said five times as much had been cut from housing support in November's Spending Review.	politics

Certainly it drew derision from the Conservative benches and the deputy speaker had to intervene several times to calm the atmosphere.  The Labour leader accused Chancellor George Osborne of "six years of failure" - failing to meet his own targets to balance the books and to rebalance the economy.  And that F word was deployed time and again. George Osborne, he argued, had also failed on investment, productivity and tackling inequality,  In the Commons chamber, the Conservative chair of the Treasury Select Committee Andrew Tyrie acknowledged that it is the most difficult task an opposition leader faces - responding to a detailed budget of which he has no advance sight.  So a decision seemed to have been taken in advance by Labour's upper echelons to take a relatively risk-free approach, and denounce the things that were obviously going to be in the Budget rather than respond to the detail - though there was a welcome for the "surprise" sugar tax announcement.  Lower forecasts for growth were compared to the "lofty rhetoric" of the chancellor in past statements when he promised "a march of the makers".  And not for the first time austerity was criticised as a "political choice" - a point Jeremy Corbyn had made during the Labour leadership campaign and which was aimed at his internal as well as external opponents.  There was strident criticism in his speech of government cuts in personal independence payments for people with disabilities while corporation tax was being cut.  But there was no attempt to emulate the jaw-dropping response to the Autumn Statement last year - when the shadow chancellor and close Jeremy Corbyn ally John McDonnell produced a copy of Chairman Mao's little red book.  It was an attempt at political satire - highlighting the sale of British assets to a big foreign government and the chancellor's attempts to get more infrastructure investment from a country with a less than salubrious human rights record.  But it fell flat when the chancellor parried the attack by suggesting his left-wing opposite number was waving around his own "signed copy" and had sent shadow cabinet members to "re-education camps".  The whole episode meant less attention was devoted to a government u-turn on tax credits.  But there was a price - albeit a smaller one - to be paid by taking a more cautious route this time around. As the old adage goes, it's better to be talked about than not talked about.  Jeremy Corbyn's speech lacked focus at times, and wasn't exactly full of light and shade - often delivered in the same tone of voice. Some on his own frontbench were more distracted by their phones and texts than by his rhetoric.  Some on the backbenches quite simply chatted.  And perhaps because the Chamber was so full, some Labour MPs watched him from the gallery above. The line-up was a bit like a frontbench in exile, full of people who range from being mildly to extremely sceptical of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership in public or private.  As one former minister put it: "There was a good opening paragraph in his speech on Osborne's failure to hit his own targets but then he wasted the rest of it with a predictable list of cuts he didn't like. Apart from everything else he has no self discipline so can't stick to one key point."  Another former frontbencher put it more bluntly: "There was no coherent message and no credibility." A newer MP was more positive, praising a "good effort".  But it's unlikely the parliamentary party were the Labour leader's target audience.  As one of his MPs put it privately: "He wasn't light footed enough to respond to the government announcements and focused on "our people" as always. But it will warm the cockles of the Corbynistas."  And with rumours of a possible challenge to his position abounding at Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn did nothing to make his position less secure amongst grassroots party members and supporters who like his dividing lines with the government and who will vote in any leadership contest.	politics

Earlier in March, The Times suggested trials would take place on a "quiet stretch" of the M6 motorway in Cumbria in 2016.  The government has now confirmed "lorry platooning" trials, in which vehicles form a convoy headed by a driver in the leading lorry, will go ahead.  It also announced that driverless cars will be trialled on UK roads by 2017.  In the Budget, published on Wednesday, the government said it wanted the UK to be "a global centre for excellence in connected and autonomous vehicles".  Companies such as Ford and Google have been testing autonomous cars for months, but trials typically take place in California.  Edmund King, president of roadside recovery firm AA, has questioned the feasibility of a lorry platooning scheme in the UK.  "The problem with the UK motorway network is that we have more entrances and exits of our motorways than any other motorways in Europe or indeed the world," he said earlier in March.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33008257	Small drone risks to aircraft 'minimal'	The risk of a small, consumer drone significantly damaging an aircraft is 'minimal', suggests a study.  It used data on bird strikes to get a sense of what would happen if a small drone collided with a plane.  Only 3% of collisions between aircraft and birds similar in weight to domestic drones result in damage, found the George Mason University researchers.  An even smaller number caused injuries to humans, it found, and many of these were caused by flocks of birds.  The research project was prompted by the recent introduction of rules in the US that make owners of drones weighing more than 250g register their craft with the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).  "Contrary to sensational media headlines, the skies are crowded not by drones, but by fowl," wrote Eli Dourado and Samuel Hammond in an article summarising their research.  US airspace is home to about 10 billion birds, said the researchers, but collisions between fowl and aircraft have remained rare.  The pair analysed 25 years of data gathered by the FAA on bird strikes to determine what damage a drone might do.  Of the 160,000 bird strikes recorded since 1990, 14,314 caused damage, revealed the analysis. About 80% of the damage was done by birds such as turkey vultures and geese, which significantly outweigh domestic drones.  About 97% of the strikes that involved small birds did no damage to the aircraft they hit, said the researchers.  "Given the voluntary nature of strike reporting, the true percentage of strikes causing damage is probably much lower, as strikes that do not cause damage can be either missed or under-reported," they wrote.  The researchers did point out that because birds and drones are made of different materials, more damage might occur if a drone hits a plane. It urged the FAA to carry out research to determine the likely damage.  While there have been wildlife strikes that did cause fatalities, none involved a bird that was similar in size to a domestic drone, they said.  If drones collided with planes in the same proportion as birds do - roughly one bird in one million - then it could be a long time before any drone-aircraft impact does damage, they said.  "One damaging incident will occur no more than every 1.87 million years of 2kg [drone] flight time," said the researchers. Fatal incidents will be even rarer.  "This appears to be an acceptable risk to the airspace," they concluded.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35821276	BBC, MSN hit by malicious ad attack	Several large websites have been hit by an attack that made them display malicious adverts that led to some visitors being infected with ransomware.  Sites hit included MSN, BBC.com, the New York Times, AOL, Newsweek and several others.  The malicious adverts were piped to the sites via four separate ad networks, say security researchers.  The attack was aimed mainly at people browsing these sites in the US.  Reports from three security companies detailed the attack that sought to get its malicious adverts displayed on more than 13 separate sites, many of which have millions of visitors every day.  Analysis by Trustwave researchers suggested the attack managed to put ads on so many sites because the perpetrators behind it gained ownership of a web domain that used to supply legitimate adverts.  The former owners of this domain did not renew it in January, letting it fall into the hands of the criminals.  "This provides them with high quality traffic from popular websites that publish their ads directly," wrote Daniel Chechik, Simon Kenin and Rami Kogan in a blogpost.  Researchers at Malwarebytes and Trend Micro found several other domains being used to supply the booby-trapped adverts.  The ad networks involved have been informed about the malicious adverts they are inadvertently supplying. Some have already taken steps to stop the malicious adverts popping up.  Anyone clicking on a malicious advert was taken to a separate page that attempted to infect them with either a variant of ransomware known as Cryptowall, or a trojan that gave attackers remote access to their computer. Both attacks only worked against Windows computers.  To avoid falling victim to future attacks, people should uninstall potentially unsafe programs such as Flash, Java and Microsoft's Silverlight, that cyber thieves regularly exploit, said the security firms. In addition, they said, users should make sure they keep their web browsers up to date.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35820872	Apple: 'US Founders would be appalled'	Apple has called the US government's request to help it unlock an iPhone a "stretch" of the law and said America's founding fathers would be "appalled".  The US Department of Justice (DOJ) has ordered Apple to help unlock an iPhone used by San Bernardino gunman Rizwan Farook.  But Apple has continued to fight the order, saying it would set a "dangerous precedent".  The case will be heard in a federal court on 22 March.  Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the Californian city last December before police fatally shot them.  The FBI wants to access data on Farook's iPhone but the device is encrypted and can only be unlocked by entering the correct Pin code.  Guessing the code incorrectly too many times could permanently wipe the device, so the FBI has asked Apple to develop a new version of its operating system that circumvents some of its security features.  Apple has repeatedly stated that creating a compromised version of iOS would have security implications for millions of iPhone users and would set a precedent.  The FBI's court order refers to a 1789 law called the All Writs Act, which can give courts the power to force companies to cooperate in a criminal investigation.  But in its latest response, Apple said the DOJ was using the law to "resolve a policy and political issue".  "According to the government, short of kidnapping or breaking an express law, the courts can order private parties to do virtually anything the Justice Department or FBI can dream up.  "The Founders would be appalled."  But the FBI has said encryption could make smartphones "warrant-proof".  On 1 March, FBI Director James Comey said: "From the founding of this country it was contemplated that law enforcement could go into your house with appropriate predication and oversight.  "To me the logic of that means they wouldn't have imagined any box or storage area that couldn't be entered.  "It's so seductive to talk about privacy as an ultimate value in a society where we aspire to be safe, and have our families safe and our children safe — that can't be true, we have to find a way to accommodate both."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35204921	Could hackers turn the lights out?	For a long time computer security experts have warned about the threat hackers pose to the systems that help control the power stations, water treatment plants and transport systems we rely on.  Just before Christmas, that theoretical threat become all too real for more than 225,000 Ukrainians who were plunged into darkness by a sophisticated attack on one of the nation's power companies.  The attackers struck late in the afternoon on 23 December and used the remote access they had gained to computers in the control centre of power firm Prykarpattyaoblenergo to flip circuit breakers and shut down substations.  In total, about 30 substations were turned off, including those that served one of the control rooms for Prykarpattyaoblenergo, so staff struggling to get the lights back on were forced to find a fix in the dark.  Even now, months after the attack, computer systems at the Ukrainian energy company are not quite fixed because the "Killdisk" malware used in the attack deleted key files.  It would have taken significant time and effort to carry out this sophisticated attack, said Stephen Ward, a senior director at security firm iSight Partners, which has analysed the sequence of events leading up to the attack.  The good news is that remotely shutting down power stations or similar infrastructure systems is really hard, he said.  "To make something happen on any of these systems you have to gain information to understand their processes. Those processes are completely different from industry to industry and even facility to facility.  "The basic software may be the same but you have to write the logic to control and create the process and that's unique to the installation itself," said Mr Ward.  That was certainly true in Ukraine. Reports into the attack reveal that the hackers behind it spent months inveigling their way into Prykarpattyaoblenergo's computer systems so their co-ordinated strike would be as effective as possible.  The gang behind the Ukraine attack got in by tricking key staff into opening booby-trapped attachments on email messages crafted to look like they came from friends and colleagues.  But, said security expert Sergey Gordeychik, there are other ways to get at industrial control systems (ICS).  Mr Gordeychik helps co-ordinate Scada Strangelove - a community of security researchers who seek out ICS systems openly exposed online. Scada (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems are used to oversee plant and machinery in industrial installations.  "We can discover more than 80,000 different kinds of ICS systems connected to the internet directly," he told the BBC.  That's bad, he said.  "If we are trying to compare the standard security of the logic controllers found in ICS systems with Windows or Apple laptops, it's like Windows 95," he said. "They are like a desktop operating system 10 years ago when the level of security was very low."  Scada Strangelove's scanning work to find these vulnerable systems has got many of them taken offline, said Mr Gordeychik. For example, he said, work that the group did on net-connected rail control systems means many of them are now inaccessible.  Its work has also prompted some hardware makers to update the software controlling their equipment to make it more secure. Some have even gone as far as uploading it to their devices to harden them even if customers do not ask for it.  Despite these successes, Mr Gordeychik said the group was not set up solely to police these vulnerable systems.  "The main idea is not trying to remove systems case-by-case," he said. "The main idea is to raise awareness and to force vendors to create more secure-by-design systems."  That might be tricky, said Ian Glover, head of the Crest organisation that certifies ethical hackers for work on corporate and government networks.  Crest is currently carrying out research on the security of the computerised parts of the UK's infrastructure. The report is a survey of security practices at those essential plants and organisations to see if the ethical hackers who probe the digital defences will need new skills to make sure they find all potential bugs and vulnerabilities.  What had been a surprise, said Mr Glover, was the attitude of many companies who run the nation's infrastructure.  "That's what's been most disturbing to me," he said. "That people did not think they were going to be attacked."  This despite the fact that many security firms that investigate data breaches frequently find evidence that criminals and state-backed hackers are lurking in the networks.  But that danger to the systems directly connected to the net should not be overstated, said Ben Lowater, deputy director for Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) at GCHQ, the UK's intelligence and security base.  "The single biggest vulnerability is connecting poorly protected enterprise IT to operational technologies," he said.  Operational technologies (OT) refers to the machinery in the field or on an industrial plant that keeps a process going or helps manage that remote installation.  "The vast majority of attacks actually go after the enterprise IT and then will act as if they were a legitimate user to get the ICS or OT to do something," he said.  There were good reasons why attackers chose this route, he added.  "It's much easier to exploit the enterprise IT because there are so many tools you can download and use to do that," he told the BBC.  A firm with good defences against the threats that are aimed at its corporate systems will also help to defeat attempts to subvert that remotely operated plant and machinery.  GCHQ regularly advised the companies running the various parts of the UK's national infrastructure on better ways to organise their digital defences. And sometimes, he said, it helped them get ahead of potential attacks.  "As we go about prosecuting our intelligence mission and function if we get information about a threat to the CNI we will pass it on to the relevant company," he said.  These rare incidents showed that the threat to CNI was real and that there were people with the capability to launch cyber-attacks on the UK's national infrastructure. In addition, he said, there was no doubt that other groups had the intent to do the UK harm.  "Should we be worried? Yes," he said. "There are people with the capability. There are people out there with the intent. But at the moment we are not in the position where we are seeing groups with both the intent and capability.  "We are doing all we can to harden the UK should these two things, capability and intent, come together."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35818167	No longer the 'lucky chancellor'?	If George Osborne was the "lucky chancellor" in November when the Treasury found an extra £27bn down the back of the Commons green benches, what will he be today?  How does he respond practically and politically to the fact that the numbers he based his plans on at the Spending Review have turned out to be wrong?  And not just those numbers, but much of the case that he'd been building in the year before feels, well, misplaced, now - that we were on our way "out of the red and back into the black", he had "fixed the roof" while the sun was shining, whichever Osborne metaphor you want to choose.  As my colleague Kamal Ahmed's written here, the backdrop is different. So first, George Osborne is going to have to fess up - the pages and pages of numbers the independent Office for Budget Responsibility provided as the basis of his sums won't add up anymore.  We know too - as he told me a few weeks ago - that means extra government cuts are likely, probably an additional £4bn billion a year by 2020.  So more cuts are on the way, on top of six years of spending reductions that have hit some families extremely hard.  But the government's announcement today on academy schools, and the fact the chancellor, not the education secretary, is making it, suggests something else too.  Numbers 10 and 11 are determined to make us believe they are interested in much more than just sorting out the books - they're not just cutters, but reformers too.  Even though those plans will cause strong complaint, they are part of George Osborne and David Cameron's plans to achieve more than just close the gap between what the government spends and takes from all of us in taxes - although they know that's proving hard enough.  And while the numbers are certainly worse than Number 11 had hoped, and the catchily-titled "downward revisions" will grab many of the headlines, George Osborne's political brain may tell him that economic changes have not knocked the (notoriously unreliable) predictions so far off course that it is worth any enormous deviation from his overall strategy.  So the chancellor, albeit in rather more sombre tones, is likely to echo his previous audacious claims that a Conservative government that is making significant cuts to state spending is composed of "the mainstream representatives of the working people".  He has been doing the job for six years now, and knows the dangers of a Budget that goes wrong, and one that goes with a bang. But with the Conservatives' ambitions, and his own, in mind, he is unlikely to miss the opportunity to make that case again.  Despite the shadow chancellor's new credo that aligns his hypothetical plans for tax and spend closely to those of Labour's recent past, even before George Osborne is on his feet John McDonnell is demanding that he stop the cuts.  One of the quirks of Budget day is that it will be for Jeremy Corbyn, not Mr McDonnell, to make that case, responding to Mr Osborne.  That is a tall order for any opposition leader. For Jeremy Corbyn, who enjoys huge support from the party's membership but not much from those sitting on the benches behind him, it is a huge ask.  But the opposition that really troubles Mr Osborne right now is those on his own benches. He'll be more interested in how they, and the public, respond - and if he's not the "lucky chancellor" any more, what they'll be calling him by the end of today.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35818169	Government defeated in Lords over immigration detention time limit	Ministers have been defeated in the Lords over limits on detention in immigration removal centres (IRC).  During the Immigration Bill debate, peers voted by 187 to 170 that detention must be limited to 28 days, except when a court decides otherwise.  The government had argued most of those detained either were foreign criminals, or had broken immigration rules before.  Opponents insisted the limit was needed because detaining people indefinitely had a negative impact on mental health.  It is the second time the government has been defeated over the bill. Lords voted a week ago to allow asylum seekers the right to work if their claims have not been processed within six months.  The 28-day cap was recently recommended by a cross-party group of MPs and peers.  Crossbench peer Lord Ramsbotham, a former HM inspector of prisons, put it forward as an amendment to the bill, saying he had done so because the current system "is not working".  He was backed by Labour and Lib Dem peers.  Recent inspections have found detainees being held for more than a year, and in two cases for as long as five years, at Verne IRC in Dorset and Harmondsworth IRC in west London - which is Europe's largest.  Meanwhile an inspection of Yarl's Wood IRC in Bedfordshire found almost 100 pregnant women among those been detained.  The report prompted Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick to say there should be "strict time limits" and vulnerable people should only be detained "in the most exceptional circumstances".  However, peers who supported the government in the debate warned that bringing in the 28-day cap could undermine the government's enforcement of immigration controls and make it more difficult to maintain public safety.  Lord Keen said the limit would give illegal migrants attempting to avoid being deported an "easy target" to aim for.  The change could lead to up to 10,000 people a year could appeal for release from detention, crossbench peer Lord Green of Deddington said.  Concerns were raised by several peers who opposed the amendment that it could lead to a deterioration of race relations - with released detainees potentially facing discrimination from land lords, and a return to the "bad old days of poor police race relations".  Lord Brown of Eaton-Under-Heywood, a crossbench peer, suggested a time limit of nine months would be better, pointing out that Sweden has a 12-month cut-off point.  But Labour peer Lord Rosser said the change would let the courts decide the issue.  Meanwhile, Lib Dem Lord Roberts of Llandudno said detainees should be treated with more compassion, because they are "not criminals, they are people... with lives and dreams".  Labour's Baroness Lister of Burtersett said indefinite detention impacted on people's mental health and the current situation was a "stain on this country's human rights record."	politics

The US authorities say Ryan Collins has agreed to plead guilty to the offence.  Prosecutors have recommended that he face a jail term of 18 months, although a judge could extend that to five years.  The 36-year-old is alleged to have stolen usernames and passwords via a phishing scam.  The Department of Justice said that the Pennsylvania-based Collins had admitted to breaking into more than 100 accounts between November 2012 and September 2014.  He is said to have achieved this by sending emails to the victims that pretended to be from Google or Apple requesting their login details.  "[The] defendant used numerous fraudulent email addresses designed to look like legitimate security accounts from various internet service providers, including, for example, email.protection318@icloud.com, noreply_helpdesk0118@outlook.com and secure.helpdesk0119@gmail.com," said court filings.  Once Collins fooled the account owners into handing over their details, prosecutors say, he searched through their online data.  "Through his phishing scheme [the] defendant was also able to access full Apple iCloud back-ups belonging to numerous victims, including at least 18 celebrities, many of whom reside in the Los Angeles area," the court papers state.  "Many of these back-ups contained nude photographs and videos."  The celebrities are not named, but the attacks coincide with stolen photos of the actresses Jennifer Lawrence, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and others being posted to the internet, which was blamed on an iCloud breach at the time.  Collins has not been accused of uploading the images for others to see.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35813656	Google calls on US to shake-up self-driving car laws	Google's self-driving car chief has urged lawmakers to ensure the US sets consistent laws for the technology.  Chris Urmson told a Senate hearing that the US Transport Secretary should be given authority over the matter rather than leaving it to individual states.  He also reiterated his company's view that it would safer if passengers were not able to override a vehicle's autonomous systems.  That contrasts with the view of California's regulator.  The state's Department of Motor Vehicles published draft rules in December that said a trained human must still be able to take control.  Mr Urmson noted that 23 states had now set a total of 53 pieces of legislation relating to self-driving vehicles, some of which are at odds with each other.  "We currently face a growing patchwork of state laws and regulations on self-driving cars that has the potential to become unworkable," Mr Urmson said.  "If every state is left to go its own way, it would be extremely impractical to operate an autonomous vehicle across state boundaries."  His view was supported at the Senate Commerce Committee by the pick-up service Lyft, which has partnered with General Motors to develop their own driverless cars.  "The worst possible scenario for the growth of autonomous vehicles is an inconsistent and conflicting patchwork of local, municipal and county laws that will hamper efforts to bring autonomous vehicle technology to market," said Joseph Okpaku, Lyft's director of public policy.  "Regulations are necessary, but regulatory restraint and consistency is equally as important if we are going to allow this industry to reach its full potential."  The risks posed by self-driving cars in their existing state were highlighted last month when one of Google's cars caused a collision with a bus in Santa Clara, California.  One robotics expert at the hearing urged the senators to resist pressure to permit the public to use self-driving cars too soon, and said the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) should take greater leadership over tests in the meantime.  Prof Missy Cummings from Duke University added that she thought that the "self-driving car community" had been "deficient" in the way it had carried out its experiments to date.  "I perceive [there] to be a rush to field systems that are not ready for widespread deployment," she explained.  "[One issue] is operation in bad weather, including standing water on roadways, drizzling rain, sudden downpours and snow.  "Coupling these limitations with the inability of self-driving cars to follow a traffic policeman's gestures - especially on a rainy day in a poncho - means self-driving cars should not really be operating near elementary schools at this time.  "Another major problem with self-driving cars is their vulnerability to malevolent or even prankster intent. For example, it is relatively easy to spoof the GPS of self-driving vehicles, which involves hacking into their systems and driving them off course.  "Additionally, recent research has shown that a $60 [£42] laser device can trick self-driving cars into sensing objects that are not there."  Prof Cummings also took aim at Mr Urmson's statement that Google's self-driving cars had now travelled 1.4 million miles (2.25 million km) on the roads, noting that New York's taxi cab fleet went further in little over a day.  She suggested that 275 million miles must be driven fatality-free before self-driving cars could be said to be safer than human-controlled vehicles. In the meantime, Prof Cummings said companies needed to be more transparent about the tests they carried out.  One of the tech firms responded by highlighting that self-driving vehicles employed multiple sensors at the same time.  "Each of those technologies has strengths and weaknesses," explained Delphi's Glen Devos.  "In some cases vision or Lidar [a laser-based system] may be compromised by weather, but radar is very strong in weather.  "It's absolutely true that sensors have strengths and weaknesses, but by combining those sensors you end up with a much more capable package, certainly with greater perception capability than an individual [human] driver relying on vision alone."  One of the senators raised the prospect that the US could fall behind other countries if it did not heed Google's warning and come up with a single set of rules.  "We were the first to introduce legislation permitting the testing of autonomous vehicles, but other countries are now clearly leapfrogging over us by offering more flexibility to companies to test this technology," said Senator Cory Booker.  "The UK, for example, is rapidly moving forward... and Japan has allowed Nissan and Toyota to test their vehicles there since 2013.  He added: "If the [current regulatory regimes] were around at the time of the Wright brothers, we would have never got off the ground in exploring air travel."  The Chancellor of the exchequer George Osborne is expected to confirm on Wednesday an expansion of the UK's self-driving tests by allowing computer-controlled lorries to share a stretch of motorway with the public later this year.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35810628	Investigatory Powers Bill: May defends surveillance powers	Home Secretary Theresa May has defended controversial new surveillance powers as MPs debated them for the first time.  The Investigatory Powers Bill will force the storage of internet browsing records for 12 months and authorise the bulk collection of personal data.  Mrs May said the measures were needed to keep the public safe and would uphold "both privacy and security".  Labour and the SNP said they backed the bill in principle but would withdraw support without substantial changes.  Labour's stance was branded "gutless" by the Lib Dems, who oppose the legislation.  The bill's second reading - where it was backed by 281 votes to 15 - gave MPs their first chance to debate it in the House of Commons. It represented an early step in a long parliamentary process which will see the details of the measures scrutinised at greater length over the coming months.  Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham said Labour would work constructively with Mrs May to get the legislation through Parliament but that "substantial changes" were needed to ensure the right balance "between collective security and individual privacy in the digital age".  Labour abstained at second reading and will be seeking amendments including a specific "presumption of privacy".  "We need new legislation but this bill is not yet good enough," he said. "Simply to block this legislation would, in my view, be irresponsible. It would leave the police and security services in limbo... We must give them the tools to do the job."  The proposals have already been significantly amended after a draft bill last year was heavily criticised by three parliamentary committees.  The government may be forced to give further ground if it is to get the law on to the statute book by the end of the year as it wants, although it is not expected to meet significant resistance until the bill reaches report stage and then goes to the House of Lords.  Mr Burnham called for the use of surveillance powers to be limited to more serious investigations and for greater clarity on who can use them.  He said he did not see why agencies such as the Gambling Commission or the Food Standards Agency should have access to people's internet records, and said he would be calling on Mrs May to "severely reduce" the list of agencies who would get the new powers.  He also called for an independent review of "bulk powers" - the sweeping up of vast quantities of internet data and the collection of personal information from databases by the security services.  "I want a bill that helps the authorities do their job but protects ordinary people from intrusion and abuse from those in positions of power," he added.  Mrs May has said Britain's spies must continue to be allowed to hack into foreign computer networks, under so-called "bulk equipment interference warrants", as this was "a key operational requirement for GCHQ".  She told MPs that bulk powers had played a significant role in every major counter-terrorism investigation over the past decade, including seven terror plots foiled in the past 18 months, and in responding to the bulk of cyber attacks against UK interests.  Operational requests for such information, she said, would have to be approved by a judge as well as the minister responsible under a regime of "robust and consistent safeguards".  But Conservative MP Owen Paterson, a former Northern Ireland secretary, said elected politicians accountable to Parliament and the public should be exclusively responsible for granting warrants.  The SNP said they were in favour of "targeted surveillance" but many of the powers being sought were of "dubious legality".  "We will work with others to try and amend the bill extensively," Joanna Cherry, the party's home affairs spokeswoman, said. "If the bill is not amended to our satisfaction, we reserve the right to vote it down at a later stage."  The Lib Dems blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to legislate in this area, which was dubbed "the snoopers' charter", when they were part of the coalition government.  Speaking in the debate, former leader Nick Clegg said the bill was an improvement on previous proposals but was "not in a fit state" - telling MPs that it was still predicated on a "dragnet approach" to data retention and the powers it sought to grant were "formidable and capable of misuse".  "The implications of this are very big indeed," he said.  "It is that the government believes as a matter of principle that every innocent act of communication online must leave a trace for future possible interrogation by the state. No other country in the world feels the need to do this apart from Russia."  UKIP MEP Steven Woolfe told the BBC's Daily Politics he was "deeply concerned" by the Investigatory Powers Bill, saying it "could put us into an extreme position of monitoring our citizens".  Edward Snowden, the former CIA analyst turned surveillance whistleblower, said he was closely following Tuesday's debate. He tweeted: "Britons, note how your MPs vote today on IPBill. A vote in favour, or abstention, is a vote against you. "  And Amnesty International warned that "wide-ranging snooping powers" were being rushed through parliament at "break-neck speed".	politics

Bez, a former Celebrity Big Brother winner who found chart fame as a maraca-shaking dancer in the 1990s, was in trouble with the Electoral Commission before he had even officially launched his party in January last year.  He was forced to change its name after the watchdog ruled it sounded too similar to another group, The Realists' Party.  The rechristened We Are The Reality Party, which campaigned against fracking and austerity, is now under fire for failing to submit a campaign expenditure report and other paperwork required by law, including quarterly donations and loans reports.  In a statement, the Electoral Commission acknowledged Bez's party was "relatively small and does not have substantial resources".  But it added: "Despite the Commission's ongoing efforts to engage with the party it continues to fail to meet its statutory requirements. The level of the fine reflects this."  In a separate move, the treasurer of No2EU Yes to Democracy, Mary Bryce, has been fined £3,750 for non-compliance.  The now defunct party was set up by Bob Crow's RMT union, with backing from the Communist Party of Britain among others, to fight the 2009 European elections on an anti-EU, pro-workers rights platform.  It de-registered in 2010 when activists drifted away but was brought back for the 2014 European elections, when it fielded 46 candidates, including Mr Crow, who died of a heart attack two months before polling day.  The party was wound up again in October 2014 - but its treasurer failed to deliver a spending report for the 2014 election, despite appearing to "spend a substantial sum" and delivered donations and loans reports late, the Electoral Commission said.  The commission said it had chosen to fine the treasurer rather than the party because of the lack of co-operation specifically by the treasurer.  An initial fine of £3,000 has been increased to £3,750 and will go up to £4,500 if the fine is not paid by 31 March, it added.  Louise Edwards, Head of Regulatory Compliance and Casework at the Electoral Commission, said: "Transparency around party spending does not become less important because a party ceases to be registered.  "It remains the treasurer's legal responsibility to ensure all required reports have been delivered to the Commission.  "Despite our efforts, NO2EU's spending almost two years ago at the European Parliament Elections still remains unknown as a result of this lack of co-operation."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35805131	Road offence 'reduction' may be due to police cuts	A sharp fall in the number of recorded motoring offences may be due to falling traffic officer numbers rather than an improvement in driving standards, MPs say.  The Transport Select Committee warned that police cuts would stop some offences being detected.  The number of specialist road policing officers in England and Wales fell from 7,104 to 4,356 between 2005 and 2014.  But the Home Office said the police had the resources they needed.  As the number of specialist road policing officers has fallen, there has been increasing use of technology to enforce traffic laws, the report said.  "For enforcement to be successful and for educational campaigns to be convincing there must be the likelihood that offenders will be apprehended.  "There is a growing concern that the lack of specialist dedicated road traffic officers means that 'minor' offences such as careless driving cannot be effectively detected and enforcement action taken."  The total number of offences detected on roads in England and Wales went from 4.3 million in 2004 to 1.5 million in 2014, the report said.  However, the number of offences resulting in a fatality - which will always be recorded - did not fall.  "This is significant as this suggests that the reduction in overall offences that are recorded does not represent a reduction in offences actually being committed," the report said.  Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the committee, said: "The fall in overall road offences does not reflect an improvement in driving."  The report said the government was right to focus on the "fatal four" - the main causes of road deaths - drink-driving, speeding, mobile phones and not wearing a seat belt.  It urged the Department for Transport to ensure detection rates for these offences were high, "whether through specialised road traffic police officers or by detection technology".  It recommended research into whether educational courses for poor driving had the required deterrent effect.  "By use of specialist officers, and appropriate use of technology, enforcement can be used alongside education which can make road users aware that serious driving offences will be detected," it added.  RAC spokesman Pete Williams said: "The sharp decline in roads policing officers appears to be having the very unwelcome effect of leading to fewer people being caught for illegal activity."  But the Home Office said: "Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has been clear that there is no link between police resources and crime levels and effective roads policing is dependent on a range of factors, from better driver awareness to increased use of fixed penalty notices."  It said the enforcement of traffic offences was an operational matter for the police.	politics

Currently gamers can only play together online if they use the same system.  One of the first games to support cross-platform play will be Rocket League, which Xbox and PC gamers will be able to play together via Xbox Live.  There is "an open invitation" for other networks to collaborate, the tech giant said.  The announcement was made as the developers conference ID@Xbox takes place this week.  The collective represents 1,400 independent studios creating games for Xbox One and Windows 10 devices.  Director Chris Charla said that it was "up to developers" to support the feature, in a letter posted online.  "Xbox Live players will always have the option of choosing to play only with other Xbox Live players," he added.  Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft all operate their own online networks for multiplayer games, with Sony and Microsoft charging gamers a monthly fee.  "Cross-network play has been the number one most requested feature our community has asked for since Rocket League was first announced on Xbox One," said Psyonix, the studio behind Rocket League.	tech

A spokeswoman said: "Vicki Kirby has been suspended from the Labour Party pending an investigation."  Ms Kirby was first suspended in 2014 for making anti-Semitic comments but later reinstated.  She was forced to stand down as an election candidate after tweets including one suggesting Hitler was a "Zionist God".  It emerged on Monday that since being reinstated Ms Kirby - whose Twitter account has been protected - is now vice-chair of the Labour constituency party in Woking, a development first reported by the Guido Fawkes website. It prompted an angry response from a number of Labour MPs on Twitter.  Following the fresh suspension, Labour MP Wes Streeting said it was "about time" Labour's ruling National Executive Committee had taken action.  He added: "I'm only sorry it has taken the intervention of scores of Labour MPs, party members ripping up membership cards and a police complaint to prompt it."  The BBC's political correspondent Ross Hawkins said that, although they would not confirm it, Labour's hand may have been forced by a complaint to Surrey Police by Kevin McKeever, who is a Labour candidate to be police and crime commissioner in Northamptonshire.  Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham told the BBC's Daily Politics: "From what I have seen, the comments are completely abhorrent."  Ex-minister Angela Smith told BBC Radio 4's The World at One there was "accumulating evidence" that there was a problem in the party and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn "could do more" to emphasise that there was "no place" for anti-Semitism and to "stamp it out".  She rejected suggestions that the issue was being used by critics of Mr Corbyn to undermine his leadership.  Ms Kirby's latest suspension comes in the wake of the recent expulsion of a far-left activist, Gerry Downing, following criticism of his views about 9/11 and so-called Islamic State.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35811777	Chinese hackers turn to ransomware	Chinese hackers are launching sophisticated ransomware attacks - in which they hijack machines and demand payment to decrypt them, according to reports.  Four separate security firms have spotted attacks they believe emanated from China in recent months, reveals Reuters.  There is speculation that the "skilled operators" could be state-sponsored hackers.  The Chinese government said it would investigate if there was reliable proof.  Dell SecureWorks investigated two ransomware attacks this year - one at a transportation company and one at a technology firm  In the second case, 30% of the unnamed firm's machines were captured by the hackers.  Phil Burdette, who heads an incident response team at Dell said: "It is obviously a group of skilled operators that have some amount of experience conducting intrusions."  Security firms Attack Research, InGuardians and G-C Partners said they had investigated three other similar attacks since December.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters that it would not act on "rumours and speculation" but the ministry itself said that if there was reliable proof, it would treat the matter seriously.  The Chinese government pledged to oppose economic espionage in an agreement with the US last year, with some US firms since reporting a drop in the amount of hacking sourced from China.  It also wants deeper internet security co-operation with the US as hacking continues to be a sore spot in US-China relations.  If the government has reduced its support for economic espionage, that may mean hackers are looking for other means of supplementing their incomes, reports Reuters.  Recently security firms warned about a huge surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware, which was blamed on new malware hitting the market which can avoid being spotted by anti-virus software.  Ransomware has been around for years but better encryption techniques mean it is often impossible for victims to regain access to their files without co-operation from the hackers.  Many ransomware payments are made in the virtual currency Bitcoin, and few firms are open about such attacks.	tech

The original case followed a complaint by its Russian rival Yandex.  Google had denied forcing device-makers to install its YouTube, Maps and Photos software alongside Android.  It now faces having to reword its contracts with manufacturers and paying a fine based on its local earnings.  However, it can still lodge a further appeal against the Moscow arbitration court's ruling.  "We're not commenting as we have not yet received the judgement," said a spokeswoman for the US company.  Yandex had alleged that it had been disadvantaged by Google's requirement that manufactures pre-load several apps if they wanted to be able to offer access to the Google Play store and other key elements of the Android operating system.  "We are satisfied with the court's decision to uphold the FAS (Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia) judgement in the case against Google," the Moscow-based firm said in a statement.  Google is also facing a related probe by the EU's competition commissioner into the bundling of apps and services with Android.  The antitrust authority's chief, Margrethe Vestager, announced in April 2015 that she had received two complaints about the way Google had allegedly tied several of its services together.  Last week, the news agency Bloomberg reported that EU investigators appeared to be readying a statement of objections - a document that would confirm that they believed the firm was at fault, which must be filed before a formal ruling.  A spokesman for the European Commission told the BBC that he was unable to comment about what its next step would be or its timing.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35810133	Google's AI wins final Go challenge	Google's AlphaGo artificial intelligence has secured its fourth win over a master player, in the final of a five match challenge.  Lee Se-dol, one of the world's top Go players, won just one of the matches against Google's AI, missing out on the $1m prize up for grabs.  In Go, players take turn placing stones on a 19-by-19 grid, competing to take control of the most territory.  The game is considered to be much more challenging for computers than chess.  The five match challenge began in Seoul on 9 March, where AlphaGo scored its first victory.  After losing the second match, Lee Se-dol said he was "speechless" adding that the AlphaGo machine played a "nearly perfect game".  In the third game commentators said that Lee Se-dol had brought his "top game" but that AlphaGo had won "in great style".  Google's winning streak means it will pocket the $1m (£702,000) prize on offer.  But Lee Se-dol did win the fourth game, after which he said: "I've never been congratulated so much because I've won one game."  The AlphaGo system was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.  It has built up its expertise by studying older games and teasing out patterns of play.  To beat one of the world's top players, Deep Mind used a mixture of clever strategies to make the search much smaller.  Does this mean AI is now smarter than us and will kill us mere humans? Certainly not.  AlphaGo doesn't care if it wins or loses. It doesn't even care if it plays and it certainly couldn't make you a cup of tea after the game.  Does it mean that AI will soon take your job? Possibly you should be more worried about that.  Go is thought to date back to several thousand years ago in China.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35709755	A survival guide for families split over EU referendum	"We are a split house on EU, but - wondrously - no fights, respect the other's view. Let's hope the journos/Westminster do same."  So tweeted novelist Sandra Howard, when husband Michael, the former Conservative leader, signed up to the Leave campaign.  But will everybody find it as easy to preserve domestic harmony in the run up to the EU referendum on 23 June?  Referendums are strange things. Unlike party politics, where you tend to know where your other half stands, they can throw up surprising opinions and previously buried viewpoints.  How did you live with someone for this long without knowing they were a raving Europhile/Eurosceptic?  The 2014 Scottish independence referendum was famous for causing family rifts. Stuart Valentine, chief executive of counselling service Relationship Scotland, says some of these wounds have yet to heal.  He does not expect the EU referendum to stir the same passions but, he adds, many of the couples he sees have problems with each other's "world view", particularly if it has changed over time.  It normally surfaces in disagreements over how to bring up the children, says Mr Valentine, but political opinions can be thrown in to the mix too.  "Not belittling someone for holding a different view is really important," he says. "Try to show respect and be civil to each other."  That may be easier said than done, perhaps. Particularly if you have a killer fact that you know will settle the argument once and for all.  But none of this applies to the 20% or more of the population who have yet to make up their mind, including, it turns out, one-time TV power couple Richard and Judy.  "On the whole, Richard leans towards the outies, while I drift towards the innies," wrote Judy Finnigan, in the couple's Daily Express column.  "I don't like the EU but the innate caution that so often goes with motherhood is making me worry about the consequences of leaving in terms of the economy and defence. Richard is braver and more robust than me."  The idea that men are braver, more decisive characters will not ring true in many households.  But the referendum campaign has been a curiously masculine affair so far, according to Deborah Mattinson, of pollsters Britain Thinks, and it is making women angry.  "We know that women are undecided about the EU referendum," she writes.  "They're less likely than men to express certainty on a whole range of issues.  "Crucially though, they're no less likely to vote - in fact there are more women voters than men. So there are millions of women's votes potentially up for grabs in the referendum.  "It's remarkable that the two campaigns aren't making more effort to go after them."  Both sides need to become more "human" and stop bellowing at each other about statistics, advises the former New Labour guru.  It's not just couples that find themselves on different sides of the great referendum debate. The fault lines can run through families too.  Just look at the Johnson clan. Boris is an outer. His wife Marina may also be, judging by this article setting out her doubts about the wisdom of remaining in.  But father Stanley, a former member of the European Parliament, and brothers Jo, a Conservative science minister, and Leo, a sustainability expert, are inners. Boris Johnson's mother Charlotte, a painter, was an inner but has been converted to an outer.  We know all this because the London Mayor's sister, Rachel Johnson (an inner), gave us an account of her brother's anguish as he inched towards declaring his position, in a piece for the Daily Mail.  It has not split the family, she stresses. Despite what everyone assumes.  Arabella Russell, a counsellor with Relate, advises couples not to shy away from airing their political differences.  "Some people feel quite fearful that their partner might have different views to them," she says, "They think 'these are my values and beliefs and I think my partner should share them'."  In her work with couples, Ms Russell advises them that they do not have to be the same person. She thinks debates about political issues like the EU can be an "opportunity for growth," provided you keep it civil, of course.  "Try to talk very honestly and openly about why you find someone else's opinions difficult," she says.  We'll leave the final word to Sandra Howard, who takes to the ping pong table when husband Michael refuses to budge on the EU issue.  "Trouble is he always wins - at table tennis..."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35808186	Budget 2016: No more 'easy choices' for Osborne	Year after year, Budget after Budget, George Osborne has stood at the despatch box and promised to balance the books.  Indeed, closing the gap between what the government spends and what it takes in taxes was the government's main mission.  But it has proved harder than Mr Osborne had hoped. He would blame circumstances beyond his control which - again - threaten to push his targets further back.  His critics on one side would say the initial pace of the cuts are what dragged the recovery down - a self-defeating object.  Critics on the right would say in fact he's lacked the courage to go far enough.  In the febrile atmosphere less than 48 hours before a Budget, there is agreement on one thing - whether fast or slow, the most straightforward cuts, practically and politically, have gone.  Former head of the Home Civil Service Lord Kerslake, who was until recently one of the most senior officials involved in the hunt for savings, says clearly: "It's hard to see where the easy choices are now."  He told me: "The savings that have to be found will require very substantial changes in the way things are delivered - or, indeed, the offer made."  In other words, public services will have to be delivered much more cheaply, or the public will have to accept very different levels of provision.  And with Mr Osborne significantly behind on his own original targets from 2010, by accident or design, Lord Kerslake told me: "We've still got some way to go, no more than half on the numbers.  "The important thing to say is that the second half is much harder because the sense of crisis that drove the savings in the coalition government has ebbed, the wider economy is growing so people can't see a comparable position there and people just get exhausted by the process.  "The easy savings have been done. So where do you go?"  Well, the chancellor is likely to announce further squeezes on welfare spending - the government has already outlined taking another billion out of the budget allocated to disabled people.  There are likely, by 2020, to be cuts of an extra £4bn a year by 2020. To raise revenue, there could possibly be a rise in fuel tax - politically difficult but lucrative for the government coffers - maybe hikes in insurance premiums, and what one Tory MP described as "nibbles here and there".  With the European referendum bearing down on Numbers 10 and 11 there is a desire not to stir up too much controversy, not to distract too much from their main task in hand.  But as Lord Kerslake warns, taking anything else out of government budgets that have already been slimmed down is tricky - a task almost bound to cause complaint in itself.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35801477	Fans protest after Twitch account switch	Gaming fans have reacted with anger after divorce led to a popular Twitch gaming channel changing hands.  Ara_Gaming had been on hiatus for months while its owner, known to followers as Sarah, resolved personal issues including divorcing her husband.  Sarah is believed to have offered ownership of the channel, and its related social media accounts, to her husband in the divorce settlement.  Some of the channel's 30,000 fans sent him insults and even death threats.  The row blew up on Sunday as the Ara_Gaming channel returned - but with a new host called Crystal. Followers bombarded the host with questions on the chat channel about what had happened to Sarah.  The volume of comments led Sarah's former husband to clarify what had happened, saying that the company that handled Ara_Gaming and its associated social media account had been "offered" to him in the divorce.  He said he had been "reluctant" to take on the channel and its followers because he was not a gamer and had little experience of curating a popular social media identity. The company behind Ara_Gaming is now owned by Crystal, the new host, who is related to Sarah's husband.  He also took to Twitter to explain the situation and asked people to be civil with their enquiries.  "Ara_Gaming will not be 'given back' b/c it was not taken. It was offered. So if the death threats could please stop that would be great," wrote the new owner.  Fans reacted poorly to the news on Twitter with many using the #aragate hashtag to publicise what had happened. Many advised those who had followed Ara_Gaming to cancel their subscription, stop donating and to unfollow the channel.  Comments supporting Sarah and asking her to start up a new channel were posted by fans on Ara_Gaming's YouTube, Twitter and Steam pages.  Sarah has registered a new Twitter account under the name @thesneezle.  Meanwhile, a Twitter user called IronCore45 who used to help Sarah moderate the Ara_Gaming channel, posted a message thanking fans for their support.  He added: "I truly hope none of you have to experience such a thing as having your private life exposed to the internet for hateful speculation."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35804750	Lib Dem plan for 'all-disabled' election shortlists	The Liberal Democrats are to offer local associations the chance to use "all-disabled shortlists" to select candidates to stand in elections.  The party adopted a motion - which also allows for all-women shortlists - at its spring conference at the weekend.  The voluntary measure aims to boost diversity amongst candidates and MPs.  Lib Dem president Baroness Brinton told the BBC it was "ridiculous" that there were "only a handful" of disabled people in Parliament.  She told BBC Radio 5 Live the Lib Dems were offering "a full range of support" for candidates for under-represented groups.  Rejecting the charge that it was tokenistic, she said: "We've tried support and mentoring for candidates from these under-represented groups and it's just not working."  Part of the problem, she said, was that people - whether members or the electorate - often "can't see beyond the wheelchair or the British Sign Language interpreter".  "Their view of an MP is not somebody in a wheelchair and that is really, really frustrating," she added.  It was vital therefore to persuade the public that disabled parliamentarians "have done a very good job", she said.  The party will try the format in the run up to the 2020 general election - and would try to encourage take-up by proposing spaces on the shortlists of "winnable seats".  "We're going to get the best of our candidates together and where a seat is happy to support it we're going to actually have a contest that makes sure we have a brilliant disabled candidate ready to go for a winnable seat in Parliament," she said.  In addition, Lady Brinton explained, the party will be asking local parties in the "top seats" to declare who they have approached - for example women, disabled people, black and ethnic minority and LGBT candidates - before starting the selection process.  "We think that's going to be a real culture change, from the grassroots up," Baroness Brinton said.  At the 2015 general election the Lib Dems were reduced from 57 to eight MPs, all of whom are white males, aged between 45 and 67.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34484687	The battle to be the official EU referendum Leave campaign	A referendum will be held on 23 June on whether the UK will remain a member of the European Union or not. Here's a guide to the two groups currently battling to become the official Leave campaign.  The two main campaigns are Vote Leave and Leave.EU/Grassroots Out.  This group was launched on 9 October 2015, and comprises a cross-party group of MPs and peers from the Conservatives, Labour, UKIP and other parties.  It is funded by people of different party affiliations including City millionaire and Tory donor Peter Cruddas, Labour's biggest private financial backer John Mills and Stuart Wheeler, a Tory-turned-UKIP donor.  Vote Leave is being run by Taxpayers' Alliance campaign group founder Matthew Elliot, who organised the successful 'No2AV' campaign in the referendum on reform of the Westminster voting system, and Dominic Cummings, a former aide to Conservative cabinet minister Michael Gove.  The group is being backed by Mr Gove, who is co-chairing its campaign committee, as well as four other members of David Cameron's Cabinet who are backing EU exit, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers, Chris Grayling and John Whittingdale.  Mayor of London Boris Johnson is another key figure. The group hopes he can win over undecided Conservatives and reach others - including younger voters - with his particular brand of campaigning.  Douglas Carswell, UKIP's only MP, has broken ranks with his party leader to support the group as has the party's former deputy chair Suzanne Evans. Also on board is Nigel Dodds, the Westminster leader of the Democratic Unionists Party.  Leave.EU was initially called The Know and rebranded when an amended referendum question was proposed. Founded by UKIP donor Arron Banks, it was backed by leader Nigel Farage, who billed it as an "umbrella group" of anti-EU campaigners.  Mr Farage and Leave.EU have since become part of the Grassroots Out Movement after its launch in January. The cross-party group is also being backed by Labour MP Kate Hoey as well as ex-Conservative ministers Liam Fox and David Davis, among other politicians.  Also backing GO is former Respect MP George Galloway and DUP MP Sammy Wilson.  It is holding a series of events across the country to try and mobilise support, setting up stalls in 500 locations on a single day. It says its goal is to bring together existing leave campaigns and get them to work as one in local areas.  Leave.EU and Grassroots Out have effectively merged for the purpose of trying to secure the official lead campaign status for the Out side.  It will be up to the elections watchdog, the Electoral Commission, to designate which of the groups will become the official Leave campaign. The process has begun, with a decision due by the middle of April.  The Electoral Commission will judge each applicant's merits on the basis of a range of criteria, such as level of cross-party support, campaign tactics and organisational capacity.  The chosen group (as well as the official In campaign) will benefit from increased spending limits of £7m during the campaign period, campaign broadcasts and a free mail-out to households. They all get access to public meeting rooms and to the electoral register, and are entitled to public grants of up to £600,000.  Six months ago, there was talk that the two groups would inevitably end up co-operating with each other and potentially even merging.  But relations between the two sides soured amid arguments over their strategies. Efforts at bridge-building have come to nothing.  Mr Farage has said Vote Leave is making "Westminster-based" business arguments and that only Leave.EU/Grassroots Out will be able to reach outside to wider audiences. Leave.EU has said its rival was "run by the Westminster bubble".  But Mr Carswell has suggested it was a "one-horse race" in favour of Vote Leave to become the official campaign, and dismissed the level of support for Leave.EU, saying: "Getting a whole bunch of likes on Facebook is not the same as winning a referendum."  Unlike the In campaign, which is clearly being led by David Cameron, the Out campaign has not settled on a single figurehead.  This may not happen, with the possibility of key figures such as Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and Conservative employment minister Priti Patel being deployed in rotation to make different arguments and appeal to separate groups.  Much will depend on which campaign group wins the official designation and whether there is a head-to-head TV debate during the campaign. This is not guaranteed and both Boris Johnson and Michael Gove have apparently ruled out taking on the prime minister face-to-face.  Nigel Farage's role is likely to attract much attention. He has insisted he does not want to lead the official campaign, with some Eurosceptics thinking he would be too divisive a figure to fill that role. He has however said UKIP will "take the lead" in the Out campaign.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave.

A ban could affect content on services such as YouTube and ITV Hub.  In 2007, the broadcasting regulator Ofcom introduced strict rules banning the advertising of food high in fat, sugar and salt (HFSS) during television programmes likely to appeal to under-16s.  Those rules are enforced by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), which also regulates "non-broadcast" ads such as print, billboards and online streaming.  Many companies now use online video to promote products to young audiences.  The ASA's chief executive Guy Parker told an audience at the Westminster Food and Nutrition Forum that he was often asked why junk food ads were banned on television but allowed during the same programmes when streamed online.  The BBC understands the CAP will launch a public consultation on the subject before the summer.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35801294	Budget 2016: George Osborne's political balancing act	Like Sherlock Holmes, we must look in this Budget for the dogs that do not bark. Four years out from a general election, this is the time in the political cycle when chancellors can take unpopular decisions. A moment, perhaps, for a big reform to our pensions or taxation. Yet the mood music emerging from the Treasury is distinctly adagio.  For George Osborne finds himself constrained by the EU referendum, a restive Tory party, a sluggish global economy and leadership ambitions that are not without challenge.  The chancellor does not wish to anger the electorate unduly with significant tax rises just a few months before asking them to vote on Britain's membership of the EU.  He does not wish to test the patience of fractious Conservative MPs, many of whom would be more than happy to turn the Budget-enacting Finance Bill into a cause celebre for the EU exit cause.  He does not wish to make bold decisions that might look risky as the global economy stutters. And he does not wish to take decisions that might endanger his hopes of succeeding David Cameron.  Thus the political and economic parameters of this Budget - which, as a result, will be more cautious than it might have been.  Genuinely radical plans to overhaul pension tax relief have been put on hold for fear of upsetting middle and higher earners. Proposals to cut the 45p top rate of tax are said to have gone the same way.  There has been no significant announcement trailed in the Sunday newspapers. And Mr Osborne's pre-Budget set-piece interview on Sunday with Andrew Marr was notable more for the chancellor's thinly disguised gibes at his rival Boris Johnson than anything he had to say about this week's financial statement.  And yet this Budget cannot and will not be entirely without substance. There are some things Mr Osborne cannot put off for another day. Above all, he has to act to ensure that he will meet his target of achieving a surplus by 2019/20. This is a commitment that now has force of law.  Under the latest figures, published in the autumn, the chancellor will narrowly meet his target by a mere £10bn. The independent Office for Budgetary Responsibility is expected to say that the British economy is smaller than the watchdog had expected it would be when it made that prediction. As such, the Treasury would get less than it had expected in tax revenues.  So that means Mr Osborne will have to consider either more spending cuts or tax rises. He told Andrew Marr he was planning a further £4bn of cuts, although some of these might be delayed until later in this Parliament. This will not be easy. He appears to have ruled out cutting pension tax relief. So he is looking at squeezing some disability benefits and taking a scythe to Whitehall once again.  The chancellor will also have to raise a few taxes. Increasing fuel duty would provoke squeals from Tory MPs. But if he cannot raise fuel duty when oil prices are as low as they are now then he will never do so. It is worth noting that the Tory manifesto in 2015 did not rule out raising fuel duty.  Mr Osborne could also raise insurance premium tax again, slyly making us all pay more to insure our cars and houses. He might see if he can cut some relief on employers' pension contributions. And he will raise a few million pounds by clamping down on people using so-called personal service companies to cut their income tax bills.  His task is to come up with enough tax increases to raise some decent cash without scaring his MPs so much that he faces possible defeat in the House of Commons where, we must never forget, the government has but a small majority.  For as well as making cuts to keep his deficit target on track, Mr Osborne also needs to act to keep his leadership hopes on track. He has been bruised by a string of recent set backs over tax credit cuts, Sunday trading rules and Google's modest tax bill.  Mr Osborne will want to use his Budget to restore some gloss to a reputation that has dulled in the eyes of many Tory MPs. So some tax cuts are expected, particularly to income tax thresholds and rates, to rally the Tory back benches. Those same MPs will also want to see Mr Osborne score some points against Jeremy Corbyn as the Labour leader makes his first response to a Budget, perhaps the hardest gig in British politics.  So these are constraints around which Mr Osborne has to operate this week. The biggest shadow is cast by the referendum campaign. If Britain votes to leave the EU, then this Budget will be instantly forgotten. But if Britain votes to stay, then the decisions announced this week could help shape not just the future of the economy but also who leads this country.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35778288	Minecraft to run artificial intelligence experiments	Minecraft is to become a testing ground for artificial intelligence experiments.  Microsoft, owner of the popular video game, revealed that computer scientists and amateurs will be able to evaluate and develop AI software using its virtual landscapes from July.  The company says Minecraft is more "sophisticated" than existing AI research simulations and cheaper to use than building a robot.  One expert said it had great potential.  "This is the state-of-the-art," said Prof Jose Hernandez-Orallo from the Technical University of Valencia, one of a small group of academics given early access to the software.  "At this moment there is nothing comparable, and this is just in its beginnings, so I see many possibilities for it."  To take advantage of the offer, users will need to install AIX - a software platform that hooks into Minecraft and allows the artificial intelligence code to control a character and get feedback about the consequences of its actions.  AIX will be open source, meaning the only cost involved will be that of buying a standard licence for the game.  The experiments will run on the researchers' own computers and be "roped off" from normal players. However, in time the aim is to allow people to interact with the code.  "People build amazing structures that do amazing things in Minecraft, and this allows experimenters to put in tasks that will stretch AI technology beyond its current capacity," explained Katja Hofmann, who leads the project at Microsoft Research's Cambridge lab in the UK.  "But eventually, we will be able to scale this up further to include tasks that allow AI agents to learn to collaborate with humans and support them in a creative manner.  "This provides a way to take AI from where it is today up to human-level intelligence, which is where we want to be, in several decades time."  Improving AI software by getting it to play video games has been done before. But Microsoft suggests the open-ended nature of Minecraft makes it particularly useful because of the huge variety of situations it can simulate from first-person perspectives.  "It allows you to have 'embodied AI'," explained Matthew Johnson, the principal software engineer working on AIX.  "So, rather than have a situation where the AI sees an avatar of itself, it can actually be inside, looking out through the eyes of something that is living in the world.  "We think this is an essential part of building this kind of general intelligence."  Microsoft expects one of the most popular types of research will be reinforcement learning, in which an AI agent learns how best to carry out a task via a mix of experimentation and use of prior knowledge, rather than being told what to do.  This process was recently used by Google's AlphaGo program. Last week, it triumphed against one of the best ever players of the board game Go after having played thousands of games against itself to discover new strategies.  While that was a specialised task, Microsoft suggests Minecraft provides a way for AI to learn a wide range of concepts.  "Experimenters could design a task with features such as lava, which might be very dangerous for the agent, and then evaluate how quickly it can learn to interpret the environment," Ms Hofmann told the BBC.  "But the platform is also open to more general AI research, for example how to make agents integrate language and vision.  "We see this as a stepping stone to technology that will eventually be applied to robotics, but that we can first explore in a safer environment that we completely control and is very cheap to run."  Although AI specialists may get the most out of the platform, Microsoft stresses that AIX will also support simple programs that children can create, and the firm has promised to provide a range of teaching materials.  "We want people of all skills and ages to get involved," said Mr Johnson.  "Kids could create agents in a world they are already fascinated with, and play with them," he said.  "This could boost young people's interest in artificial intelligence, and we expect that in the next 10 to 20 years we are going to need more people working in the area."	tech

Anthony Foxx told the BBC that accidents were inevitable, but that the emerging technology should not be compared "against perfection".  Nobody was hurt in the crash, but it was the first time Google's on-board computer has been blamed for causing a collision.  Secretary Foxx was attending the South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas.  He announced that seven US cities - Austin, Columbus, Denver, Kansas City, Pittsburgh, Portland and San Francisco - had reached the final stage of a competition to receive $40m in government funding for "smart" technologies.  Secretary Foxx agreed that smart technologies could put some people out of work.  "Driverless technology presents a lot of potential for disruption on a number of fronts," he said.  "It's unclear to me now exactly how that future unfolds."  Secretary Foxx is leading efforts to bring self-driving cars to US roads. The Obama administration has committed $4bn to that goal - which includes attempts to develop standardised regulations for autonomous card across the entire country.  On the public perception of self-driving cars following the February Google crash, he said: "It's not a surprise that at some point there would be a crash of any technology that's on the road.  "But I would challenge one to look at the number of crashes that occurred on the same day that were the result of human behaviour."  "I think the question here isn't comparing the automated car against perfection, I think it's a relative comparison to what we have now on the roads which is you and I, and our eyeballs, and our brains."  One challenge would be to tackle the legal issue of responsibility when crashes occur - and whether the passenger should be liable, or, given that the computer was driving, the companies behind the software that failed.  "That's precisely the type of question that we're hoping over the next several months to provide feedback to both the states and the industry on."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35796861	Budget 2016: George Osborne warns of cuts of 50p per £100	Chancellor George Osborne has warned the UK has to "act now rather than pay later" ahead of next week's Budget, with further spending cuts planned.  He said the cuts would be "equivalent to 50p in every £100" of public spending by 2020, which was "not a huge amount in the scheme of things".  He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the world was "more uncertain" than at any time since the financial crisis.  He said the UK needed to live within its means to withstand economic shocks.  Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment to enable the UK economy to "withstand the global headwinds".  Mr Osborne warned of cuts to come in his upcoming Budget on 16 March in a BBC interview last month.  Speaking on the Marr Show, Mr Osborne said the world was now "a more difficult and dangerous place" and warned about the state of the global economy.  While Britain was better placed to cope with economic shocks compared with 2008, it was "not immune to what's going on", he said.  "My message in this Budget is that the world is a more uncertain place than at any time since the financial crisis and we need to act now so we don't pay later," he said.  "That is why I need to find additional savings equivalent to 50p in every £100 the government spends by the end of the decade, because we've got to live within our means to stay secure.  "That's the way we make Britain fit for the future."  The chancellor - whose Budget on Wednesday will be his eighth - said he thought the savings were achievable, but he would not be drawn on where the axe would fall.  He said the government's plan had enabled it to invest in "the public's priorities", such as the NHS, science and education, infrastructure and defence, "while at the same time not spending more than the country can afford".  Mr Osborne added that he wanted to boost productivity, improve Britain's schools and infrastructure and make taxes "more competitive".  The chancellor declined to be drawn on whether fuel duty would be increased - something Tory backbenchers are urging him against.  But he added: "On fuel duty, we had a manifesto commitment there and we have pencilled in fuel duty plans going forward but what I would say is, every time we can have our economy more competitive, we do."  Mr Osborne also rejected claims that the most vulnerable people would be hit in the Budget through cuts to disability benefits known as Personal Independence Payments (PIP).  He said the government was "increasing spending on disabled people", but added that it was right to make sure the system was being "properly managed".  Also on Marr, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell called for more long-term investment in the UK economy, specifically in skills, infrastructure and new technology.  He said the chancellor had reduced investment to 1.4% of GDP which was "unacceptable", saying the OECD has said the figure should be at least 3%.  "What I want to do is to make sure we invest in the long term and then we can withstand the global headwinds," he added.  He said prosperity needed to be "shared by all", saying the government's economic policies had created an "unequal" society.  The chancellor has promised to get the books into surplus by 2020.  In his November Autumn Statement, he watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments. He was able to do this owing to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.  BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier said: "Only four months ago, when he made the Autumn Statement, Mr Osborne had sounded upbeat about the country's finances.  "But now, with the size of the British economy much smaller than had been expected, it seems the chancellor has not left himself much wriggle room."  In his Marr interview, Mr Osborne also warned against the UK leaving the EU, saying it "would create an economic shock" that would "cost jobs" and "damage living standards".  Leave campaigners say the UK could strike favourable trade deals with the EU after exit, arguing that Britain's future if better off outside.  Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell said he and the Labour shadow cabinet would be "on the stomp" campaigning for a remain vote amid criticism Labour has been quiet in the campaign.	politics

Tom Watson told Sky News those who had elected Jeremy Corbyn "on a very large mandate" last September would not want to see him challenged months later.  "I hope that those MPs on all sides of this argument will pay heed to that," he said.  Recent reports say some Labour MPs are now set on trying to oust Mr Corbyn.  Two days ago, BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said a minority of MPs seemed more determined than ever to mount a challenge soon.  Our correspondent said tension in the party is heightening ahead of elections in May in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities, with Mr Corbyn's allies and critics each staking out their positions.  Labour's deputy leader said: "This is the great irony of politics in that there are people in the party who are trying to change the rules in order to try and protect Jeremy's position and they might just be precipitating a challenge to his leadership.  "Of course that's just not common sense and I hope those people who are holding those different point of views can calm down a bit.  In other comments, Mr Watson said he was "incredibly disappointed... and I know Jeremy is too" by Ken Livingstone's recent remarks that a hedge fund manager donating to Labour MP Dan Jarvis was like "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group".  "That was very unhelpful because what we're trying to do is make sure that all our members and our MPs stick to talking about policies and issues and don't slug it out with personal insults," Mr Watson said.  Mr Jarvis, whom some commentators see as a future Labour leader, has not responded to Mr Livingstone publically.  The hedge fund donor, Martin Taylor, said the former London mayor's remarks were "inflammatory and unfounded".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35797102	Artificial intelligence: Go master Lee Se-dol wins against AlphaGo program	A master player of the game Go has won his first match against a Google computer program, after losing three in a row in a best-of-five competition.  Lee Se-dol, one of the world's top players, said his win against AlphaGo was "invaluable".  The Chinese board game is considered to be a much more complex challenge for a computer than chess, and AlphaGo's wins were seen as a landmark moment for artificial intelligence.  A fifth game will be played on Tuesday.  Go is a game of two players who take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  Commentator Michael Redmond said AlphaGo had been playing well up until the middle of the same, but at move 78, Mr Lee played brilliantly.  Speaking after his victory, Mr Lee said: "I've never been congratulated so much because I've won one game."  Google representatives said the defeat was "very valuable" for AlphaGo, as it identified a problem which they could now try to fix.  In the first game of the series, AlphaGo triumphed by a very narrow margin - Mr Lee had led for most of the match, but AlphaGo managed to build up a strong lead in its closing stages.  After losing the second match to Deep Mind, Lee Se-dol said he was "speechless" adding that the AlphaGo machine played a "nearly perfect game".  In the third game commentators said that Lee Se-dol had brought his "top game" but that AlphaGo had won "in great style".  The AlphaGo system was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.  It has built up its expertise by studying older games and teasing out patterns of play.  DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo "played itself, different versions of itself, millions and millions of times and each time got incrementally slightly better".  "It learns from its mistakes," he told the BBC.  Go is thought to date back to several thousand years ago in China.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35752657	SXSW 2016: Little impact from isolated online abuse summit	In funky downtown Austin, Texas, the South By Southwest Interactive festival attracts enthusiastic start-ups desperate to grab your attention. Over and over again you hear people implore: "Please sign up!"  But over the river, a very different tone can be found at a side-event that looks to take on an uncomfortable truth for the cheerful masses - that for an increasing number of people, being on the internet is a miserable, and sometimes dangerous experience.  For the first time in SXSW's 22-year history, the festival has facilitated an Online Harassment Summit. It was intended to be a gathering of people who have been affected, as well as a smattering of people who might be able to do something about the problem.  In the end, the event marked by determination but frustration - with little sign of tangible progress.  The path to Saturday's summit was dramatic. It began when Caroline Sinders, a Brooklyn-based user researcher, mooted the idea of a panel discussion at SXSW looking at online harassment - specifically, harassment within gaming.  After threats of harassment and made were made, Ms Sinders' panel was cancelled by SXSW.  So too was a separate panel organised by several supporters of Gamergate - a controversial online movement which at that time said it was about ethical concerns in gaming journalism, but was regarded by others as a thinly-veiled front for misogynistic abuse.  Neither panel had mentioned Gamergate specifically, but the issues at hand were undoubtedly linked.  The cancellation of Ms Sinders' event caused uproar, and threats from some media outlets to boycott the entire SXSW event.  It lead to a compromise: an entire day of discussion about online harassment, but at a venue that could be protected with tight security.  Attending the event was Brianna Wu, a games developer who has been on the receiving end of online abuse for well over a year.  Hosting a panel which asked "Is a safer, saner and civil internet possible?", Ms Wu accused social networks of standing by while their platforms were used to spread hate.  "When it comes to pragmatically moving the ball forward, we need oversight for social media companies," Ms Wu told the BBC later.  "They need outside people to come in and view their processes to make sure that things like death threats and harassment has no role in the public conversation.  "We need social media companies to step up their policies - because they are failing us."  Representatives from several technology companies - most notably Google and Facebook - also took part in panel sessions.  Google declined the BBC's request for an interviewed on the subject, but Facebook's head of product policy, Monika Bickert, said the site was doing all it could, but that technological solutions were in short supply.  "When we think about hate speech and harassment, it's so highly contextual," Ms Bickert told the BBC.  "You might for instance have someone using a racial slur to attack a person, and that would violate our policies. [But] you might also have somebody using that slur to say 'this morning, on the subway, someone called me this word, it was upsetting'.  "We need a real person looking at it to make a decision."  On the subject of inviting in some kind of independent auditors to monitor how effective Facebook's measures against harassment are, Ms Bickert said it worked closely with outside experts.  Facebook's view presents a rather disheartening stalemate - no amount of technology will prevent the real problem at hand: that human beings can be horrible to each other.  But Shireen Mitchell comes at the problem from a different angle. She founded a group called Digital Sisters. It advocates for efforts to diversify technology companies, loosening the dominance of white males at most big technology companies.  "The reason that many who are in the tech industry don't know what's happening, or can't identify it, is because they're coming from a different cultural spectrum.  "If you are inclusive of women, women from different backgrounds, transgender women, women of colour, you will be able to parse out what the challenges are and get to it sooner."  This suggestion hasn't fallen on deaf ears - many technology companies are actively looking at ways to build a more diverse workforce in a manner which is targeted, rather than tokenism.  But Ms Mitchell said she feels minorities are given a tougher ladder to climb in proving their worth.  "When it comes to people of colour, they're asked to have two degrees, three degrees… but people like Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates - they're drop-outs!"  Caroline Sinders, the person behind the original panel that lead to this entire day, told the BBC she was worried about how isolated the event was from the main hub of SXSW action.  "I worry at a place like [SXSW], because it was thrown together so hastily, it was more around talking about harassment and not about solving harassment," she said.  "As opposed to saying 'everyone come over here', I think a lot of these panels would have been better situated within SXSW.  "By creating a completely separate space for an online harassment panel, we are far away, we're missing all these other people that maybe had no idea."  But, she said, she was encouraged that the issue of online harassment was at least being clearly defined.  She likened the current situation to that of domestic violence awareness campaigns in the 1970s and 80s.  By giving online harassment a name, and helping both victims and perpetrators recognise when it is occurring, real work can at least begin.

More than 500,000 people are expected to face a cut in their Personal Independence Payments under the changes.  The government says the reforms will ensure those most in need receive help, and save more than a billion pounds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35793004	Disability benefit change to affect half a million	More than half a million disabled people could lose out as a result of further changes over the next four years to welfare payments.  The formula the government uses to calculate the daily living component of Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for disabled people will change in January.  The government said 640,000 people could be affected by this by 2020.  It said it would save £1.2bn and ensure PIP was fairer, but disability charities criticised the move.  Recipients of PIP are assessed using a points system to determine what level of help they receive.  Claimants can get between £21.80 and £139.75 per week.  An independent review found that the assessment criteria "may not be working as planned" and a subsequent review found a "significant number of people" were likely to be getting the benefit despite having minimal-to-no ongoing daily living extra costs, the Department for Work and Pensions said.  It said many of the aids and appliances for which points were awarded were likely already to be found in people's homes.  So the weight given to the use of aids and appliances in two of the 10 daily living activities - dressing and managing toilet needs - will be reduced from January.  The minister for disabled people, Justin Tomlinson, said: "Many people are eligible for a weekly award despite having minimal to no extra costs and judicial decisions have expanded the criteria for aids and appliances to include items we would expect people to have in their homes already.  "This new change will ensure that PIP is fairer and targets support at those who need it most."  The Department for Work and Pensions said that over the last six months there had been three legal judgements that had ruled a bed or chair could be classed as an aid or appliance if it helped someone get dressed or undressed.  But Disability Rights UK told the BBC that what it called the "cumulative affect" of cuts to both benefits and social care was eroding the capacity for some disabled people to live independently.  Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said the changes would make it harder for some disabled people to qualify for the benefit.  "It is crucial that the PIP assessment accurately reflects the extra costs disabled people face," he said.  "Buying specialist equipment, adaptations and other aids are significant and ongoing extra costs for many disabled people."  And Labour's shadow minister for disabled people Debbie Abrahams said that the Conservative Party was "yet again ignoring the views of disabled people, carers and experts in the field".  And Dame Anne Begg, former chairwoman of the work and pensions committee and a wheelchair user, felt the changes were part of a government tactic to reduce overall the number of disability benefit claimants.  She told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "They've started at the wrong end - rather than looking at what people needed and the money they should get to cover the extra costs of disability, they've decided they wanted half a million less claimants.  "They've obviously drawn up the original criteria and discovered they're not cutting out as many people as they anticipated.  She acknowledged cutting a weekly benefit to cover a sometimes one-off payment "sounded sensible" but added: "These things, like needing a seat to sit down in the shower, act as a proxy because that probably also means you're unable to do some household chores... none of which are measureable under the present system.  "They're tightening these descriptors to make sure fewer people get the benefit."  A second independent review of PIP is due by April 2017.  Are you affected by the issues raised in this story?

Google's AlphaGo program was playing against Lee Se-dol in Seoul, in South Korea.  Mr Lee had been confident he would win before the competition started.  The Chinese board game is considered to be a much more complex challenge for a computer than chess.  "AlphaGo played consistently from beginning to the end while Lee, as he is only human, showed some mental vulnerability," one of Lee's former coaches, Kwon Kap-Yong, told the AFP news agency.  Mr Lee is considered a champion Go player, having won numerous professional tournaments in a long, successful career.  Go is a game of two players who take turns putting black or white stones on a 19-by-19 grid. Players win by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  In the first game of the series, AlphaGo triumphed by a very narrow margin - Mr Lee had led for most of the match, but AlphaGo managed to build up a strong lead in its closing stages.  After losing the second match to Deep Mind, Lee Se-dol said he was "speechless" adding that the AlphaGo machine played a "nearly perfect game".  The two experts who provided commentary for the YouTube stream of for the third game said that it had been a complicated match to follow.  They said that Lee Se-dol had brought his "top game" but that AlphaGo had won "in great style".  The AlphaGo system was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.  It has built up its expertise by studying older games and teasing out patterns of play. And, according to DeepMind chief executive Demis Hassabis, it has also spent a lot of time just playing the game.  "It played itself, different versions of itself, millions and millions of times and each time got incrementally slightly better - it learns from its mistakes," he told the BBC before the matches started.  This virtuous circle of constant improvement meant the super computer went into the five-match series stronger than when it beat the European champion late last year.  Artificial Intelligence (AI) has flirted with games since it's beginnings, because only smart humans excel. Unlike the real world, a closed system of fixed rules suits computing.  Despite critical voices, Arthur Samuel's draughts playing program was an incredible achievement in 1959. Like AlpahGo it learned by playing itself repeatedly only many orders of magnitude slower.  Then the goal posts moved. The critics said chess was beyond computing's capability because it needed human intuition and creativity. But then when good amateur challengers had to eat their words in the 1970s, the goal post shifted again.  Critics claimed a horizon where computers might beat some professionals but certainly not grand masters. So when IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer beat world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, the world was astonished. But Deep Blue was not the human-like intelligence that the founding fathers of AI had hoped for. It won by brute force by searching through millions of moves in seconds. Humans have limited memory and need brilliant pattern perception and creative strategies to win.  So the critics turned to Go as the impossible. Even with today's vast computer memories and incredibly fast processors (which have doubled more than eight times since Deep Blue), the ancient game will not yield to brute force. The size of the search required for Go is larger than chess by more than the number of atoms in the universe. It is the holy grail of AI gaming.  When Facebook announced earlier this year that their program had beaten a strong Go amateur, jaws dropped in the AI community - and fell to the floor that same day when Google's Deep Mind genius team announced their AlphaGo beat the European champion 5-0.  To beat one of the world's top players, Deep Mind used a mixture of clever strategies to make the search much smaller. They trained their machine on 30 million expert moves to start with, and then the learning machine played against itself millions of times. It worked - the holy grail is in the bag and the goal posts can shift no further.  Does this mean AI is now smarter than us and will kill us mere humans? Certainly not. AlphaGo doesn't care if it wins or looses. It doesn't even care if it plays and it certainly couldn't make you a cup of tea after the game. Does it mean that AI will soon take your job? Possibly you should be more worried about that.  Go is thought to date back to several thousand years ago in China.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves, compared with about 20 in chess - there are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.	tech

He told BBC Newsnight: "In recent weeks, when I've spoken up about this issue, I felt extremely pressured to be silent on the things I know to be true."  The Labour Party said any complaints or evidence of sexism or intimidation were dealt with fairly.  Mr Shuker raised his concerns in response to claims made by the charity Muslim Women's Network UK (MWN UK) concerning the "blocking" of vocal, independent Muslim women by male members of the Labour Party who are of Pakistani heritage.  MWN UK has called for an inquiry by the party into "systematic misogyny" within Labour.  Mr Shuker says: "I've been disappointed with the response of the Labour Party.  "I would like robust action from the leadership - both from the NEC and from the leader of the Labour Party to say 'If there are these practices, we will take time to root them out.'  "When people come forward with legitimate concerns, they should be backed, not silenced.  "This is not just a moral imperative; it's an electoral imperative. We can't carry on treating the Muslim community as fools - we need to serve up great candidates at every single level. The community knows when there are abuses of power."  Since its calls for an inquiry, MWN UK says it has heard of "sinister elements" within the party that leave women "fearing for their lives".  One Asian woman, a former Labour councillor, agreed to be interviewed by BBC Newsnight as long as her identity was kept hidden. She claimed Pakistani-heritage councillors on the English council where she served, who are still sitting councillors, regularly protect corrupt Asian businessmen.  On one occasion, "Zahara" says, the police presented councillors with a sexually explicit video as they ruled on whether to shut down a club.  She told Newsnight: "The decision ultimately should have been to close the establishment down because of inappropriate behaviours going on of a sexual nature between young white girls and Asian males that was being shown on the video.  "I was clearly told to stop questioning by a hand gesture and nudge by senior male councillors that were Asian who were sitting next to me… I was told: 'Do you know who it is? It's a very prominent Asian businessman that supports us'."  This woman claims that, on this occasion and many others, because she refused to do as these powerful councillors of Pakistani heritage demanded, they got her deselected.  When she arrived at the selection meeting, it was full of Asian people she had never seen before. "They're in the pocket of influential male councillors," she recalls.  "They were told to be there… and to vote a certain way. There were two or three young Asian males who found the courage to call me and say 'It's an absolute travesty, what happened.' I sent letters of complaint to the regional office and to head office of Labour and I was told there was no case to answer."  In some cases, the Labour Party has put individual wards into "special measures". That effectively means the selection process is taken out of local hands.  That has happened in Oldham where Arooj Shah is a councillor, though there is still resistance from some Labour members in her predominately Asian area, to a Muslim woman representing them  Cllr Shah says: "There's Labour Party members who will accept my two colleagues, Asian men, but support anyone but me. They're members of the local Labour party. They are shameless about it… It's because I'm a woman and anyone who sugar-coats it is lying."  Her ward colleagues are Muslim men and get far bigger majorities than she does. One, Cllr Shadab Qumer, described conversations he's had with local Labour members: "Some of them come up with derogatory comments, like 'Oh, she's a Muslim woman. She shouldn't be representing us.'  "Some of us have dragged them onside. We've got to integrate; where in Islam does it say a female can't represent us? It's a cultural thing, we've fought it."  Newsnight has spoken to other women who wanted to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. Many talked of clan politics perpetrated by these patriarchal communities, the so-called "biraderi", imported from the south Asian subcontinent, in which votes are delivered in blocks.  Many said threats and intimidation were used to force them out of politics.  One woman said: "I was standing to be a councillor and the big man of the Asian councillors came to my house to convince my husband to get me to stop down. It was frightening… They were threatening and scaring my family into getting me to step aside."  Another said: "I complained to Labour branch but they sided with the men. These men told them they would get more votes and members for them. My life was made hell after the complaint. The aggression was too much to bear.  "I'm a single mum and was worried about my daughter's safety. These men were capable of anything. In the end, I was deselected, despite all my commitment to the party."  Another ex-councillor explained how she was ousted: "I've no doubt I was deselected by Pakistani clan politics. There were around 100 people in the room. One of the local councillors had been recruiting family and friends to deselect me."  Muslim Women's Network UK (MWN UK) has written again to Jeremy Corbyn, saying it is "disappointed and unsatisfied" with Labour's response to the charity's calls for an inquiry.  In the letter, MWN UK says: "It would appear that our complaint is being tagged on to an existing Labour Party agenda item, and therefore that it is not being taken seriously and given the attention it deserves.  "The standard, lacklustre nature of the response received from the Labour Party is disappointing and undermines the women who have been brave enough to come forward and share their experiences.  "Such a response will not give women the confidence to come forward and speak to Labour Party officials in future."  MWN UK's Shaista Gohir told Newsnight: "What's worrying, these men have become a law unto themselves. That can't be in a vacuum, it's been going on for decades. Muslim men are saying to us 'We're glad you are saying what we've all known about. It just gets brushed under the carpet by senior Labour officials.'"  The Labour Party said it had been "at the forefront of the fight for women's equality".  It added: "We have transformed the representation of women in politics and championed equality for women in the workplace.  "Any complaints or evidence of sexism, intimidation, received by the Labour Party are dealt with fairly, according to our procedures and the law.  "Labour Party elected representatives are expected to maintain the highest standards of behaviour and conduct at all times.  "Any allegations of individual elected representatives whose behaviour falls short of that should be reported to the Labour Party or the appropriate authorities."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783651	Livingstone stands by Savile jibe at Jarvis donors	Ken Livingstone is standing by his comments about a hedge fund donation to a Labour MP being like "Jimmy Savile funding a children's group".  The former London Mayor told BBC News Dan Jarvis's acceptance of the cash showed he was not "genuinely Labour".  The Savile comment was branded "disgusting" by one Labour MP - and former home secretary Alan Johnson said he should "keep his trap shut".  Mr Jarvis, who is tipped as a future Labour leader, has yet to respond.  Mr Livingstone told BBC News: "All hedge fund managers want is to know that they're going to have a prime minister who's going to allow them to continue to evade tax and it's totally unacceptable for hedge fund managers to be contributing to anyone in the Labour Party.  "No-one in the Labour party who's genuinely Labour would want to take a penny from them."  Pressed on his choice of analogy, he said: "It's meant to be deliberately provocative because I'm saying to Dan Jarvis if you want to be a serious player in the Labour party, don't mix with these people, they're sick."  Mr Livingstone made the Savile comment in an interview with LBC Radio, after Mr Jarvis made a speech setting out his vision for returning Labour to power.  He said there is an "embittered group of old Blairites who are looking for someone to challenge Jeremy" and they think Dan Jarvis is "someone credible to run".  Alan Johnson has described Mr Livingstone's comments as "outrageously stupid," in an interview to be broadcast at 22:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.  He will add: "Ken should learn to keep his trap shut."  Labour MP Ian Austin, a frequent critic of Mr Corbyn, tweeted that Mr Livingstone's comments were "disgusting. Just disgusting."  Another Labour MP, Jamie Reed, told The Huffington Post: "There's no sewer so fetid that Ken won't swim in it.  "No regard for the victims, no regard for the pain and anger he will have caused, and no care for the damage he continues to do to Labour.  "It's another embarrassment. I look forward to his shame-faced apology for his latest sickening outburst."  Former shadow minister Michael Dugher, who was sacked by Mr Corbyn in his first reshuffle, was quoted as telling the Huffington Post's Paul Waugh: "Ken Livingstone is not fit to lace Dan Jarvis's boots."  Asked if he thought Mr Livingstone's comments were appropriate, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said: "Well Ken is Ken isn't he, really?"  He added he knew Dan Jarvis and he was "an honest and decent bloke who is making a major contribution to the Labour Party".  Mr McDonnell said he "welcomed" Mr Jarvis's speech, describing it as "part of the democratic debate on the Labour Party".  Mr Jarvis, a former paratrooper, is widely tipped as a future Labour leader.  In his speech on Thursday, he argued for a more "radical" approach to the economy than that pursued by New Labour in order to tackle inequality and win back voters.  According to the Register of Members' Interests, Mr Jarvis received £16,800 from hedge fund manager Martin Taylor in February to support his work as an MP.  Mr Taylor, who according to reports in January was closing his Nevsky Capital hedge fund, has been one of Labour's biggest personal donors in recent years.  Mr Jarvis was also given a donation of £12,500 in January from businessman Peter Hearn, who owns a financial recruitment agency.	politics

Mr Cameron had become "distracted" after the 2011 intervention in Libya, Mr Obama told the Atlantic magazine. He also described Libya as "a mess".  But in an email to the BBC, a White House spokesman said the US "deeply" valued the UK's contributions.  No 10 said the UK-US relationship remained "special and essential".  In the article Mr Obama reflected on "what went wrong" after the overthrowing of the Gaddafi regime, led by the UK and France.  "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up," he said.  Mr Obama said the UK prime minister soon became "distracted by a range of other things".  The US president said of the North African country: "We averted large-scale civilian casualties, we prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict. And despite all that, Libya is a mess."  He also spoke of "free riders", saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi - but, he said, the "habit" for several decades had been "people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game".  In its email to the BBC later, the White House said: "Prime Minister Cameron has been as close a partner as the president has had, and we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives which reflect our special and essential relationship."  On Libya, it said the president had always said "all of us... could have done more".  The White House also said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues", including a pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence.  According to the article, this pledge came after Mr Obama told Mr Cameron that Britain must pay its "fair share" if it wanted to continue to claim a "special relationship" with the US.  The prime minister's official spokeswoman said the relationship between the UK and US "remains a special and essential relationship, as both sides of the Atlantic have said and reiterated in the last day".  She said there was "regular dialogue" between the two leaders' offices on "a whole range of issues".  Responding to suggestions Mr Cameron had been angered by Mr Obama's comments, she said Libya had been "an extremely challenging situation".  She added: "We have done all we can. We think it has been the right approach to try and support a Libyan-led process and that is why we will continue to pursue that type of approach."  US ambassador in London Matthew Barzun told the BBC the relationship between the US and UK "is special and is essential".  He added: "The engagements between our countries' leaders are frequent and they publicly stand up together and talk about what's important. They privately talk all the time and I think that's really important and I wouldn't put over focus on one interview and one paper."  The "special relationship"- always more special to the UK than the US - has survived bigger strains: Suez, Vietnam; the Falklands; and the US invasion of Grenada, to name but a few.  So some disparaging remarks about a British prime minister from an American president doesn't really rate as earth-shattering.  Nonetheless, there is little doubt that No 10 were irritated.  At a press briefing yesterday his spokeswoman said the prime minister couldn't really let a leader - Colonel Gaddafi - torture and terrorise his own people.  The problem is that the president is now looking back on his two terms in the White House, while the PM is fighting for his future in an EU referendum.  So the US moved swiftly to patch up the rocky relationship, sending around the equivalent of flowers after a lovers' tiff in the form of fulsome praise for David Cameron.  But that came too late to avoid the collateral damage delivered to his reputation from the president's candid comments.  Former Conservative foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said criticism for the UK was "pretty rich" because the Americans "did far less" than France or the UK in the aftermath of the intervention.  Oliver Miles, former British ambassador to Libya, said he believed Mr Obama's comments about Mr Cameron being distracted had been "inaccurate" but were not a "big deal".  Andrew Mitchell, who was International Development Secretary during the invasion of Libya, said the President's comments were "extremely unfair and completely untrue".  "It was always clear that there wouldn't be boots on the ground. The House of Commons would never have agreed to British boots on the ground in Libya."  February 2011: Anti-Gaddafi protests erupt on the streets of the second-largest city, Benghazi, spreading to other cities  March 2011: The UN Security Council authorises a no-fly zone over Libya and air strikes to protect civilians. UK MPs vote to authorise military action  October 2011: Gaddafi is captured and killed by rebel fighters in the city of Sirte  The 2011 armed rebellion assisted by Western military intervention led to the end of Muammar Gaddafi's 42-year dictatorship. But it left a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.  Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival militia-backed parliaments.  A recent UN report said there were hundreds of armed groups and the chaos has allowed so-called Islamic State to gain a foothold.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783774	Week ahead	George Osborne's latest Budget will dominate the coming Commons week - indeed, fortnight - as MPs hear the Budget statement and then plunge into four days debate on its content.  The debates will be themed - but we don't know how, because that might provide a clue as to the content of the Budget.  The ritual of Budgets also provides Jeremy Corbyn with his sternest test yet, as Leader of the Opposition; responding to a budget, moments after it has been delivered is a fiendishly difficult assignment, requiring him to keep talking as a research team analyses the information the Chancellor has just provided and feeds him morsels of information and comment which have to be incorporated into the speech as they arrive.  At the same time, the Chancellor will face unusual scrutiny from his own side, as Leave campaigners in the EU Referendum search for subliminal (or overt) pro-Remain messages. He may even be accused, from his own side, of dispensing sweeteners and avoiding unpleasant medicine, to avoid losing referendum votes. It's hard to see how the Budget message can avoid being submerged by Referendum manoeuvring.  Elsewhere, there's plenty of serious legislating going on - notably the Commons debut of the Investigatory Powers Bill, and, in the Lords, the government is braced for a pretty tough week, with a series of defeats on assorted bills and secondary legislation.  First, there's what promises to be a highly tactical battle over the party funding provisions of the Trade Union Bill, where ministers may lose as many as six votes on balloting and political levies. And there may also be more defeats on the Immigration Bill.  Another, slightly longer term, issue to keep an eye on is the slow progress in the detailed scrutiny of the Housing and Planning Bill, where long speeches by a couple of peers have begun to provoke Tory murmurings about an unofficial filibuster.  Already, one extra day has been allocated for these debates, and it might not be the last - and if the bill were not to enter report stage before Easter that would seriously disrupt the legislative timetable. The announcement that the Queen's Speech will be on 18 May sets a deadline for the completion of outstanding parliamentary business - and a long Easter holiday and May day mini-break means there is less time left in the current session of Parliament than a glance at the calendar may suggest....  The Commons opens at 2.30pm with Work and Pensions questions - and any ministerial statements or urgent questions will be taken from 3.30pm.  The day's main legislating is on the Energy Bill, which delivers Conservative manifesto commitments to support investment in UK energy sources, and produce 30% of electricity from renewable sources by 2020. It sets up the Oil and Gas Authority as an independent regulator and ends new subsidies for onshore wind power.  There are some interesting amendments down for the report stage, with a variety on carbon capture and storage. But watch out for a cross party amendment from among others former Labour Leader (and Energy Secretary) Ed Miliband, the Greens' Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru's Hywel Williams, the SDLP's Dr Alasdair McDonnell, the Conservatives Graham Stuart and Daniel Poulter, and Labour's Paul Blomfield.  It requires that the energy secretary shall set a date by which net UK carbon emissions must be zero or lower ("the zero emissions year") by order no later than a year after the Energy Act 2016 comes into force.  In the Lords (2.30pm), the main event is the continuation (into day six of eight) of the committee stage of the Housing and Planning Bill. The issues will include secure tenancies and "pay to stay"; and they may reach the section on planning issues - although progress through these detailed debates has been at a snail's pace, and there is some suggestion that an extra day of committee may have to be scheduled which could push the report stage of this bill back beyond Easter.  During the dinner break there will be a debate marking the Centenary of the Battle of the Somme, led by the Conservative historian, Lord Lexden.  The Commons (11.30am) the day begins with Business, Innovation and Skills questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from Labour's Caroline Flint.  She wants to ensure that details of the cross-border tax arrangements of multi-national companies are not only disclosed to HMRC, but also made public. The idea is to highlight where companies are using complicated arrangements to minimise their tax liability. As a member of the powerful Public Accounts Committee, she took part in the hearings with companies like Google - and this bill is one result of that experience. The PAC seems increasingly keen to use this kind of device to highlight the findings of its inquiries.  The main event is the second reading of the Investigatory Powers Bill , which will be the opening move in what looks likely to be an intensive parliamentary battle (see previous blog post). And then MPs debate a de-proscription order on the International Sikh Youth Foundation, under the Terrorism Act 2000 - removing it from the list of banned organisations.  In the Lords (2.30pm), peers continue their detailed report stage scrutiny of the Immigration Bill - where the government lost two votes this week. The key issues include the right to rent, the offence of driving by illegal immigrants, the health surcharge, immigration detention, depart first - appeal later, and the treatments of unaccompanied asylum seeker children- watch out for votes and quite possibly further government defeats on issues around detention of vulnerable people.  During the dinner break there is a regret motion from Labour Justice Spokesman, Lord Beecham, on the Civil Proceedings, Family Proceedings and Upper Tribunal Fees (Amendment) Order - it might be pushed to a vote. Labour and the Lib Dems are getting quite competitive about opposing statutory instruments put down by the government.  The Commons day opens (11.30am) with International Development questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's question time. And then comes the Budget - in the subsequent debate watch out for interventions foreshadowing an amendment to the Finance Bill (the measure which puts the Budget into effect) to help women left poorer by state pension age rises - the pension age for women will rise to 65 in November 2018 and 66 by October 2020.  In the Lords (from 3pm) the crucial report stage consideration of the Trade Union Bill begins. The crux of the debate will be the amendment from Crossbencher and former civil servant Lord Burns who chaired a special select committee examining the impact of the bill on party funding.  Labour peers believe proposed opt-in rules for paying into union political funds will devastate the finances of their party. Lord Burns will propose changes that would substantially reduce the impact by applying the opt-in only to new union members. It looks likely there will be a majority for his amendment, so long as the vote is held before the dinner break, when peers often drift away from the Chamber.  As noted above, other defeats may follow - the other issues at play include ballot thresholds, e-balloting, union annual returns, and facility time for union officials, and the government may offer a bit of wriggle room around some technical issues.  But it wants Labour, in particular, to accept the principle of union members opting in to paying money to political parties. If that principle is rejected by the Lords, there are some in Tory high command who would relish the chance to impose the bill via the Parliament Act; if that happens, the bill becomes law in the form in which it left the Commons, which would mean losing the concessions already offered on allowing e-voting for union ballots, for example, which would mean they would be required to introduce a paper based opt-in process for the political levy, within a matter of months.  It's quite a threat and the interesting question is whether Labour and the other critics will be prepared to negotiate a compromise. There's certainly no prospect of the government agreeing a quid pro quo where it promises to introduce restrictions on individual political donations - they argue that Labour introduced curbs on company political funding without any compensating curbs on their own donations.  There may also be a vote on the dinner break business - a regret motion from Lib Dem Baroness Featherstone on the Renewables Obligation Order that ends early the subsidy for small solar installations, which may provide a desert for the Opposition after the main course in the bill.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with a series of mini-question times: three quarters of an hour on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; and then half an hour for the MPs who speak in the Commons for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission - and that will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, and then, the continuation of the Budget debate.  In Westminster Hall, there's a backbench debate on cabin air safety and aerotoxic syndrome led by Jonathan Reynolds, Graham Brady and Dawn Butler. This follows the results of a series of inquests which suggest cabin crew may be at risk  In the Lords (11am), the Housing and Planning Bill committee stage grinds into day seven, with peers due to look at issues around planning and compulsory purchase.  And neither House sits on Friday.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783047	McDonnell vows 'responsible' rules to control Labour spending	A future Labour government would control public spending through a "fiscal credibility" lock, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.  Under his plan, day-to-day spending would not exceed government income although there would be scope for borrowing for capital investment.  "There is nothing left wing about excessive spending, nothing socialist about too much debt", he said.  The Tories said Labour had a history of spending and borrowing too much.  And Spencer Livermore, a former aide to Ed Miliband, said the policy was scarcely different from what Labour offered at the last election and the party risked "repeating its mistakes".  Mr McDonnell's announcement comes five days before the Budget, in which Chancellor George Osborne is widely expected to confirm the UK's economic performance has deteriorated in recent months and announce further spending cuts to reduce the deficit, forecast to be £73.5bn this year.  The shadow chancellor said this was an "astonishing turnaround" from Mr Osborne's more upbeat assessment of the UK's economic prospects at the time of November's Spending Review and that the chancellor was now having to "admit shamefaced" that the outlook was not so rosy.  Labour is under pressure to demonstrate it can be trusted on the economy after its election defeat, which was widely blamed on its failure to convince the public it had a plan to control public spending and borrowing, boost growth and raise living standards.  Labour insisted that the new rule was not a commitment to spend more money than the present government.  Chancellor George Osborne has put in place rules saying that the government will create an overall budget surplus "in normal times".  Labour voted against the rule in Parliament, and Mr McDonnell said any future Labour government wanted to invest more than the Conservatives. Which could mean more borrowing.  The Office for Budget Responsibility - the government's economic watchdog - will be given new powers to "whistle blow" when it believes that the "credibility rule" has been breached. And under the Labour plans it will also report to Parliament rather than the Treasury. Read more  Under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, Labour has been more vocal in its opposition to austerity but efforts to build a coherent economic policy suffered a setback when Mr McDonnell did a U-turn over his support for the government's deficit reduction plan in the face of opposition from his MPs.  In a speech in London, Mr McDonnell - a key ally of Mr Corbyn's who is also on the left of the party - insisted Labour must have a plan to get the public finances back into the black but, unlike the government, it will do so in a "fair and responsible manner".  Under its new "fiscal credibility" framework, a future Labour government would be obliged to keep day-to-day spending in balance with tax returns and other revenues generated by the government to ensure there is no annual current deficit.  It would also commit to reducing overall government debt - the total aggregate of government borrowing which currently stands at £1.5 trillion - during the lifetime of the next Parliament, expected to begin in 2020, and every Parliament after that.  However, the new rules, which Labour says will be "scrupulously" enforced by the Office for Budget Responsibility, will leave room for more borrowing to pay for capital expenditure in infrastructure such as roads, railways, homes and energy.  "The fiscal credibility rule is not about making spending commitments," Mr McDonnell insisted. "It is about providing a framework for the responsible management of public finances," he said.  "We must be a party that thinks first about how we earn money, not only how we spend money."  "There is nothing left-wing about excessive spending," he will add. "There is nothing socialist about running up too much debt. When governments do not manage their finances responsibly, it is ordinary working people who eventually suffer.  "When governments try to disguise their spending, it is accountability and democracy that suffer."  Since the mid-1990s, Gordon Brown and his successors have adopted a succession of fiscal rules in order to try and demonstrate Labour's discipline in public spending.  Under Ed Miliband's leadership, Labour proposed to reduce the deficit every year and balance the books, in terms of current spending, during the lifetime of the current Parliament.  It is also pledged to get debt as a share of GDP falling but made no firm commitment on borrowing to invest in infrastructure.  The Conservative government has gone further, targeting a £10bn surplus in both current and capital spending by 2019-2020 and aiming for a continuous budget surplus "in normal times" thereafter.  Many economists believe Mr Osborne will have to revise his targets because of lower growth forecasts, affecting his ability to hit borrowing targets.  The Conservatives dismissed Mr McDonnell's announcement, claiming Labour "hadn't learnt their lesson and couldn't be trusted on the economy".  "Labour spent and borrowed too much last time they were in power. At a time of uncertainty in the global economy, Labour is serious threat to our economic security and it is working people who will pay the price."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35782859	Navigating the Internet of Things	It's now almost a cliche that the future of the internet is things. According to the research firm Gartner there are already more than six million devices connected to the internet, and that will grow to more than 20 billion by 2020.  Too often, though, the Internet of Things (IoT) seems like a vague abstraction - we are told it's a revolution that will change our lives but it's often not clear how. So in today's edition of Tech Tent we explore some practical examples, and we examine the key question of who will own the ocean of data which will flow from all these connected things.  You might not expect a company which makes window blinds to be evangelical about IoT but when we visited the Ecobuild conference in London a firm called Umbra Shading was eager to show us how it was embracing IoT technology. Its motorised blinds for large office buildings are designed to adapt to the conditions outside, opening and closing when they judge more or less light is needed.  "The blinds are intelligently pulling data from the cloud," Umbra's chief executive Nigel Hill explains. That data includes the current and forecast weather. "We hear a lot about big data - what I'm excited about is we're using that for a relatively simple everyday problem like sunshading."  If the construction industry is just getting to grips with IoT technology, the farm machinery giant John Deere has been pioneering its use for years. Its tractors and combine harvesters have been "things" connected to the internet for more than a decade, making autonomous farm vehicles which can drive themselves to an accuracy of two or three centimetres. This is all part of the precision agriculture revolution which means, for instance, that there's no overlapping when a field is sown with seed or sprayed with fertiliser.  "We're on a journey to get more and more precise," John Deere's Ron Zinc tells me. With the world's population set to grow from seven billion to 9.5 billion by 2050, he says, "the challenge is to do more with less and this data-driven agriculture will do that".  Firms like John Deere and Monsanto are now collecting vast amounts of data from their customers, which they say will help other farmers work out how best to manage their land. Ron Zinc insists it's clear who is in charge - "the customer controls their data - it's the growers' data" - but as the value of this information grows, we can expect more conflicts over who has the right to share it and manipulate it.  Which is where the Hub of All Things or HAT comes in. This is a social enterprise which aims to create a way of giving consumers something called a HAT - a personal data store. Irene Ng, a University of Warwick economist who's one of the leaders of this project, explains to me that we all have more and more data - information on our shopping habits collected by online retailers, our location and health details stored on our mobile phones, and increasingly data collected from the IoT.  "This data that we are giving away is our behaviours. What we are saying is that there is a lot more we can do with it if we take it back and if we can grab some of it back to the HAT we can combine it." She makes the point that companies holding your data aren't allowed to share it with other organisations - but we are. So for instance we could take our spending record with a supermarket and share it with an online retailer. "It's your data - once you've taken it back you could exchange it for discounts and promotions."  It is an intriguing, perhaps revolutionary, idea - but convincing us all that we need to learn how to own and share our data will be a challenge. This week the UK's competition regulator outlined plans to release the data of people who had not switched energy suppliers for three years, to rival energy firms so that they could be targeted with offers.  Immediately, concerns were raised about privacy and the threat that vulnerable people might be spammed with hundreds of emails and letters. It would obviously be preferable if energy users could take control of their own data - and choose to offer it to firms which might give them better deals. The problem is that it's those who most need to save money on heating bills who may be least likely to master this new data era.

The UK established the 834,000-sq-km (322,000-sq-mile) zone around the Pitcairn Islands in the Pacific in 2015.  Data gathered by the drone will be beamed back to a satellite watch room to help prosecute unauthorised trawling.  The drones will patrol areas in the reserve designated as no-fishing zones.  The drone, made by US firm Liquid Robotics, will be directed by staff at the satellite watch room which is monitoring fishing vessels. The craft is equipped with a camera that can take snaps of fishing vessels that are in restricted areas, and satellite technology that can pinpoint their location. The unmanned craft starting patrolling late last month.  The Liquid Robotics drone, called a Wave Glider, is a two-part craft made up of an instrument-bearing boat that floats on the ocean surface that is tethered to a submersible. The craft uses the differential motion between the sea surface and the region the submersible traverses to propel itself.  The self-propelling propulsion system means the Wave Glider can stay at sea for months at a time.  The UK established the marine-protected area in the Pitcairns in 2015 and, at the same time, created a watchdog organisation that would try to protect its abundant sea life from fishing.  The Pitcairn reserve is believed to be home to more than 1,200 species of fish, marine mammals and birds - some of which are unique to the region. It also supports the world's deepest and most well-developed coral reef.  The watch room to oversee the region has been created in the Harwell science park in Oxfordshire with funding from the UK government and the Swiss Bertarelli Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts.	tech

The customer from Ohio, known as Caleb, asked Mr Cook whether closing down "multitasking apps" improved battery life and whether it was something the chief executive did himself.  Senior vice-president Craig Federighi replied "no and no".  However, other smartphone batteries can benefit from app closure.  Microsoft advises Nokia Lumia owners to close apps that aren't in use on a web page about extending battery life.  "You can view and optimise your device through closing running apps and uninstalling unnecessary apps," said Samsung in an announcement about a new "smart manager" app for the Galaxy 6.  While many Apple users do shut down apps in the belief it extends the iPhone battery this is not advice explicitly given by the firm itself.  It only recommends disabling apps from carrying out background refreshes in a list of tips about saving power.  The BBC has contacted Apple for comment.  Former chief executive Steve Jobs would sometimes reply directly to unsolicited emails - generally in very few words - but Tim Cook appears to be less forthcoming.  Caleb shared his unusual correspondence with the website 9to5mac.  "On a technical level, most of the apps are either frozen in RAM or not running at all, the system just displays them as a history for consistency. This is why the battery life impact is negligible," reporter Benjamin May notes.  Caleb himself appears to be surprised by the attention the emails received.  "That went more viral than I thought it would," he tweeted.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35783558	Adobe issues emergency patch for Flash bug	Adobe has issued an emergency patch for its Flash media player that closes loopholes in the widely used software.  In its security advisory, Adobe said one of the bugs was being actively exploited in a "limited number of targeted attacks".  In total, the patch closes 23 separate security bugs in the Flash player.  Attackers abusing the security holes would be able to take over a computer to steal useful data or spy on the machine's owner.  The update urges people to apply the patch as soon as possible because many of the problems are rated as critical - the highest level.  The holes are found in versions of the Flash player used on many different platforms and devices including Windows machines, Macs and Linux computers as well as phones running Android and iOS.  Adobe was alerted to the problems with its Flash player by many different security researchers including experts at Google, Microsoft, Kaspersky Labs and Alibaba.  Many security firms now recommend that people uninstall the Flash player to avoid falling victim to malicious attachments or booby-trapped webpages. A lot of web firms have now stopped using Flash in a bid to thwart attackers.  Several other companies issued big security patches this week. Firefox's update closed 40 separate vulnerabilities, more than half of which were rated as critical.  In addition, Google issued an update for Chrome that, among other things, closed three security holes rated as "high" severity. It paid bug bounties totalling $13,000 (£9,000) to the two researchers who uncovered the loopholes.  On Tuesday, Microsoft issued its regular monthly security update that tackled 13 problems in several different programs including the Internet Explorer and Edge browsers.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35779133	BBC Two to screen documentary on 'misunderstood' House of Lords	BBC Two has commissioned a series filmed inside the House of Lords which it says will give "unprecedented" insight into peers' work.  The three-part documentary series, produced by independent company Top Hat, will be aired later this year.  Filming will take place over several months, in a format similar to the Inside the Commons documentary which was broadcast on BBC Two last year.  It aims to "see how public perception stacks up to reality", the BBC says.  The House of Lords has been under renewed scrutiny since it acted to delay tax credit cuts in October 2015.  The controversial move prompted the government to launch a review of the Lords' powers, which recommended they should lose their absolute veto over secondary legislation.  The BBC says the documentary will show the "characters" who populate the upper chamber and "their aims, dilemmas and frustrations".  The programme will take in the current arguments about whether, and how, to pursue reform of the House of Lords.  Fiona Campbell, head of BBC Current Affairs, hailed it as a chance "to shed some light for our viewers on the inner workings of this long-standing pillar of politics in this country".  Lord Speaker Baroness D'Souza said: "The House of Lords is often misunderstood because there are few opportunities for the public to find out about its role and work."  She described the series as an "opportunity to see the important work that is done by the House".  Peers held a debate in January on their public image in which a number of members complained about the lack of understanding of their role and the way they are portrayed in the press.  Lord Hodgson of Astley-Abbots, who tabled the debate, expressed his concern about "the rising number of snide, unfounded and unhelpful articles about your Lordships' House that are quite unconnected with our legislative activities".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35783771	The whys and wherefores: Sunday Trading and EVEL	Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, the procedural tangles created by EVEL - English Votes for English Laws - continue to baffle MPs.  This week's Commons debate on the Enterprise Bill saw ministers bewildered, and indeed Deputy Speaker Lindsay Hoyle openly admitted he didn't know what was going on.  And outsiders might have been pretty confused, too.  For a start, why did an amendment to change the rules on Sunday Trading in England and Wales not invoke EVEL?  Well, the clause it applied to dealt with employment rights, which are a UK-wide issue. For the powers of EVEL to be called down upon the Commons, the issue involved must (1) arise in a government bill, (2) apply only to one segment of the UK (England or England and Wales, say) and (3) deal with a matter where the devolved legislatures could pass an equivalent statute, if so minded.  These rules have a number of interesting implications - for example, Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland MPs would have a vote on a private member's bill to designate an English national anthem.  But back to Sunday trading - and that clause fell foul of the third condition, because its drafting bundled a right to opt out of Sunday working together with devolving the regulation of trading hours to local authorities. That combination was the actual stumbling block here. Mr Speaker has to certify bills as subject to the EVEL rules clause by clause....  So the whole clause had to be exempt.  I don't know if this was accident or design, but it certainly highlights an area where a government could game the EVEL rules and try to ensure that certain clauses were not eligible for the process.  Another EVEL point is that, although the removal of the clause on Sunday trading would not have happened but for Scottish votes (if Scottish MPs had abstained from the division, the government would have had a majority of 21), the EVEL rules (and there are 30 pages of Commons standing orders setting out the procedure) provide no way of putting it back.  The English Grand Committee, which is the vehicle for English-only voting, can block parts of a bill, but not add to it.  At least in this Parliament, where we have a government whose majority rests on English MPs, it is very hard to see EVEL being deployed to amend a bill; a future government would have a harder time if it did not have a majority of English MPs, but for the time being, its little more than a parliamentary ritual.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35780442	The gifs that keep on giving	When promoting last month's long-awaited comeback of The X-Files, the show's creator - Fox - sought Giphy's help.  Fox wanted the company to chop the new episode up into little pieces and make a series of animated gifs - those blinking, forever-looping, silent clips millions share every day.  When the show aired, Giphy was able to "live gif" the broadcast on social media. Fans lapped it up, sharing the new gifs thousands of times.  "They're able to speak in that show's voice," said Julie Logan, Giphy's director of brand strategy.  Giphy is a search engine for animated gifs. You describe the gif you want, and it'll load it up ready for sharing.  The three-year-old firm is valued at $300m (£210m), thanks to a recent $55m investment round. Huge money, you might think, for a format that is among the most primitive the web has to offer.  But really, that's the point.  A fixture of 90s internet, the animated gif was, for a while, the only way to give a webpage some sign of life. It's not a video, rather a series of lots of images played in sequence, like a flipbook.  Once newer technologies like Flash came along, gifs fell out of favour and instead became associated with cheap, tacky web design.  But the humble gif has made a comeback as the good-guy of the internet.  Gifs don't force a pre-roll advertisement on you before you can watch it. It won't rudely start playing audio when you don't want it to, nor will it plant a tracking cookie on your machine so companies can flog ads at you. And so, as user experiences go, the gif deserves to be treasured.  "It's a really powerful medium," says Ms Logan. "It's had a rebirth as a more creative medium. It's a new kind of art.  "It's short. It's like the punchline of a joke. Or just a little smile - that little kick of emotion."  Those little jokes are often made using images from popular culture - movies, TV stars, musicians. Expressive faces made by Taylor Swift, or classic lines from the film Mean Girls.  The fun derived is the online equivalent of quoting a movie out loud when with friends. The enjoyment comes not just from the humour of the line, but that bond of being among people who enjoy the same things you do.  Giphy's search engine is powerful, quick and an adventure into the perky side of the internet.  But right now, and you probably saw this coming, it's not making any money. As many start-up types say to help themselves sleep at night, Giphy is "pre-revenue".  But investors must see something - a way to spin money out of a format which is popular partly because nobody yet has.  "People have been sharing gifs for a long time," says Ms Logan. "It was something the content creators were not always involved in.  "What we're trying to do is connect those dots."  When people use Giphy, not only do they find gifs, but they also get directed to where the gif originated - be it a movie, YouTube clip or otherwise.  For the people who create those products - like the makers of the X-Files - Giphy wants them to see gifs as an opportunity to push what they call "branded language". You're talking to friends, but through the medium of your favourite film stars. By getting involved, studios can have at least some control over quality and distribution.  And it isn't just Fox. HBO, record label Interscope and several others have come to Giphy to help.  "When Game of Thrones puts out these trailers, they want their fans to talk about it," explains Ms Logan.  "A lot of those conversations are happening in gifs."  As to how they'll make money, Ms Logan says we should look at how Google profits from its search.  So - companies will eventually be able to pay Giphy for their gifs to appear higher up in search results, on the understanding they're likely to be used more often. And in future, tie-ups with TV and movie studios may be another considerable stream of income for the firm.  What won't change, however, is the gif itself - you won't be seeing ads slapped all over them. It would go against everything that has made them popular again.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35778000	Could Labour plotters oust Jeremy Corbyn as leader?	"We need to have more courage," a Labour MP, newly elected last year, confided to me in the corridors of Westminster.  "Lots of people are talking about a battle of ideas. But that can wait. There is nothing more important than ditching Jeremy Corbyn."  An ex-minister close to the former leader Gordon Brown was, in private, even more robust: "Labour is facing an existential threat.  "If Jeremy Corbyn leads us in to the 2020 election, it's all over for the party. We are screwed."  While some in the parliamentary party rail against their leader, others are more resigned to his continuation in office - and the consequences. A former minister close to another former leader - Tony Blair - declared: "I find a new reason to despair every day."  And some of their colleagues who attended a meeting of Labour's Parliamentary party on Monday night were incensed by reports of how the proceedings were briefed by Mr Corbyn's spokesman.  He had characterised the meeting as marking the night the Labour mainstream sided with Jeremy Corbyn, who had face down his internal opponents.  The leader had called for unity and told his MPs to stop "sniping" - and they in turn had tempered their criticism. There had been a "sea change in attitudes" said the spokesman.  Some of those present did not recognise this account and the "sea change" appears, in fact, to be a hardening of the attitudes of those who want Jeremy Corbyn ousted.  There has been a lot of shadow boxing between a Parliamentary Labour Party which overwhelmingly opposed Mr Corbyn's election as leader - and members and supporters who delivered it.  But now, at the very least, a minority of MPs seem more determined than ever to mount a challenge sooner rather than later.  The May elections in Scotland, Wales, London and English local authorities are set to be spun by Mr Corbyn's allies and critics alike.  At Monday's meeting the party leader refused to be drawn on how many council seats he expects to win (or lose).  That is meant to make it trickier for opponents to declare he has failed.  But party insiders believe 200 or more seats in England are vulnerable.  So the Corbynistas are responding in two ways.  The successor to the Corbyn leadership campaign - Momentum - will try to put well motivated activists into areas which are vulnerable.  With poor turnouts in many council contests, it's possible a good "ground war" could reap benefits and stem losses - or even lead to some unexpected gains. Momentum bussed supporters into the Oldham West by-election late last year.  The assumption was that Labour might just scrape home on a low turnout - in fact a relatively respectable 40% went to the polls, and Labour's vote share increased.  But even if council results turn out to be disappointing, the leadership are confident Sadiq Khan will defeat Zac Goldsmith in the London mayoral contest and that Labour won't slip to third place in Scotland.  And this will be presented as proof that Jeremy Corbyn's leadership is far from toxic and he needs more time to mobilise further support for the party.  In this narrative, setbacks elsewhere will have been due to the Parliamentary "snipers" shooting their own leader in the foot.  On the other side, senior MPs are circulating a paper pointing out how well Labour should be doing at this stage in the electoral cycle.  It concludes that opposition parties have always gained seats over the past 40 years except in 1982 - when Labour was in opposition but suffered the SDP split - and in 1985 when the Militant Tendency and the miners' strike were in the headlines.  So some former ministers are likely to set targets of their own for Jeremy Corbyn - anything less than 300 gains will be denounced as unsatisfactory.  So let's assume - and this is not a prediction, just a scenario - that some Labour MPs will say Jeremy Corbyn has failed to clear the hurdles they have constructed for him. The rules are clear that it would take 20% of the combined total of Labour MPs and MEPs - 51 politicians - to trigger a leadership challenge.  But It's less clear if Jeremy Corbyn's name would then automatically be on the ballot.  The rule book here is open to interpretation.  One Corbyn opponent points out that when Tony Benn challenged the incumbent Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, the latter was required to gather nominations, too - and he says this would set a precedent.  And Labour officials stress the importance of "custom and practice" when determining these issues.  That would mean Mr Corbyn would then have to gather 35 nominations from his fellow MPs to stand, if challenged.  He only gained that number last year because some of his Parliamentary colleagues wanted to "broaden the debate" and didn't expect him to win.  So it's possible he could be kept off the ballot. And that would be the best opportunity opponents would have to defeat him.  A YouGov poll of party members in February suggested if Jeremy Corbyn were on the ballot paper, he would win a leadership contest comfortably, with "soft-left" shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn second, and ex-paratrooper Dan Jarvis - who gave a keynote speech on Thursday in which he denounced inequality and distanced himself, to a degree, from New Labour - narrowly behind in third place.  However, members were also shown a ballot paper without Jeremy Corbyn's name on it - and Hilary Benn, Tom Watson, Angela Eagle and Dan Jarvis were pretty much bunched together in that order.  So, unsurprisingly, Mr Corbyn's supporters in the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy are trying to make the rules less ambiguous - by getting the party's sovereign body, the annual conference, to agree that if challenged, the leader's name would automatically be on any ballot - and in future only 5%, not 15%, of MPs would need to nominate a candidate if Mr Corbyn were to stand down.  This would mean about a dozen MPs would have to give their backing. As Jeremy Corbyn had 14 genuine supporters in the Parliamentary party at last year's leadership contest, this lower threshold would mean a left-wing successor could not be blocked by their sceptical Parliamentary colleagues.  They would then put themselves before a membership whose centre of gravity is to the left of most Labour MPs for approval.  So that is why some of those who were close to either Blair or Brown believe it is worth trying to challenge the current leader before his position becomes more entrenched.  But despite all the talk about rules, privately the plotters believe that even if Mr Corbyn were required to seek nominations from fellow MPs to re-stand, due to a mixture of patronage and the fear of being deselected by new left-wing party members, it's perfectly possible that 35 MPs would support him this time in any case.  If so, any challenger would have their work cut out, according to that You Gov membership survey.  Two thirds of respondents said they wanted Jeremy Corbyn to lead Labour into the next general election. But crucially, asked if he should do so even if the May elections go badly for Labour, 53% of members would still want him to remain as leader until at least 2020.  So now there isn't just a division between most Labour MPs and their leader.  Amongst the non-Corbynistas, there are those that say it would be pointless to launch a leadership contest he is likely to win - and those who say they have to be seen to be making the argument that he is leading the party to disaster.  The mood between the two camps isn't quite as convivial as it once was.  A member of the latter group privately denounced the former as "collaborators". Members of this albeit fluid grouping - "there isn't a Committee to Get Rid of Jeremy Corbyn", said one MP - are coming to the conclusion that a leadership challenge is worth a roll of the dice.  But would Mr Corbyn simply fall on his sword if May's elections bring poor results?  Some MPs say he isn't enjoying the job but a well-connected former Labour strategist is convinced he wouldn't step aside.  He says sections of the press - and Parliament - are "using the wrong metric to look at his success and failure".  He believes "those around him want to take on and change the party before thinking about trying to change the country - so winning elections isn't their priority".  So if he won't go of his own volition, July seems to be the likely time for a challenge.  As Dan Jarvis pointed out in his remarks to Westminster journalists on Thursday, Labour members and supporters would not forgive MPs who are entirely focussed on May's elections and June's referendum.  But whenever a contest comes, Mr Corbyn's backers are confident he would win because the mood amongst the membership is against a return to "top down" politics and Parliamentary coups.  They don't buy the idea that, whatever the rules, it would be possible to exclude a leader who gained an overwhelming mandate just six months ago.  A leading light in Momentum put it like this: "They can challenge Jeremy if they want. Just so long as they know it would be a kamikaze operation."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35752662	Click: How we made the BBC's first 360-degree show	In a world first, BBC TV's tech show Click is about to transmit a special 360-degree edition.  It will contain never-before-broadcast views of Cern's Large Hadron Collider, an immersive video games review and a conjuring trick in which the magician could not hide anything from sight.  Audiences will also be able to stream an interactive version, which they can experience via virtual-reality headsets.  Making the programme was no easy feat, as its presenter and producer explain.  "Cameras running. Action!" shouts Steve. I stand there, looking awkwardly at the camera, and do nothing. Except start counting to 10 in my head.  Normally, I'd have launched into my piece to camera at those words, but on this special shoot we have to give the audience "landing time" to get their bearings and then turn around to see what's behind them.  During that awkward silence, you might spot another difference from our normal programme.  There are no "behind-the-scenes".  Everyone is in shot at all times, so had better be doing something useful.  That meant the camera operator often had to play-act after hitting "record".  Mind you, first they had to start each of six GoPro cameras in the cubic constellation we were using. Then they had to do a weird clapping dance that wouldn't be out of place in a flamenco show.  This was to provide an audio and visual synchronisation point for each of the video files, so they could be stitched later. At least, that's what Steve said.  Personally, I think he was compensating for the sitting around that followed.  Then it was my turn, and here's the third difference on a 360 shoot: one-take wonders.  You might think we film everything in one take anyway, but a normal 2D Click consists of shot changes every few seconds - close-ups of points of interest mentioned in the voiceover, general shots to cover edits we make in my or the guest's talky bits.  We decided it would be incredibly jarring to cut to different shots in 360, so for the most part, each two-to-five minute section was recorded "as-live", in one take. My words, interviewee's answers, and, in one case, a massive pool of water overflowing and nearly soaking our shoes.  As a presenter, it feels much more "live" than normal. The energy is higher, you can have more fun and be freer, knowing that whatever you do, and wherever you go, it will be in shot, with no need for repeats in close-up.  Whenever you want to talk about something, you just point to it, and let the audience look around. It's a lot less formal, and more like talking to a person than a camera.  But there's a lot of pressure to get everything right in one go, and it tends to go best after a good dose of the three R's: rehearse, rehearse, rehearse.  Of course, not every story works in 360, and this has certainly been an education in telling them in a compelling way without all the usual tricks of exciting cutaways and fast edits.  What happens next - the post-production - is a whole world of weird. But that's Steve's story.  You can follow Spencer on Twitter @spenley.  Nearly all 360 camera rigs - including ours - share one problem: parallax.  If you watch most of their videos carefully, you might see some strange things happen.  Perhaps someone's body will be briefly chopped in two as they circle the camera, or an arm might split into multiple ghostly limbs.  The problem happens because each camera lens involved is in a slightly different place.  The issue became apparent when we "stitched" the recordings together.  Where the footage overlapped, what each camera saw was a tiny bit different.  You can replicate the effect yourself.  Hold a finger right in front of your nose, and alternately close each eye. Your finger will jump into different positions. Open both eyes and your finger might look a little ghostly.  Fixing the parallax problem for 360 videos takes a huge amount of time, sweat and clever software - and sometimes it's just impossible. You'll certainly see a few ghosts if you watch the Click 360 show carefully enough.  What we and other 360 producers are doing is the equivalent of the first grainy attempts at film over a century ago.  Many of the problems that we wrestled with will probably be solved by the next generation of kit and software.  And the more people make things, the more we'll all discover about what works best in this new 360 world.  It's pretty exciting, and once I've had a little liedown, maybe I'll start thinking about Click 720.  You can view it from all angles using a simple web browser.

Speaking to the Atlantic magazine, he said the operation went as well as he had hoped, but Libya was now "a mess".  The article also said he had warned the PM the UK would have to pay its "fair share" and spend 2% of GDP on defence.  In response, Number 10 said there were "many difficult challenges" in Libya, while the White House said it deeply valued the UK's contributions.  Downing Street did not comment on President Obama's remark to the PM about defence spending, reportedly made before Chancellor George Osborne said the government would fulfil a Nato pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence last year.  In response to the interview, a spokesman for the US National Security Council said Mr Cameron had been "as close a partner as the president has had" adding that "we deeply value the UK's contributions on our shared national security and foreign policy objectives".  BBC North America editor Jon Sopel said the unsolicited statement put out by the White House suggested Downing Street had reacted angrily to the article.  "It's like we've seen a curtain drawn back on the unspun thoughts of President Obama, complete with frustration as well, and what we've seen tonight is the White House trying to close the curtain as quickly as it can," he added.  The toppling of the Gaddafi regime in Libya - following UN-backed air strikes designed to protect civilians - led to a power vacuum and instability, with no authority in full control.  The intervention was led by the UK and France - and in his interview, Mr Obama reflects on "what went wrong", saying: "There's room for criticism, because I had more faith in the Europeans, given Libya's proximity, being invested in the follow-up."  Mr Cameron, he said, became "distracted by a range of other things". He also criticised former French President Nicolas Sarkozy, saying he had tried to claim the spotlight.  The former French president, he said, "wanted to trumpet the flights he was taking in the air campaign, despite the fact that we had wiped out all the air defences and essentially set up the entire infrastructure" for the intervention.  President Obama said the intervention "averted large-scale civilian casualties (and) prevented what almost surely would have been a prolonged and bloody civil conflict". But he added: "And despite all that, Libya is a mess."  He also criticised what he called "free riders" in the interview, saying European and Gulf countries were calling for action against Gaddafi, adding: "But what has been a habit over the last several decades in these circumstances is people pushing us to act but then showing an unwillingness to put any skin in the game."  Despite efforts to support Libya's National Transitional Council, and the first elections in the country for decades, it rapidly descended into violence, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.  In January, Mr Cameron told MPs the "Libyan people were given the opportunity" to build a stable democracy - and it was a matter of "huge regret" they had not taken it.  He stressed that - unlike in Iraq - the post-conflict planning was locally driven.  "Gaddafi was bearing down on people in Benghazi and threatening to shoot his own people like rats," he said. "An international coalition came together to protect those people and to help the Libyan people, who then got rid of Gaddafi.  "And they had an opportunity to build what they said they wanted."  Responding to President Obama's interview, Downing Street said "coming to the aid of innocent civilians who were being tortured and killed by their leader was the right thing to do".  The government has tried to support stability in Libya and is "working hard to support the UN-led process to establish a stable and inclusive government that will allow them to build a peaceful future", a spokesman said.  "But ultimately a positive outcome for Libya is not just up to the international community - this process needs to be led by the Libyan people," he added.  The US National Security Council spokesman added: "With respect to Libya, the president has long said that all of us - including the United States - could have done more in the aftermath of the Libyan intervention."  He said the UK had "stepped up on a range of issues" including meeting the 2% commitment and pressing other Nato members to do the same.  Former Conservative Foreign Secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind said it was "a bit rich" for the US president to single out the UK and France, as they had carried out more air operations in the Libya campaign than any other country.  21 February - David Cameron, on a tour of the Middle East, condemns violence by the Gaddafi regime. Over the next few days he faces criticism over the government's handling of the evacuation of Britons from Libya  28 February: Mr Cameron asks the Ministry of Defence to "work with our allies on plans for a military no-fly zone" over Libya  2 March: Mr Cameron is forced to defend the no-fly zone plan after US Defence Secretary Robert Gates dismisses the idea as "loose talk"  14 March: Mr Cameron insists it is "perfectly deliverable" - and denies he is having trouble convincing other EU leaders, with the exception of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, of the need for one  17 March: The UN Security Council votes to impose a no-fly zone over Libya  19 March: The RAF begins bombing raids alongside French and US jets, with logistical support from several Arab nations  21 March: MPs vote to authorise UK military action, which is backed by then Labour leader Ed Miliband  21 August: Rebel fighters enter Tripoli. Mr Cameron cuts short his summer holiday in Cornwall to hold a meeting of the National Security Council and makes a statement outside Downing Street saying: "Gaddafi must stop fighting - without conditions - and clearly show that he has given up any claim to control Libya."  1 September: Libya's interim rulers meet world leaders in Paris to discuss reshaping Libya, as Gaddafi urges his supporters to fight on  15 September: Speaking in Benghazi's Tahrir square, Mr Cameron praises the way Libya's interim authority has taken charge but warns the "hardest part" is still to come  20 October: Gaddafi is captured and killed by rebel fighters in the city of Sirte	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35773627	Wired explains Trump 'Tiny Hands' misprint	A magazine website that mistakenly replaced Donald Trump's name with the text "Someone With Tiny Hands" has explained how the error occurred.  Wired magazine posted a correction on Wednesday that was widely shared online.  "The name Donald Trump was erroneously replaced with the phrase 'Someone With Tiny Hands' when this story originally published," the statement said.  The publication blamed a joke browser extension for the substitution.  Explaining the mistake, journalist Jason Tanz said a colleague who had installed an anti-Trump browser extension had contributed to his article which resulted in the switch.  Extensions are downloadable add-ons for web browsers that can perform a variety of functions, often adding features or improving productivity.  But joke extensions can also be added which perform specific functions, such as replacing every photo on a website with one of kittens.  "A member of our art team worked on a story of mine while an anti-Trump extension was installed on their browser," said Mr Tanz.  "The result, unbeknownst to us, was that every instance of Trump's name got replaced with the sobriquet 'someone with tiny hands'."  The suggestion that Mr Trump has small hands is often used as an insult by his opponents, including Florida senator Marco Rubio.  Mr Trump has publicly defended the size of his hands, asking a debate audience: "Do these look like small hands?"  Mr Tanz said the browser add-on switched the text, and the submitted story was published because the magazine's editors thought it was an in-joke.  "Our production team thought the phrase was a meta-gag, and let it through," he said.	tech

Quoting banking officials, the agency said the gang behind the raid used stolen credentials to make requests to transfer cash look legitimate.  If all the requests had gone unchallenged, the gang would have got away with about $1bn.  However, the transfers were stopped when the volume of requests raised suspicions at other banks.  The computer hackers behind the breach are believed to have got away with about $80m - one of the largest known bank robberies in history.  To commit the attack, which took place about a month ago, the gang spent time studying the internal processes of Bangladesh's central bank so they could convincingly pose as officials when requesting the transfers.  However, said Reuters, the sheer number of transactions and a spelling mistake helped alert bank staff to the theft.  The spelling mistake in the name of one recipient of funds led Deutsche Bank, which was helping route the cash, to ask for clarification from the central bank, which then stopped the transaction.  Around the same time, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York had alerted the Bangladesh central bank to a series of suspicious requests to transfer money. The requests are believed to have been flagged because they were to private accounts rather than other banks and because there were so many of them.  If all the transfer requests had been fulfilled, the thieves would have got away with about $950m.  The $80m the hackers did steal ended up in accounts in Sri Lanka and the Philippines, said Reuters. The central bank has started proceedings to recover the cash.  Bangladesh's government has publicly blamed the New York Fed for not spotting the suspicious transactions earlier. Earlier this week Bangladesh's Finance Minister Abul Maal Abdul Muhith said it might launch legal action against the US body to help recover the money.  "The Fed must take responsibility," he said.  The New York Fed said its system had not been breached by the hackers and added that it was working with Bangladesh's central bank to investigate what happened.  Security and forensics firm Mandiant is also helping the Bangladeshi investigation into the theft.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35777273	MP Sir Kevin Barron quits standards role over allegations	Labour MP Sir Kevin Barron has stood aside as Commons Standards Committee chairman over allegations he hosted events at Westminster for a drugs firm.  Sir Kevin has referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, Kathryn Hudson.  It follows a Daily Telegraph report saying he received fees for sponsoring dinners and a breakfast on the Parliamentary estate.  In a letter to Ms Hudson, he said all the fees were paid to charity.  According to the Commons Code of Conduct, MPs' use of public resources should always be "in support of their parliamentary duties" and should not "confer any undue personal or financial benefit on themselves or anyone else, or confer undue advantage on a political organisation".  in his letter to Ms Hudson, Sir Kevin wrote: "My own understanding is that due to the fact that I made no personal gain and all the fees were paid to a charity, I had not breached the rules on usage of parliamentary facilities for personal or business use.  "It is a matter of record that I followed the rules in registering this interest and that I deposited an agreement for the provision of services, as the rules required.  "In light of the allegations that I may have breached House of Commons code of conduct or rules, I refer myself to you for you to consider whether any breaches of the rules or the code of conduct have taken place."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35772202	MP David Lammy apologises over nuisance calls	Labour MP David Lammy has apologised "unreservedly" after being fined £5,000 for instigating nuisance calls urging people to back his London mayoral bid.  The 35,629 calls played a recorded message urging support for his failed campaign to be Labour's candidate.  Information Commissioner Christopher Graham said the same rules apply to canvassing for votes as apply "to offering a discount on double glazing".  People getting Mr Lammy's calls had not given permission to receive them.  This meant, according to the Information Commissioner's Office investigation, Mr Lammy had broken the rules set out in the Privacy and Electronic Communication Regulations.  Mr Graham said: "If you want to call someone in this way, you must follow these rules. Mr Lammy did not, and that is why he has been fined.  "It's not good enough to assume the people you're contacting probably won't mind. The law requires you to have permission before making calls with recorded messages. And if the law isn't followed, the regulator will act."  The calls were made in August 2015 using contact details of party members provided by the Labour Party. Mr Lammy did not make the additional checks necessary to ensure he was able to contact the people with recorded messages, the watchdog said.  Mr Graham said: "Mr Lammy's team should have known there were special controls in place around calls with recorded messages. Not only have we published detailed guidance on political campaigning on our website, but we have contacted political parties directly to remind them of the rules."  Mr Lammy came fourth in the contest last year to become Labour's candidate in the forthcoming London mayoral elections with 9.4% of first preferences.  He said: "I fully accept the Information Commissioner's decision and apologise unreservedly to any Labour Party member or registered supporter that felt upset at receiving an automated call from my campaign.  "If I had known that additional permission was required to make automated calls then I would have sought it before any calls were made."	politics

The app can transform faces - often in a cartoon-like fashion - and overlay make-up, animal features or accessories on live video.  Masquerade's filters have been compared to those in rival Snapchat, which Facebook tried to buy in 2013.  One expert said Facebook was responding to competition from Snapchat, which streams millions of videos daily.  The face-swap filter, which switches two people's faces with often alarming results, has become a particular favourite on social media.  "I think Facebook has realised Snapchat has something it doesn't," said David Wilkinson, managing partner at digital consultancy Soho Strategy.  "A lot of people share filtered selfie videos, so I think we can expect to see this integrated into Facebook's Messenger platform.  "Snapchat has its own USP as an ephemeral messaging platform, but for the novelty factor people might just use Facebook's built-in filters."  In 2013, Facebook tried to take over Snapchat for $3bn, but the instant messaging firm rejected the offer, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Facebook has not disclosed how much it has paid for Belarus-based Masquerade, but said it would keep the app running as a standalone program, as well as integrating features with its social network.  "Masquerade has great technology to help us bring even more creative tools to Facebook, and help extend this work to video," the company said in a statement.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768969	Revolutionary socialist Gerry Downing to appeal against Labour expulsion	Gerry Downing, a revolutionary socialist expelled by Labour after criticism of his views on 9/11, has said he will appeal against the move.  David Cameron called on Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to expel him from the party at Prime Minister's Questions.  Labour's ruling NEC later said it had excluded him after "further evidence" had come to light about him.  Mr Downing said his views on 9/11 and so-called Islamic State had been quoted out of context.  In the Commons on Wednesday, David Cameron quoted a blog by Mr Downing, which said the 9/11 hijackers "must never be condemned".  Mr Downing insisted he had been explaining the motivation of the 9/11 attackers, "not agreeing with what they were doing", adding: "I don't support the politics of Isis, they are vile barbarians. But I don't support American imperialist bombing either."  Mr Downing, a former bus driver and member of the tiny Socialist Fight group, told the Daily Politics: "The ambition to overthrow capitalism is a very legitimate political ambition."  He was expelled by the Labour Party last August over views expressed on his Twitter feed and blog but was re-instated in November after an appeal.  Mr Downing said he "had been" a Labour member until Wednesday night, "but nobody bothered to inform" him that he'd been excluded.  He told the Daily Politics the party "should be welcoming" to people with his views and he planned to seek re-admittance.  "If it allows UKIP councillors who defect and it allows people from the far right, and people of that nature, I cannot see why it should not allow in people like me."  Asked by presenter Andrew Neil whether he would condemn the 9/11 attackers, Mr Downing said he wouldn't use the word "condemn", saying he would seek to "understand the motivation of the people that did that."  Mr Downing said his group does not support so-called Islamic State "militarily or politically" but he does believe in providing "tactical" support, which he explained as being against US bombing.  He said he was not a "personal friend" of John McDonnell but said the shadow chancellor had "secured some justice for me" in a work dispute, after the two men met on the Labour Representation Committee.  Times journalist Philip Collins, a former speech writer to Tony Blair, said he was "delighted" Mr Downing had been expelled, telling him there was "no place in the Labour Party for your views".  In an open letter to Mr Corbyn, before Mr Downing's latest expulsion, Labour MP John Woodcock, a longstanding critic of the Labour leader, said his group's views were "sickening and bring our party into disrepute".  In a statement of its aims on its website, Socialist Fight says: "We defend the 'Islamic State' in Syria and Iraq against the bombing of US imperialism but do not ally with them against the Kurdish defenders of Kobane and Rojava (Western Kurdistan)."  The post goes on to explain its stance in some detail. saying, among things, that "the Islamic State is a reactionary utopia and has no legitimate right to self-determination".	politics

The five-game contest is being seen as a major test of what scientists and engineers have achieved in the sphere of AI.  After the match, Lee Se-dol said: "Yesterday I was surprised but today it's more than that, I am quite speechless.  "Today I feel like AlphaGo played a nearly perfect game," he said.  "If you look at how the game was played I admit it was a clear loss on my part."  Lee Se-dol is considered a champion Go player, winning numerous tournaments over a long, successful career.  In October 2015, AlphaGo beat the European Go champion, an achievement that was not expected for years.  A computer beat the world's chess champion in 1997, but Go is recognised as a more complex board game.  On Thursday, the Korea Times reported that locals had started calling AlphaGo "AI sabum" - or "master AI".  Three games remain, but Google only has to win once more to named the victor.  "Playing against a machine is very different from an actual human opponent," world champion Lee Se-dol told the BBC ahead of the first match.  "Normally, you can sense your opponent's breathing, their energy. And lots of times you make decisions which are dependent on the physical reactions of the person you're playing against.  "With a machine, you can't do that."  Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess.  There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.  Google's AlphaGo was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.  The computer program first studied common patterns that are repeated in past games, Demis Hassabis, DeepMind chief executive explained to the BBC.  "After it's learned that, it's got to reasonable standards by looking at professional games. It then played itself, different versions of itself millions and millions of times and each time get incrementally slightly better - it learns from its mistakes"  Learning and improving from its own matchplay experience means the super computer is now even stronger than when it beat the European champion late last year.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35773058	Spike in ransomware spam prompts warnings	Security firms are warning about a sudden "huge" surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware.  The surge is being blamed on the group behind a novel strain of ransomware called Locky.  One security firm reported that a version of Locky produced two weeks ago is now the second most prevalent form of ransomware it sees.  The US, France and Japan were the top targets for the gang behind Locky, statistics suggested.  Like many other ransomware programs, Locky encrypts data on an infected machine and then asks for a payment before providing a decryption key. Currently Locky asks for 3 bitcoins (£885) as payment.  The first versions of Locky hid the malicious attachment that did the encrypting in add-ons or macros for Microsoft Word. Now, say security firms, its creators have switched to using attachments written in Javascript.  "We are currently seeing extraordinary (sic) huge volumes of Javascript attachments being spammed out," said Rodel Mendrez, a security expert at Trustwave in a blogpost.  The switch to Javascript has helped Locky avoid being spotted by anti-virus software, said Trustwave.  At peak spamming times, wrote Mr Mendrez, about 200,000 messages an hour carrying ransomware attachments were hitting its junk mail spotting servers.  Security firm Fortinet said it had caught almost 19 million copies of ransomware emails over the last two weeks. The latest version of Locky using the Javascript attachment accounted for 16.5% of this total, said Roland Dela Paz in a blogpost.  The most prevalent ransomware family in that total was Cryptowall which was found in 83.5% of the ransomware emails it had caught. Cryptowall first appeared in early 2014.  The spam surge had helped establish Locky as a "significant presence" in the ransomware world, said Mr Dela Paz.  The attackers sending out large amounts of Locky spam were using the same network of hijacked computers, known as a botnet, that was used to distribute the Dridex banking trojan.  "It's the same botnet, different day, and different payload," said Mr Mendrez.  To avoid falling victim, people and companies should regularly back up data so it can be restored if a machine gets infected, he said.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35774687	Rocky road ahead	It's one of the biggest and most significant bills of this Parliament - and it could prove to be very vulnerable to a dangerous combination of Tory dissidents and Opposition parties.  The Investigatory Powers Bill - the new "Snoopers' Charter" to its critics - is the latest attempt to create a legal framework for an armoury of internet surveillance powers, which the government believes are critical to the fight against terrorism, organised crime and online paedophilia.  But because it has to be through Parliament before the end of December, its opponents have a great deal of leverage against it.  The reasons lie in the long backstory behind this latest bill; first, there was the Communications Data Bill, which was dropped by the coalition, after a savaging from a joint committee of MPs and peers.  Then there was the compromise measure DRIPA, the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, which only got through Parliament after a "sunset clause" was added, under which many of the powers it granted would expire at the end of the year.  Which explains the urgency around the Investigatory Powers Act, because a new law has to be in place, to ensure current powers don't lapse after that December deadline.  The bill would provide an armoury of new powers - as the Home Secretary, Theresa May, told Parliament, it would give powers to "law enforcement, the security and intelligence agencies and the armed forces to acquire the content of communications or communications data. These include the ability to retain and acquire communications data to be used as evidence in court and to advance investigations; the ability to intercept the contents of communications in order to acquire sensitive intelligence to tackle terrorist plots and serious and organised crimes; the use of equipment interference powers to obtain data covertly from computers; and the use of these powers by the security and intelligence agencies in bulk to identify the most serious threats to the UK from overseas and to rapidly establish links between suspects in the UK."  To many civil libertarians the proposed powers are unacceptably intrusive, and at the very least extremely powerful safeguards need to be in place around them - the government is offering a "double lock" requiring both the home secretary and a judge to sign off on interception warrants.  This is the kind of issue which could unite Labour (mostly, anyway; there are senior figures with worried about appearing soft on terror), the SNP and the Lib Dems, as well as the modest group of Tory critics around uber-awkward squaddie, David Davis.  We will get an early indication of how co-ordinated these groups are, and how hard they intend to fight on Tuesday at the second reading debate.  There are unlikely to be actual votes against the bill, because no-one wants to be accused of being soft on crime and terrorism, but there could well be abstentions, and some parties could even whip their MPs to abstain.  And there may also be a bit of action around the programme motion; so big and so significant is this bill, that there are calls for it to be given an unusually long report stage, to allow MPs to propose detailed changes. There is already talk of a two-day report stage; some critics argue for four, and their demands could well be put to a vote.  The real moment of Commons danger will probably come during that report stage (however many days are devoted to it) when cross-party amendments are likely on a range of issues. Again, these are likely to be presented in terms of what is most effective in fighting terrorism and organised crime; there is an argument, for example, that bulk data collection powers result in the security services or the police trying to find a needle in a much larger haystack.  It is probably too early to identify exactly what issues will be pushed - but this is one of those rare measures which might bring together a Commons majority against the government. And it will test the powers of the ministerial team behind the bill - John Hayes, the Security Minister, and Robert Buckland, the Solicitor-General, as well as of the government whips.  A crucial factor in all this is the slightly unlikely, but very real alliance, between Labour's Deputy Leader, Tom Watson, and David Davis, which combines two hardened Commons street-fighters. In fact they may get in an early blow, if they succeed in challenging some of the data retention powers in the European Court. A ruling in their favour there could gut a major part of this bill.  And all this is before the bill arrives in the House of Lords, where, of course, the government does not have even a theoretical majority. And the problem for ministers there is that if the bill is to become law by that December deadline, there simply is not the time to override unwelcome Lords amendments by means of the Parliament Act, which gives peers considerable leverage to force the government to compromise.  One possible deal would be to pass a mini-bill simply extending the existing DRIPA powers, while allowing much longer for Parliament to ponder the rest of the Investigatory Powers Bill.  But the Security Minister, John Hayes, told me on Radio 4's Today in Parliament, last week, that that would be a "soft option" and noted that there had been extensive consideration of the bill in draft, by three different select committees, so the issues were hardly new to MPs or peers. But he's clearly braced for a rough few months.	politics

The Barnsley Central MP argued in a speech that Labour did not do enough when it was in power to tackle inequality and fears about immigration.  He took a swipe at New Labour - saying it was not "radical" enough - and distanced himself from Ed Miliband, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown.  He said disadvantaged people wanted a party that "beats the government".  Delivering his second wide-ranging speech in a week, Mr Jarvis told an audience at think-tank Demos: "Let's be frank - New Labour's approach wasn't enough. It didn't get at the root causes.  "New Labour didn't see with sufficient clarity the downsides of globalisation. They knew it meant cheap consumer goods. But they didn't recognise that too often it meant cheap labour too."  However, he urged the party not to abandon its record in government altogether.  "It's a false choice to say we must either champion Labour's record in government or denounce it. The truth is we should defend our achievements and learn from our mistakes. To anyone outside Westminster, that's common sense," he said.  Mr Jarvis, a former member of the Parachute regiment who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, entered Parliament in a by-election in 2011.  He resisted calls to stand in last year's Labour leadership contest, saying he needed to put his young family first (he had recently remarried after losing his first wife to cancer), but later said he regretted not thinking about a bid more.  He is regularly touted as a potential challenger to Jeremy Corbyn - if there is an attempt by the "moderate" wing of the party to oust the Labour leader.  In his speech, he said people left powerless by the actions of the Conservatives "want to vote for a party that doesn't just oppose the government, they want a party that beats the government".  He argued that the next Labour government "must take a more radical economic approach - more radical than we had under Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband".  He added: "Put simply, Labour needs to be tough on inequality, tough on the causes of inequality."  And in a swipe at Mr Miliband's general election campaign, he said: "Even when people knew what our policies were they did not trust us to deliver them.  "We were talking a language from another planet."  He stressed the need to invest more in research and development, take a more long-term approach to the economy and encourage unions to "provide education and training to adults wishing to learn new skills".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35773619	Android N brings split-screen multitasking apps	Split-screen multitasking and improved notification controls are among the new features being added to the Android operating system (OS).  An early build of the new OS, known as Android N, was released on Thursday for app developers to test.  Google said it had released the beta software earlier than usual so that device manufacturers could get the finished version sooner.  At the moment, fewer than 3% of Android phones run the latest OS, Marshmallow.  Typically, Google discusses the next generation of its Android OS at its annual developer conference in the summer.  But this year it has released a first draft earlier than expected.  "By releasing the first preview and asking for your feedback now (in March!), we'll be able to act on that feedback while still being able to hand off the final N release to device makers this summer," wrote Hiroshi Lockheimer, senior vice president of Android, in a blog post.  On Monday, Google published statistics that showed an older version of Android, Lollipop, was still more widely used than the latest variant.  About 36% of Android devices run Lollipop, with fewer than 3% running the newer Marshmallow.  But a range of new smartphones running Marshmallow, from manufacturers such as Samsung and LG, are due to be released.  Android N will introduce split-screen multitasking that allows people to use two apps at the same time.  Information can be copied across from one app to the other.  A similar feature is already available on some iOS and Windows 10 devices, and Samsung has already added the feature to some of its Android smartphones.  The new software also introduces some cosmetic changes to settings and notifications, and aims to improve battery life.  Google has traditionally named new versions of the operating system after sweet treats, as was the case with Lollipop and Marshmallow.  The newest version has not yet been named but it has been suggested that Android N will be named after a popular chocolate and hazelnut breakfast spread.  "We're nut tellin' you yet," said Mr Lockheimer, possibly hinting at the name.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35768674	Sunday trading defeat for government as MPs reject changes	Plans to overhaul Sunday trading laws in England and Wales have been dropped after they were rejected by MPs.  The Commons opposed proposals to allow councils to extend opening hours by 317 votes to 286, as 27 Tories rebelled.  Ministers had sought to limit the rebellion by promising to trial the changes in 12 areas but said afterwards they would respect MPs' views.  Critics of the plans said they would "chip away" at Sunday's special status and put undue pressure on workers.  It is the Conservative government's second defeat in the House of Commons since it was elected last May.  The government had hoped to relax existing restrictions on Sunday trading, which limit large shops to opening for a maximum of six hours, by devolving responsibility to local councils. But their plans were thwarted by an unlikely alliance of Labour, the SNP and Conservative backbenchers.  List of Conservative MPs who voted against the government  Before the vote, ministers indicated they would seek to amend their proposals in the House of Lords if MPs approved them in principle. But while blaming the SNP for the defeat, ministers conceded afterwards the plans would not be resurrected.  "We respect the view of the House of Parliament. The Commons has spoken and given a very clear view - we have to absolutely respect that," said the planning minister Brandon Lewis.  In the biggest proposed shake-up for 20 years, ministers wanted to give the 353 councils in England and 22 in Wales the freedom to determine opening hours for large shops in their area.  During a three-hour debate, a succession of Conservative MPs spoke out against the changes - first announced by Mr Osborne in last year's Budget - and the way they were being introduced.  The reason the government lost by such a margin was not just because of staunch opposition from the Labour Party with its 'Keep Sunday Special' campaign, or the principled opposition from many Tory MPs who believe fervently that Sundays are indeed special and should be protected.  The government also lost because the SNP objected to their plans, even though in Scotland shops have opened for longer on Sundays for many years.  It is an embarrassing defeat for the government and particularly George Osborne, who must deliver the Budget a week today. But the SNP's involvement could have a longer term impact. Read more from Laura  Sir Gerald Howarth said the late offer of concessions had been "shambolic" and looked like they had been "delivered by lastminute.com" while Stewart Jackson said the "dead hand" of the Treasury was responsible for an "egregious and unnecessary confrontation" with Tory backbenchers.  Conservative MP David Burrowes, who tabled the successful rebel amendment, said the government had not made the economic case for such sweeping changes, which he said were opposed by businesses of all sizes, shop workers and faith groups.  Speaking after the vote, he told BBC News of his "relief", adding: "The main thing out there is relief for shop workers, families and businesses who will really be pleased today."  Labour said the government's approach had been "tawdry" and the House of Commons had spoken clearly on the "contentious issue".  The Federation of Small Businesses said the outcome was a "major win" for its members.  "Our members have been unconvinced of the economic case for relaxing Sunday trading rules and there has been no impact assessment to support the proposals," said the group's policy director, Mike Cherry.  "The current system can be seen as a great British compromise which allows families to spend time together, employees to work if they wish to, and provides much needed support for smaller retailers within their communities."  The proposed changes were not covered by new English Votes for English Laws provisions, which require the explicit consent of English and Welsh MPs for measures exclusively affecting them, because other parts of the Enterprise Bill apply to Scotland.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35767948	Government suffers two defeats in Lords on Immigration Bill	The government has twice been defeated in the Lords over its Immigration Bill, shortly after losing a vote in the Commons on Sunday trading.  Peers voted to allow asylum seekers the right to work if their claims have not been processed within six months.  They also voted to allow overseas domestic workers to change employers without risking immediate deportation.  Opponents had argued the latter provision would create "a wide open door to the UK" that could be abused.  Peers voted by 280 votes to 195 in favour of a Labour, Lib Dem and crossbench amendment to the Immigration Bill on the rights of asylum seekers to work.  Lord Alton of Liverpool, who proposed it, said it would end the "enforced workhouse destitution" currently experienced by asylum seekers.  "They are frustrated at being forced to remain idle and survive on benefits," he said.  "How many of us could exist on just over £5 a day while an asylum application was being considered? This is way below the poverty line. Where is the justice and fairness in that?"  At present, asylum seekers are not allowed to work unless they have been waiting for a decision on their case for more than a year - and then only in national shortage occupations.  Lord Alton said 3,500 people had been waiting for six months or more by the end of last year, and they deserved to be able to work rather than "eke out" an existence on "pitiful" state benefits.  He insisted "all the available evidence shows that permission to work does not act as a pull factor for asylum seekers, or migrants."  Arguing against the amendment, crossbench peer Lord Green of Deddington warned reducing the time limit could encourage asylum seekers to "spin out" their cases with appeals.  "Not all people seeking asylum are genuine. The record is that 50% turn out not to be. We should be seeking to reduce pull factors, not increase them," he said.  For the government, Home Office minister Lord Bates said the example of Sweden - where asylum seekers can work as soon as they arrive - showed that greater employment rights "might act as a pull factor".  "We should not be doing anything to encourage more people to risk their lives. Now is not the time to make this change," the minister argued.  The second defeat will give domestic workers the right to change their employer once in the UK and to remain in the country for up to two years after doing so.  At present, changing employers is not allowed, but those in favour of the amendment argued that rule often traps individuals in an abusive workplace, as they fear they will be ordered out of the country if they try to leave.  "The scandal of abuse and exploitation has gone on for too long, sometimes in the most affluent parts of London," crossbencher Lord Hylton said.  Opposing the change, Lord Green said it would mean someone could leave their employer whether they were being ill-treated or not, adding: "It provides what will be seen by many as a wide open door to the UK."  Lord Bates said the government was committed to eradicating modern-day slavery and abuse, but argued the amendment could be open to manipulation by people who had not been placed in difficult situations.  Despite those objections, the amendment was supported by 226 votes to 198.	politics

The firm said a fibre-optic cable had been cut and could not say when it would be fixed.  An EE spokeswoman said a small proportion of the 30 million users of its network had been affected.  Some customers expressed dissatisfaction at what they said was a lack of communication from the firm.  One BBC viewer complained that EE had not posted an explanation on its website. John Edwards said he and his wife were worried that they would miss an event because they could not print tickets held in their inbox.  "You have got holiday tickets, train tickets, theatre tickets, tennis tickets - you name it. The system today with a lot of these suppliers is to do it by email. People cannot get their tickets," he told the BBC.  EE has engaged with some affected users on Twitter and posted a statement on the website-monitoring service Down Detector.  "A lot of people are complaining bitterly about the lack of information or the fact that the system has crashed.  "Why do they not make a public announcement and be quite open about [it]?" asked Mr Edwards. "That could be done through Twitter but I am not a Twitter user, I am not a Facebook user."  EE also fielded complaints from customers on Twitter.  In its statement to customers, EE said: "We have now identified a technical problem with a third-party fibre-optic cable that leads into one of our major data-centres.  "We understand the cable has been cut and we're in the process of replacing it. Needless to say we have a number of teams working to fix it as soon as possible.  "We are really sorry and know how frustrating outages such as this can be. We'll let you know as soon as the fix is in place."  A spokeswoman added that only those customers trying to access their email through a web browser, rather than through an app, were affected.  She could not say how many users had been affected, but said she believed it to be small proportion of EE's total customer-base.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35766069	Headphones use ear canals to carry out ID checks	NEC has announced that it is developing earbuds that can confirm an owner's identity.  The Japanese firm says the technology works by playing a sound and then checking how it resonates in the wearer's ear canal.  This provides a biometric check that serves as an alternative to a fingerprint sensor or eye scanner.  NEC said it intended to make products using the facility available before the end of 2018.  One expert praised the innovation for offering a fresh alternative to passcodes - which can be spied on and stolen - but warned that the innovation could be turned against its user.  NEC said its earbuds could be used to complete an ID test in about one second.  The earphones need to be fitted with a microphone, it explained, in order to record the waveforms generated by a short burst of audio noise as it was reflected around the eardrum.  Since the shape and size of each person's ears are unique, the firm said, the resulting data could be used to distinguish an individual.  "It enables a natural way of conducting continuous authentication, even during movement and while performing work, simply by wearing an earphone with a built-in microphone to listen to the sounds within ears," said NEC manager Shigeki Yamagata.  The firm added that it believed its technique would act as a reliable check more than 99% of the time.  The German security firm SRLabs was among the first to demonstrate that fingerprint sensors can be spoofed, and the organisation has long warned that the danger with using any biometric marker is that once an identifier has been copied you cannot reset it like a password.  The problem was recently highlighted when it emerged a US government database containing millions of people's fingerprint records had been hacked.  One of SRLabs' researchers also highlighted another problem: it is potentially easier for the authorities to force someone to comply with a fingerprint or ear canal check than it is to make them reveal their password.  "I bet the FBI is regretting the fact that [San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook] hadn't been using an iPhone with a fingerprint sensor as they could have forced his dead body to have unlocked the handset for them rather than trying to make the courts get Apple to help," said Ben Schlabs.  Technology consultant Ben Wood suggested earbud-based checks might also prove less convenient than using sensors built into a mobile phone.  "People always have their handsets with them - that's not the case for their earphones," he said.  "But they do make sense as a way to provide authentication if you are already on a call while using them."  He added that the two techniques could also be combined.  "Two-factor authentication is becoming a bigger deal as we move away from traditional passwords, so using both a fingerprint and an earprint, if that's what it's called, could be useful to those who want a higher level of security."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35759590	Government facing battle in Sunday trading vote	The government faces possible defeat on plans that could extend Sunday trading hours in England and Wales.  MPs will vote later on handing control of the issue to local councils - which unions and Labour say could extend Sunday opening by up to six hours.  More than 20 Tory MPs are expected to rebel, one saying the shake-up would "chip away" at Sunday's special status.  Ministers have offered concessions, including piloting the changes and an annual review, if MPs agree to them.  If the SNP bands together with Labour and the 20 or more Conservatives backbenchers opposed to the plans it could defeat the government in the Commons vote - expected at around 18:00 GMT.  The SNP had considered abstaining in the vote, as there are no Sunday trading restrictions in Scotland, but now plans to vote against. It claims the plans could hit shop workers' pay in Scotland - a position described as "extraordinary" and "hypocritical" by the government.  In the hope of averting a possible defeat, the government has offered to trial the changes in 12 areas. It says their impact on communities and workers will then be evaluated after a year before MPs decide whether to extend them throughout England and Wales.  An amendment to the Enterprise Bill promising this was not selected for debate by the Commons Speaker, who told MPs that it had been submitted too late, but ministers have said they will table it in the House of Lords in the coming weeks.  Conservative MP for Enfield Southgate, David Burrowes, who is among those planning to vote against the changes, said he was sorry that it had come to this, given that the PM had ruled out changes to existing Sunday laws during the general election campaign.  He said Sunday trading hours were "an issue of conscience" and challenged the need for the shake-up, saying retailers believed "sorting out parking and business rates" was more important for regenerating High Streets.  "Why are we trying to unpick something which is fairly settled?" he said. "There are complex arrangements about Sunday trading and it is a duty on us to look at it carefully, consult on it widely and to scrutinise it fairly. None of those things have happened."  For Labour, shadow business minister Bill Esterson said the government had not made the case for changing the law, and that allowing stores in some areas to open for longer would lead to a "domino effect" elsewhere.  And the SDLP's Mark Durkan said the government's "artist's impression of a flat pack compromise" should not be taken seriously.  However, Conservative MP for Newark, Robert Jenrick, said the public should be trusted to vote with their feet.  "It isn't actually the most complicated decision constituents will make in their lives," he said. "Shouldn't we trust our constituents to make wise decisions for them and their families?"  Planning minister Brandon Lewis said it was "not forcing anyone to shop on a Sunday" but the existing laws were devised "before anyone had heard of Amazon" and he defended the government's right to modernise them.  "Our election manifesto was clear we wanted to see economic growth and the prime minister was very clear at this dispatch box last year that we feel it it is time to review Sunday trading laws in light of how things have moved on," he said.  The BBC's Nick Eardley on the situation in Scotland  There are no specific restrictions in Scotland on when big shops can open - though in some religious communities they don't open on a Sunday.  Historically, many staff have been able to negotiate higher rates of pay for working on Sunday. Not everyone is entitled to this - many younger workers don't get any extra - but the STUC estimates that for a third of retail workers, the premium is worth £1,400.  The SNP says it is concerned those premiums would be eroded if the whole of the UK moves to unrestricted Sunday trading.  But their opponents accuse them of hypocrisy, saying shoppers in England and Wales should be given the same freedom as those in Scotland.  The SNP said some Scottish workers were paid extra for working on Sundays and there were no guarantees these "premium pay" rates, worth thousands of pounds a year, would be protected if hours were extended in other parts of the UK.  "We are relying on guarantees or not from private businesses and that simply doesn't wash when we are talking about the incomes of perhaps a third of retail employees in Scotland," its deputy leader Stewart Hosie said.  The Lib Dems have been given a free vote - with their eight MPs expected to be split 50/50 on the issue.  BBC deputy political editor James Landale said Sunday trading had long been a "toxic" issue for the Conservatives, causing a rare Commons defeat for Margaret Thatcher in 1986, when 72 Tory MPs rebelled against plans to relax restrictions. Read more from James.  Since 1994, small shops - those up to 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft in size - in England and Wales can open when they want to on Sundays but larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.  Ministers want to give the 353 councils in England and 22 in Wales the freedom to determine opening hours in their area.  More than 100 Tory councillors voiced their support for the move urging the government to "help us deliver what is best for our local communities".  But critics argue that family time and other pursuits, including Church going and other forms of religious observance, should be prioritised.  A group of faith leaders, including the Bishop of St Albans, the Archbishop of Wales and the President of the Methodist Conference, have warned the changes will "disrupt the rhythms of community life that are so integral to the common good".	politics

The Sun quotes anonymous sources, one of whom claims to have witnessed a "bust-up" between the Queen and pro-EU former Deputy PM Nick Clegg in 2011.  The palace insisted the Queen was "politically neutral" while Mr Clegg called the story "nonsense".  But the Sun said it stood by its story and would defend itself "vigorously".  All you need to know about the EU referendum  UK and the EU - better off out or in?  Under the headline, "Queen backs Brexit", the Sun said the Queen's exchange with Mr Clegg at a lunch in 2011 left "no room for doubt about her passionate feelings over Europe".  It said her "reprimand" of Mr Clegg "went on for some time and stunned other guests".  The paper says the Queen also revealed her feelings about Europe during a separate conversation with MPs at Buckingham Palace "a few years ago".  It claims the Queen told them: "I don't understand Europe" - words an unnamed parliamentary source says she spoke with "venom and emotion".  Following the complaint the newspaper said: "The Sun stands by its story, which was based upon two impeccable sources and presented in a robust, accessible fashion.  "The Sun will defend this complaint vigorously."  It is unusual for the Queen to take action against a newspaper.  It is a sign of the depth of regal displeasure.  It is the Sun headline, "Queen Backs Brexit" which is both toxic and very troubling to an institution which prides itself on remaining above the political fray.  But the course of action the palace has now embarked upon brings with it risks. It's a far cry from the "never complain, never explain" mantra once deployed by officials in the past.  The letter to the press watchdog ensures that the Sun story continues to be debated.  And there continues to be a focus on what the Queen chose very deliberately to do four days before the Scottish referendum.  When she told a well-wisher in 2014 "I hope people will think very carefully about the future", it was interpreted as support for Scotland remaining within the UK.  It was a planned remark the Queen and her senior advisers may come to regret.  A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "We can confirm that we have this morning written to the chairman of the Independent Press Standards Organisation to register a complaint about the front page story in today's Sun newspaper.  "The complaint relates to Clause One of the Editors' Code of Practice."  The Editors' Code of Practice is regulated by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO). Clause One refers to accuracy, saying "the Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text".  It also states "while free to editorialise and campaign, the Press must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact".  The Sun's political editor Tom Newton Dunn wrote that the paper would not have reported the Queen's remarks "had they not come from two different and impeccably placed sources".  He says the Queen must remain "above the fray" of political issues, but added: "If she has a view on Brexit, don't voters have a right to know what it is?"  Professor Vernon Bogdanor, constitutional expert at Kings College London, told the Press Association it was "absurd" that the Queen would break from her tradition of political impartiality after decades as monarch.  "I'm very dubious. The Queen speaks and acts on the advice of ministers," Prof Bogdanor said. "What she said on the Scottish referendum was that people should think carefully before they vote - and that's a very sensible comment, I would have thought."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35763917	Toshiba's robot is designed to be more human-like	Toshiba has shown off the latest generation of its Chihira robot at a trade fair in Berlin.  The machine - which is designed to look as human-like as possible - has had the German language added to its repertoire.  The firm also told the BBC that it upgraded the machine's control system to make its movements smoother.  However, one expert suggested the realistic appearance might not be best suited to Western audiences.  Prof Noel Sharkey - a roboticist at the University of Sheffield - said he thought the machine still fell "clearly on this side of the uncanny valley".  The term refers to the fact that many people feel increasingly uncomfortable the closer a robot gets to appearing like a human being, so long as the two remain distinguishable.  Toshiba brought the Chihira Kanae droid to the ITB travel expo to highlight what it hopes could become a viable product for the tourism industry.  The machine has been installed at an information desk where it responds to attendees' verbal questions about the conference.  It marks the first appearance of the robot outside Japan, where it was unveiled last month.  The earlier models in the series are:  "We have improved the software and the hardware to [improve] the air pressure system," explained Hitoshi Tokuda, chief specialist at Toshiba's research and development centre.  "If the air pressure is unstable, her movements become affected by vibrations. So, if the air flow is very precisely controlled, her movements are smoother."  Like its predecessors, Chihira Kanae can also interpret and respond to requests in English, Japanese and Chinese, as well as using sign language.  "It can be combined with any kind of language processing system, so we can make her speak many other languages as well," added Mr Tokuda.  "We have created Chihira Kanae to have a human-like appearance as people, particularly the older generation, find this look more welcoming and approachable.  "This is particularly important as, in addition to her work in the tourism and service industries, Chirhira Kanae will be used in the health sector to care for older people.  "We have also found that people prefer speaking to a human-like communication android as they can ask their questions as many times as they need, without feeling embarrassed or awkward."  However, Prof Sharkey is not convinced by Toshiba's approach.  "As a robot, it is very good but it still has that slight look of a psycho killer," he commented.  He added that there was a growing cultural split in opinions about what androids should look like.  "In surveys between Japan and the US, it seems that the Japanese really want robots that are indistinguishable from humans, while in the US and the West in general, people would rather know it's a robot that they are dealing with.  "Personally, I would always prefer to know that I am dealing with a robot rather than being deceived by a machine. It is a matter of trust."  A contrast to Toshiba's approach is a new collaboration between IBM and Hilton Hotels & Resorts.  They are using a robot to provide guests at one of Hilton's Virginia properties with information about local attractions.  The machine uses IBM's Watson artificial intelligence software to make its recommendations.  The companies selected Nao - a squat, plastic-looking android made by Japan's Softbank - to deliver the information.	tech

Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, he said to MPs "we have all been guilty" of leading campaigns against them in the past.  But he said the focus should be on "ensuring everyone is connected to the information super highway".  His comments prompted speculation a law change could be in next week's Budget.  The issue was raised by Conservative MP Andrew Murrison, who said the UK's superfast broadband connectivity was "relatively poor" and businesses in rural areas, in particular, were losing out from patchy coverage.  The PM said the number of homes able to access superfast broadband - defined as providing download speeds in excess of 24 Mbps - had doubled since 2010. But he said more needed to be done, suggesting objections to new masts motivated by so-called Nimbyism had to stop.  "I think this is something for members right across the House. Ten years ago we were all rather guilty of leading campaigns against masts and the rest of it," he said.  "Our constituents now want coverage for the internet, they want coverage for mobile phones.  "We need to make sure we change the law in all the ways necessary to make sure... the masts are built, we increase coverage and we ensure everyone is connected to the information superhighway."  The government says it is on track to meet its goals of providing superfast broadband coverage to 90% of the UK by early 2016 and 95% by December 2017 although critics have accused ministers of moving the targets to guarantee compliance.	politics

"Let us end the process of having people with bigoted religious views treating women as second class citizens," he told Labour MPs  "I think you should all take the pledge - no more segregated meetings," he added.  It follows reports of Labour meetings where Asian men and women have been separated along gender lines.  A Labour Party spokesperson said: "David Cameron is trying to imply that the Labour Party condones segregation.  "This is absolutely untrue. We make sure that everyone is treated equally and respectfully and our record on gender equality speaks for itself."  In May last year, Labour's then deputy leader Harriet Harman told LBC radio she did not "agree" with a Labour rally she had attended in Birmingham where Asian men and women were seated on different sides of the room.  She said it would have better if the meeting had decided to "sit round in a big circle" but she did not "like to be rude" by walking out.  "This meeting was organised by a male Labour councillor and a female Labour councillor, and what they were trying to do is ensure there weren't men-only meetings, which we are even more not in favour of it," she told LBC.  "It was actually bringing the women from the community into the meeting."  At the time the Labour Party said: "There was no forced segregation. Speakers at the event included both women and men."  Labour's current deputy leader Tom Watson, Ms Harman's husband, Labour MP Jack Dromey, and Birmingham MPs Liam Byrne and Khalid Mahmood were also reported to be at the meeting.	politics

The Labour leader said that on his 99 previous questions he has been "unclear or dissatisfied with the answer".  But he pressed on with a crowd sourced inquiry from a "Callum" on cuts to the funding of sixth form and further education colleges.  Mr Cameron disputed Mr Corbyn's claims but congratulated him on reaching "100 not out".  The prime minister said that his survival was welcomed across the House of Commons.  Mr Corbyn has attempted to introduce a less confrontational style, and to ask questions sent in by members of the public, since he took over as Labour leader last September.  BBC analysis shows nearly half of Mr Corbyn's questions have been on welfare or health, with none on immigration.  He asked what is believed to be his first question on the economy at Wednesday's session, saying: "The construction output in Britain has shrunk for two consecutive quarters now, surely this is a matter of concern.  "Isn't this really a bit of a sign that this economic recovery is being constructed on sand?"  The PM said the government wanted "to see every part of our economy growing", but he added: "If you look at our construction plans, because we've got a strong economy we're able to commit to HS2, we're able to commit to the biggest road programme since the 1970s, the largest rail programme since Victorian times, together with huge infrastructure projects in energy and in other areas.  "Those things are only possible because we've got a strong and growing economy."  Mr Cameron warned that Labour would "wreck the country's finances" and put up taxes for low and middle earners.  The Labour leader then accused Mr Cameron of holding back Britain by cutting skills training and investment.  Mr Cameron claimed Labour had created instability in the economy while in government and failed to build enough houses - and disputed Mr Corbyn's figures on apprenticeships, which he claimed had seen a big increase in funding.  In a wide-ranging set of questions, Mr Corbyn also highlighted new figures from children's charities showing council spending on children and young people has been cut by £2bn.  The Labour leader said the reductions came at the same time as Mr Osborne cut corporation tax to the lowest level in the G7.  "Doesn't this demonstrate a wrong choice by the prime minister?" Mr Corbyn asked.  Mr Cameron hit back, accusing Mr Corbyn of making a "political point" instead of acknowledging that corporation tax receipts had increased by 20%, giving the Government more money to spend on services.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35764829	Google ordered to release fake reviewers' contact details	Google has been ordered to hand over all contact details linked to accounts behind a series of damaging fake online reviews.  An Amsterdam judge told the tech firm to release internet and email addresses, phone numbers and names related to four reviewers, one of whom assumed the identity of a dead woman.  Google deleted the reviews but the nursery's lawyer said it has not yet handed over the information.  Googe said it was reviewing the decision.  The nursery, which was not named in the judge's ruling, complained that the reviews were making serious and unfounded claims that it was neglecting children, and that this was harming its business.  Three of the reviews were removed by Google for breaching its anti-spam rules after the nursery complained, including one written in the name of a woman who died in the US in November 2006. Others were found to have been copied and pasted from other websites.  In a ruling handed down last week, the judge CM Berkhout ordered the fourth to be removed because it too was in breach of the rules.  Google was given two weeks to hand over the information related to the four accounts - all of which remain active on Google+ - as well as the exact dates and times the reviews were posted. It was also told to pay more than €1,500 (£1,100, $1,600) to the nursery by the same date.  Paul Tjiam of Simmons and Simmons, who represented the nursery, said he believed the case would make it more difficult for fake reviewers to "hide themselves behind their computers." He added that the nursery would contact the people behind the fake reviews before deciding whether or not to pursue civil action against them.  He told the BBC that fake reviews online were not just an issue in the Netherlands, but a "worldwide problem." He said the courts' decision "shows that Google has a long way before its notice-and-take-down policy functions properly." Mr Tjiam said it was "stunning" that Google allowed the reviews to remain online. "Hopefully, another consequence of this decision is that it will make Google rethink their own policies and the way they enforce their policies."  He added: "Google's attorneys informed me that Google is still considering an appeal, but as far as I know they have not made a decision."  A Google spokesman declined to confirm that and said: "We've received the ruling and are currently reviewing it." The BBC understands that this is not the first time Google has removed reviews in the Netherlands, nor is it understood to be the first time it has been ordered to hand over internet protocol information, which identifies computers online.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35761246	Google’s AI beats world Go champion in first of five matches	In a landmark battle between man and artificial intelligence (AI), the world champion of the game Go was narrowly defeated by his computer opponent.  Google's DeepMind AlphaGo program beat South Korea's Lee Se-dol in the first of a series of games in Seoul.  In October 2015, AlphaGo beat the European Go champion, an achievement that was not expected for years.  A computer has beaten the world chess champion, but the Chinese game Go is seen as significantly more complex.  The BBC's Stephen Evans in Seoul said Mr Lee appeared "nervous, sighing and shaking his head" at the outset of the match.  Throughout most of the game he had seemed to have the upper hand but in the last 20 minutes, AlphaGo took an unassailable lead. Mr Lee then forfeited, handing victory to his opponent.  "I was very surprised because I did not think that I would lose the game," said Mr Lee.  "A mistake I made at the very beginning lasted until the very last."  The Go player has won 18 world championships since turning professional at the age of 12.  He said AlphaGo's early strategy was "excellent'' and that he was stunned by one unconventional move it had made that a human never would have played.  Despite his initial loss though, he did not regret accepting the challenge.  "I had a lot of fun playing Go and I'm looking forward to the future games,'' he said.  The two sides will play a total of five games over the coming days for a prize of about $1m (£700,000).  The five-day battle is being seen as a major test of what scientists and engineers have achieved in the sphere of artificial intelligence.  Go is a 3,000-year old Chinese board game and is considered to be a lot more complex than chess where artificial intelligence scored its most famous victory to date when IBM's Deep Blue beat grandmaster Gary Kasparov in 1997.  But experts say Go presents an entirely different challenge because of the game's incomputable number of move options which means that the computer must be capable of human-like "intuition" to prevail.  "Playing against a machine is very different from an actual human opponent," Mr Lee told the BBC ahead of the match.  "Normally, you can sense your opponent's breathing, their energy. And lots of times you make decisions which are dependent on the physical reactions of the person you're playing against.  "With a machine, you can't do that."  Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess.  There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.  Google's AlphaGo was developed by British computer company DeepMind which was bought by Google in 2014.  The computer program first studied common patterns that are repeated in past games, Demis Hassabis, DeepMind chief executive explained to the BBC.  "After it's learned that, it's got to reasonable standards by looking at professional games. It then played itself, different versions of itself millions and millions of times and each time get incrementally slightly better - it learns from its mistakes"  Learning and improving from its own matchplay experience means the super computer is now even stronger than when it beat the European champion late last year.	tech

One of mine almost was thanks to Minecraft.  One of my boys wanted to install a mod for it and needed me to approve it. And as I am paranoid about what runs on our main computer, I oversaw the whole process.  At first, it all looked fine.  There are thousands of mods or add-ons for Minecraft that make a variety of changes to the game. Some add new blocks, others change the way it looks and some turn it into an entirely different game.  The one he wanted was hard to find, despite it being popular among his friends. When we found it, I was not sure we were getting it from the person who actually created it.  I was suspicious because the site was festooned with buttons that looked like they would start the download but instead led to dead ends populated by links to download accelerators and other utilities we did not want. Grubby ads blinked alongside. I'm not sure mature Russian women are keen to meet my 12-year-old son.  Is your phone listening to you?  How to hack the average home  Hanging out with the script kiddies  After a few dead ends, we clicked the right link but then had to wait while we were put through several re-directs and a pop-up page that could not be shut down if we wanted the mod.  We did, so we stuck with it and the download started. And kept going. And going. Which was odd given it was only a few megabytes in size. My suspicions aroused, I killed the download over my son's protests. It was just as well. Running it through an online malware scanner revealed that though it was not actively malicious it would have installed adware and hijacked searches.  Definitely not the mod we wanted.  Soon afterwards, I found a warning about the page saying it was fake. That warning was circulated by the Stop Mod Reposts campaign. It is attempting to stop popular mods being hijacked by conmen, virus writers and cyber-thieves. It maintains a long, long list of the scam pages offering re-packaged mods. It even makes an extension for web browsers that warns when you stray on to a dodgy site.  "Minecraft is a huge target," said Chris Boyd, a security researcher at Malwarebytes and a veteran scam-spotter. He has seen fake sites offering the game for free, fake pages asking visitors to log in with their Minecraft name and password as well as a variety of other scams offering skins, capes and cheats.  But, he said, there was a long history of cyber-conmen going after children and the things they do online. He remembers seeing scams in 1999 that targeted the economy around Neopets - digital creatures popular with younger web users.  Keep all software up-to-date and patched. Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software. And a firewall.  Give your children an account on a PC or laptop that restricts what they can install.  Use strong passwords (mix letters, numbers and symbols) and do not share them. Not even with friends.  Be wary of links offered in chat forums or in-game.  Talk to your children about what is appropriate behaviour.  Choose neutral user names. Use different login details on different sites.  Do not reveal personal information, even to those who are being friendly.  Be sceptical of flashy ads and links to games, cheats, and freebies that offer in-game currencies.  Check if there is a way to restrict who children play with online. Check online privacy settings to see with whom data is being shared.  Younger gamers are regularly targeted, said Mark James of security firm Eset and many inadvertently give away their age with the names they choose when they sign up to a site or service.  Scammers and conmen can lurk in forums offering advice and links to extras, cheats and advice pages that are actually laced with malware.  "Often in-game chat channels play host to predators waiting for that click on a 'bad' link that infects a device," he said.  There is evidence that lurking on a gaming service pays off for the bad guys. Valve, which runs the massively popular Steam gaming service, revealed late last year that 77,000 accounts for the service are being hijacked each month. Control of those accounts will be lost via Steam's chat system or through booby-trapped links.  Mr James warned against befriending people on social media just to get "freebies" for games and said parents needed to educate children about safe browsing and gaming and what information was appropriate to share.  Without this, he said, children can be an easy target.  "If they want that mod or add-on they will do almost anything to get it," he said. "Unfortunately many young people do not have the perspective to see what long-term damage could be done if they are caught out."  Statistics from security firm Symantec suggest that younger people are getting hit regularly. A report it produced in early 2016 revealed that a quarter of parents have had a child or know someone with a child whose actions compromised the family's online security.  Jacqueline Beauchere, Microsoft's chief online safety officer, said scammers go to great lengths to catch children out.  "Young people are easily enticed to click flashy advertisements, visit unofficial websites of popular celebrities, download so-called 'free' games, and tap 'Agree', 'OK', or 'I accept' to quickly get to where and what they want to online," she said. "Many of these actions are just notorious pathways to viruses, spyware and other malicious software."  The scammers went after children, said Ms Beauchere, because of the cache of valuable loot that one mistake might lead them to.  "Among criminals, personal and financial data about any and all individuals has become the sought-after 'currency' of the web," she said. Cyber-thieves targeted children only to get at this data, she said.  Mr Boyd from Malwarebtyes agreed. And, he said, what helped the scammers was the way children typically get online.  "A lot of kids play via their parents tablets, laptops and desktops," he said. "It's quite likely that parents will re-use login details on other accounts. And there's likely to be a payment method attached to it."  That is the data they are after, he said.  What makes this tougher to police, he said, is that children often know more than their parents about the technology. That competence can fool many parents into thinking their offspring are safer online than they actually are.  "I would be surprised if parents know much about how the technology works," he said.  But, he added, staying safe is not impossible. It takes collaboration between parents and children. Both need to educate the other about what they do and how to stay safe.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35756258	SNP to vote against Sunday trading shake-up	The SNP has said it is to vote against UK government plans to change Sunday trading laws in England and Wales.  Proposals to allow English and Welsh councils to permit larger stores to open for more than six hours will not directly affect Scotland, where there are no trading restrictions in place.  But the SNP said it had concerns over the knock-on effects on Scottish pay.  With more than 20 Tory MPs set to rebel, the risk of a government defeat in a vote on Wednesday has increased.  MPs will vote on proposed changes to Sunday trading laws in what would be the biggest shake-up for 20 years.  Senior SNP officials in Westminster met on Tuesday to decide whether to order their 54 MPs to abstain in the vote, effectively allowing the proposals to pass, or to oppose them outright. They have decided to do the latter.  With Labour also opposing the changes and at least 21 Conservative MPs threatening to rebel, the SNP's stance could tip the balance in the vote.  At the moment in England and Wales, small shops - up to 280 sq m, or 3,000 sq ft in size - can open when they want to on Sundays but larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00. Retailers can be fined up to £50,000 if they break the rules.  The UK government's plans to give councils the freedom to determine opening hours will not apply directly to Scotland but the SNP has concerns about their impact on existing Sunday wage rates and people who do not want to work.  Stewart Hosie, the SNP's deputy leader, said the UK government had made concessions to protect workers but they did not go far enough in terms of safeguarding the "premium pay" rates he said Scottish workers currently enjoyed, control of which the SNP wants to be devolved.  "Protecting Scottish workers has been paramount to our decision to oppose the government's plans on Sunday Trading," he said. "We have had Sunday Trading in Scotland for some time and the SNP has never been opposed to it.  "However, our concerns here are rooted in the knock-on impact to Scottish workers who would be at risk of pay cuts - many of whom are already suffering from George Osborne's cuts to tax credits and other in-work support.  "SNP MPs have considered all sides in this debate and our decision has been made so workers in Scotland are protected."  The decision was welcomed by unions, which said "common sense had prevailed".  "Shopworkers across the UK will be relieved the SNP have eventually made the right decision to oppose Sunday trading changes that could impact on shop workers pay," said John Hannett, the general secretary of Usdaw.  Asked before the SNP announcement whether it was confident of Commons approval, Downing Street said it was clear about the economic benefits that could result from giving communities the power to determine opening hours.  "We think this is a way to enhance the ability of communities to support their High Streets to deal with some of the pressures that they face from the online market that we have these days and where we haven't updated Sunday trading rules to reflect that," a No 10 spokeswoman said.  Ministers say the change will help High Streets struggling to compete against online retailers and reflects changing leisure and working patterns.  But critics have said Sunday should remain a special day for people to spend with their family or pursuing other activities, including religious observance, free from added commercial pressure. They have expressed concerns that despite promised safeguards, staff will come under increased pressure to work from employers, and pointed out the proposals were not in the Conservatives' election manifesto.  In the run-up to the vote, 21 Conservative MPs signed an amendment to the Enterprise Bill opposing the changes.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has warned that the proposals would be the thin end of the wedge and could herald a full "seven-day society".  "If we march through those lobbies together tomorrow with a group of Conservatives who share our views - we will win and we'll keep Sundays as a different day - it's worth fighting for," he said during a visit to east London.  "For those with a strong Christian faith who wish to have a different Sunday I absolutely support them. For those who just want a different day of a week on a Sunday, a day they can get together with family... relaxation time, that's good."	politics

The government was twice defeated in the House of Lords over a £30 a week cut to Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for certain claimants.  But it is set to go ahead after peers deferred to the elected Commons.  Ministers claimed "financial privilege" to assert the Commons' right to have the final say on budgetary measures.  Ministers argue the changes will encourage people to get into work, but this is strongly disputed by opponents.  The cuts in weekly support from £103 to £73, contained in the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, will apply to new ESA claimants in the work-related activity group, bringing the rate into line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  It will affect people who are deemed unable to work at the moment but capable of making some effort to find employment, including attending work-focused interviews and taking part in training.  Ministers argue that too few people in the category are moving into work and that while the lower benefit rate would save £55m in the first year, £60m would be spent on supporting claimants to take steps towards finding work.  Work and Pensions minister Lord Freud acknowledged peers were only withdrawing their opposition with "great reluctance" after the Commons asserted financial privilege - its right to overrule any Lords proposal that has cost implications.  He insisted that the Lords had "discharged their duty" by scrutinising the bill to remove "unintended consequences" and sending back concerns for the Commons to reconsider.  But Paralympic gold medallist Baroness Grey-Thompson said she was disappointed such a "dreadful and punitive" part of the bill - which has been opposed by more than 30 charities - was going ahead.  "It may be seen as a victory in terms of voting numbers in the Commons but we can't forget there are many disabled people who will lose out," the crossbench peer said.  And Baroness Campbell of Surbiton, the co-chair of Parliament's All Party Disability Group, said she could not believe "the niceties of parliamentary protocol" had been allowed "to trump the lives of disabled people".  The peer, who was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy when she was a baby and has become one of the UK's leading disability rights campaigners, said there was little evidence to back up the government's claims and "environmental and attitudinal discrimination" was the main obstacle holding disabled people back in the workplace.  Disability rights campaigners Scope said the changes would have a "harmful impact" on half a million people.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35752658	Skype ditches support for smart TVs	Skype has announced that it is ending support for its smart TV software.  The Microsoft-owned chat app said that the move reflected the public preference for using mobile devices to make video calls from the living room, despite the size advantage TVs offered.  It will continue to maintain the service until June.  Afterwards, it will be up to individual manufacturers to decide whether to remove the app or continue offering an unsupported service.  Skype's intention to focus its efforts on phones and tablets comes at a time when it faces heightened competition.  Although Google's rival Hangouts service has had limited appeal on mobiles, Facebook's Messenger and Apple's Facetime apps are making more headway.  In addition, Xiaomi recently launched its own Mi Video Call service, and Slack has announced plans to add support for video chats to its popular business-focused chat tool.  Skype for TV was first unveiled at the CES tech show in January 2010 and was marketed as a way to let families "share the limelight [from their sofa] so there's no more huddling around the computer or missing an out-of-shot moment".  It required TVs to be fitted with either a built-in camera or a plug-in peripheral.  TV-makers that adopted the service included Samsung, LG, Sony, Panasonic, Sharp, Toshiba and Philips.  "Over the years, users have changed the way they use Skype, with the majority accessing it from a mobile device - including when in the living room," reads a message posted to the app's support page.  "We want to make sure we prioritise delivering the best possible experience to the platforms our users are asking for, which is why we've decided to focus our efforts in other areas while supporting key functionality on Skype for TV for as long as possible."  Samsung has already announced that its TVs will stop offering the app from 2 June.  Many science-fiction movies and comics had envisioned that people would want to chat to each other via large screens in their homes.  But one expert said that technology had gone down a "very different route".  "On paper the idea of using a TV for things like Skype made a lot of sense - it's a non-threatening device that people were already comfortable with, so it seemed a good way to get the tech into the living room," said Chris Green, a technology analyst at the consultancy Lewis.  "But the ubiquity of mobile devices made video conferencing on TVs redundant.  "No-one ever got used to using a big screen for Skype because they never needed to - people are far more used to picking up a tablet and doing it that way - and I don't think there's a way back now."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35753973	Apple faces US appeal to force it to unlock iPhone	US authorities are appealing against a judge's decision not to order Apple to unlock an iPhone in a drugs case.  The Justice Department is relying on the same law as the one in its fight with Apple over the encrypted phone belonging to the San Bernardino gunman.  It has gone to a higher court after a Brooklyn judge said he had no power to give the order.  Apple said the order would be the start of a "slippery slope that threatens everyone's safety and privacy".  In the original hearing, the US government asked Judge James Orenstein to order Apple to open up a locked phone belonging to Jun Feng, who has pleaded guilty to participation in a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy. The Justice Department wants to use the device to find any of his co-conspirators.  After Judge Orenstein's decision last week, the government resubmitted its arguments to a higher judge overseeing the matter.  While the case has similarities with that being heard in California in relation to the San Bernardino shootings, the New York case involves an older version of Apple's operating system. Feng's phone uses iOS 7, which is not protected by the same encryption technology.  "Apple has the technological capability to bypass the passcode feature and access the contents of the phone that were unencrypted," the Justice Department said in its court filing, submitted on Monday. It has asked District Court Judge Margot Brodie to hear the case. The Justice Department's lawyers called the request routine, arguing that the case was neither about asking Apple to do anything new, nor to create a "master key" to access all iPhones.  The government said Judge Orenstein's ruling was an "unprecedented limitation on" judicial authority and that his legal "analysis goes far afield of the circumstances of this case". It also stated that the government "does not have any adequate alternatives" to obtaining Apple's assistance because attempting to guess the passcode would trigger the phone's auto-erase security feature.  Federal prosecutors cited several examples in which Apple has extracted data from a locked device under the law. Apple argues that it has opposed requests to help extract information from more than a dozen iPhones since being invited to challenge the government's use of the 1789 All Writs Act by Judge Orenstein in October last year.  The technology firm said it agreed with Judge Orenstein's ruling that granting the request would "thoroughly undermine fundamental principles of the constitution". It said: "We share the judge's concern that misuse of the All Writs Act would start us down a slippery slope that threatens everyone's safety and privacy."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35752728	Microsoft releases Linux database software	Microsoft has produced a version of its database software that runs on the rival Linux operating system.  The version of SQL Server software it has made for Linux will be released in mid-2017, it said in a blogpost.  The creation of the software is a significant step for Microsoft which has traditionally focused on its core Windows operating system.  It is one of several steps it has taken to open up its software to rivals under boss Satya Nadella.  Microsoft's SQL Server is one of the company's core products and the Windows version is used by many customers to run and manage databases.  Scott Guthrie, head of Microsoft's cloud and enterprise group, said the Linux version was currently being previewed and tested by customers but would be fully available by the middle of next year. He said Renault's Formula 1 racing team was one of the first test customers for the code.  Microsoft has about a 21% share of the database software market, suggest figures from analyst firm Gartner.  Oracle is the market leader and the release of SQL Server for Linux will help Microsoft compete with that company, it said.  Gartner analyst Merv Adrian told Reuters that the move made sense because although business spending on technology had been "lacklustre" the amount of cash firms spent to maintain and update database software had kept rising.  Mr Adrian said Oracle would undoubtedly notice Microsoft's step into the Linux market.  "It's a significant competitive threat they didn't have before," he said.  The move also puts Microsoft into more direct competition with IBM and SAP. There are also a lot of free Linux-based database programs available.  The release of SQL Server is one among several steps Microsoft has taken to work more closely with Linux and its advocates.  The data centre management software Microsoft uses for its Azure service is based on Linux; it has also produced software that helps people manage Linux servers and has released an analytics package called R Server that works with several different versions of Linux.  The greater willingness to work with former rivals has been one of the hallmarks of boss Satya Nadella's reign at Microsoft. Mr Nadella took over as chief executive in February 2014.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35752625	An anti-social experiment	Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter - social media tools that only entered our lives in the last decade but quickly became indispensable. Now a thousand school children in Cheshire are trying to find out what life was like in the era before social media.  As part of BBC News School Report, pupils at Tarporley High School are going through a digital detox. From last Wednesday they agreed to give up all social media, YouTube and video games for a week. Some adults - not me, I hasten to add - might think that was pretty painless. After all, the pupils' phones were not being confiscated and they were still allowed to call, email or text.  But what this experiment has shown so far is just how central to the lives of teenagers social networks and messaging tools have become. Three of the Year-10 students have been reporting on the detox for School Report. Here's what they say about the assembly where the idea was explained:  "The thought of having real conversations and maybe even reading a book seems to be way too much to handle. Many hands are raised when asked who uses games but pretty much everyone seems to use social media on a day to day basis." One teacher tells the reporters he welcomes the experiment: "Social media is becoming increasingly invasive, verging on obsessive."  But if your primary means of communication is taken away that is bound to cause problems. Twenty five years ago, teenagers would have been furious if they had been told they could not use the home telephone. Today, taking away Snapchat or Facebook Messenger can provoke a similar reaction.  It was bad enough on school days, but the pupils had been dreading a weekend without social media. So on Monday I spoke to three of the pupils to see how they were getting on. Daisy, who's 14, said she had been quite positive about the experiment in advance - she had worked out she had spent 16 hours on Snapchat the previous week and was quite looking forward to not feeling the pressure to check her phone all the time.  But she had found it hard over the weekend: "I had to turn off notifications not to be tempted." She had rediscovered some old forms of communication - sending emails to friends abroad, and even making phone calls.  "I'm not totally obsessed, I do have a normal life," says 15-year-old Georgia about her use of social media. But beforehand she still worried what her friends would think if she simply disappeared from social media. Seeing that she had Snapchat messages that she could not open had been really hard, but there has been an upside: "I've been looking at newspapers and magazines," she says, "and talking to my parents about other things than them being my taxi drivers!"  Patrick, who's 14 and spends a lot of time watching YouTube and talking to friends while playing Fifa, had found the weekend painful. "I was in the car and I must have picked up the phone 50 times and then put it down." Organising meetings with friends had been difficult - he had to phone them individually. "None of us speak on the phone or email. It's more efficient to use things like Snapchat - it's cheaper and nobody is listening."  Of the 1,000 pupils who started the digital detox, around a quarter have so far admitted to giving up. Among them is Sam, who broke the pledge when he was due to play tennis and didn't have the phone number of the student he was due to meet. He never calls anyone and has no numbers stored in his phone, so the only answer was to use Snapchat to make the arrangement.  It sounds as though most of the school's pupils will be mightily relieved when the detox ends and they can return to the modern communications era. But the Tarporley High School librarian might like the experiment to continue - she says she has never seen as many books borrowed as during the last week.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35749080	Cannabis should be legalised and regulated, Lib Dems say	The Liberal Democrats are backing a new report calling for the legalised sale of marijuana through licensed outlets, including "cannabis social clubs".  Criminalising cannabis use is a waste of police time, they say, and increases health risks by leaving many people in the dark about what they are taking.  The party is calling for a "regulated market" to control the pricing, potency and packaging of sales to over-18s.  The Conservatives rejected Lib Dem calls to review drug laws in coalition.  The Lib Dems' attempts to put the issue on the political agenda while in government were rebuffed by Home Secretary Theresa May, who argued existing laws were proving successful in reducing drug use and the harm associated with it.  Cannabis is currently classified as a Class B drug, with possession carrying a maximum sentence of five years in jail or an unlimited fine. Those supplying or producing cannabis face tougher penalties, with up to a maximum of 14 years in jail.  But the Lib Dems say the existing "war on drugs" has failed, diverting police resources away from tackling organised crime and that people using cannabis should not be "saddled with criminal convictions" for the rest of their lives.  The party has endorsed a new study, written by an independent panel of advisers, which calls for:  The report, whose authors include the government's former chief drugs adviser Sir David Nutt and Mike Barton, the Chief Constable of Durham Constabulary, argues that cannabis should be taxed according to its strength and that doing so could yield up to £1bn a year for the Exchequer.  It claims the health risks associated with cannabis use can be more effectively managed and minimised by through a "responsibly regulated market and public health interventions rather than an unregulated criminal market and punitive criminal justice response".  The Lib Dems will decide whether to adopt the proposals as party policy at its Spring Conference this weekend.  Under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971, illegal drugs are divided into Class A, B and C. Penalties are most severe for Class A drugs like crack cocaine and heroin, and least severe for Class C drugs like khat and anabolic steroids.  Producing or supplying a Class A drug can be punished with life imprisonment, while there is a 14-year maximum term for Class B and C.  Possession is treated less severely, with maximum sentences of seven, five and two years for Class A, B and C respectively. Warnings and on-the-spot fines are sometimes given for possession of drugs. Read more  "Every year, billions of pounds are put into the pockets of organised criminals selling cannabis, and vast amounts of police time and resources are wasted, going after those using the drug," said its health spokesman Norman Lamb.  "It is not good enough to continue pretending that everything is OK, or that the current system is working. Millions of British citizens are using cannabis with no idea of the potency of what they are taking.  "The current system is doing untold harm: on health grounds and on justice grounds. Leaving the cannabis market in the hands of criminals puts people's health at risk, and criminalises people, blighting their careers."  Steve Rolles, an analyst at the Transform Drug Policy Foundation - who chaired the panel - said the debate was no longer theoretical as cannabis had been legalised for recreational use in a number of US states and that Canada would soon follow suit.  "Over the decades politicians have done great work in cross party settings to explore alternatives to criminalisation and we hope that our report will further assist in taking some of the heat out of the debate," he said.  The Home Office has said it has no plans to change the law, insisting there is "clear scientific and medical evidence that cannabis is a harmful drug which can damage people's mental and physical health, and harms individuals and communities".	politics

He is nervous.  But you would be if you were representing the human race against a very clever machine. Mr Lee is the world champion at baduk (or Go as the board-game is known through much of the world).  He's due to play a computer with a programme devised by Google. The winner will take away about a million dollars - not that AlphaGo, as the programme is called, will be able to spend it.  AlphaGo has already beaten the European champion but, experts say, this is easy-peasy compared to taking on the masters in Asia - it would be like beating some non-league football side compared to playing Barcelona.  Mr Lee is the reigning human champion of the planet (though a Chinese contender is running close).  "Playing against a machine is very different from an actual human opponent," the world's Number 1 told the BBC.  "Normally, you can sense your opponent's breathing, their energy. And lots of times you make decisions which are dependent on the physical reactions of the person you're playing against.  "With a machine, you can't do that."  That's because emotion and character play a large part of the game. In chess, there are fewer possible permutations because it's played on a board of eight squares by eight (compared with 19 by 19 on a Go board).  As the British Go Association explains: "At the opening move in chess there are 20 possible moves. In Go, the first player has 361 possible moves.  "This wide latitude of choice continues throughout the game," it adds.  "At each move the opposing player is more likely than not to be surprised at his opponent's move, and hence he must rethink his own plan of attack. Self-discipline is a major factor in success at this game".  The number of permutations in a game of Go is greater than the number of atoms in the universe, according to the Nature science journal, "so it can't be solved by algorithms that search exhaustively for the best move".  For this reason, it's not just a matter of the cold calculus of a computer working out permutations - or so Lee Se-dol hopes.  But he doesn't seem sure: "I've been telling people that I was certain that I would be the winner of all five matches. But Google - which developed the programme - seems to be quite confident, too".  He is spooked by the idea that the computer can adapt its game as it learns its opponent's style - his mechanical opponent will adapt its style as it studies his.  This idea that a computer can learn how to ultimately beat a human has frightening possibilities if it were ever eventually translated into weapons, for example.  "I hope this advanced technology will be used for useful things but I do fear that perhaps things may happen and turn out like a scene from a science fiction film," Mr Lee says.  "I think things like intuition, being able to make individual value judgments are all part of human character.  "If I do get a sense that a machine is starting to act or think like me, it will be frightening. But also we'll know for sure that this kind of technology now possesses the true potential for beneficial solutions and help the way we live".  Go was invented by the Chinese 2,500 years ago or thereabouts. It's sometimes called an "imperial game" because it's about controlling territory (on the board) as opposed to chess which is about capturing the king.  Both are too complex for a computer to predict every move with utter certainty, through the brute force of computing power. Computers - like humans - have to assess.  As the Nature journal explained: "Chess is less complex than Go, but it still has too many possible configurations to solve by brute force alone. Instead, programs cut down their searches by looking a few turns ahead and judging which player would have the upper hand."  It added that recognising winning positions was also hard to do since Go's stones have equal values and can have "subtle impacts far across the board".  AlphaGo learned the pattern of stones by ingesting 30 million positions from expert games..  It worked out which positions were likely to be winning ones, and then - and this is the master-stroke - it played itself repeatedly to improve its own play. In other words, it learned.  So, this five-match tournament between man and machine feels like a contest for the supremacy of the future.  In the Four Seasons Hotel in Seoul, Google has a big public relations operation. Amidst all the glitz and smooth operatives of the corporate behemoth, Lee Se-dol seems like a small, shy figure, with a quiet voice and nervous hands.  Shy man versus big machine: who do you want to win?	tech

Cables were at risk of "degrading", some pipe work was 40 years old while the parliamentary estate was rife with asbestos, experts told a committee examining restoration options.  Engineer Nick Mead said relocating MPs and peers during any building work was the "most straightforward" option.  No work is expected before 2020.  The Commons and Lords will have to vote in the next few years on what to do about the state of the 150-year-old Grade I listed building, redesigned in the mid 19th Century by architects Charles Barry and Augustus Pugin following a catastrophic fire.  The Palace of Westminster is partly sinking, much of its fabric outdated, and has been subject to a rolling programme of repairs for decades.  A report published last year concluded that a wholesale restoration of the Palace without moving MPs and peers out would cost £5.7bn and take 32 years. On the other hand, if MP and peers were moved out for six years, the cost would drop to £3.5bn.  MPs and peers looking at the various options available were told on Monday that a huge backlog of maintenance had built up and was unlikely to be cleared if the current programme of continuous repairs continued, another possible outcome.  Many of the building's internal systems had long ago reached the end of their natural lifespan, four leading experts said, while the building had been damaged by climate changes, with rainwater disposal systems struggling to cope with more "intense storm surges".  Mr Mead, president of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers, said there was a critical need for the building's electrical and pipe work to be renewed.  Asked what the risks were if comprehensive repairs were not undertaken by 2030, he replied "they would start" with circuits and cables fraying.  "The burnout of a cable may seem insignificant but the consequences are quite major," he said.  "Electrical cables have a life, 15 to 20 years. You have a number of hidden cables. You don't know the state they are in. The worst consequence is a fire and the catastrophic effect of that, given the amount of wood and finishes in this building.  "But there is also the more destructive nature. If you were to lose your power in the middle of a debate or you lost your lighting, the consequences of that. The pipe work is of an age where it corrodes from the inside. You will suddenly get a leak, a loss of heat."  Lynda Jubb, from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, estimated the maintenance backlog cost at £2.1bn and said Parliament "had a number of factors working against it in terms of trying to stay on top of the condition".  Asked whether the building could be brought up to scratch without a full or partial evacuation, she said this was "difficult to see".  While there was a "precedent" for MPs and peers moving out to a different location, she acknowledged any such plans would be "very disruptive" and were likely to be met with resistance.  "If this is a life's work, this is a life's work," she said. "I think the original refurbishment took 32 years.  "The problem that Charles Barry had was asking members to move between chambers. I think he had great difficulty in getting space relinquished in order to get work done and that was the primary cause of delay at that time.  "In terms of life safety risk for construction workers, you have to understand that you are asking people to go into spaces where there is asbestos and to work in already difficult and dangerous conditions and also the duty of care that people who are working here have to you.  "That relationship is extremely difficult to manage and the cost of getting it wrong are unconscionable."  Ideas for a new temporary home for MPs and peers include the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre or the Methodist Central Hall, both a few hundred metres from the Palace of Westminster on the other side of Parliament square.  David Cameron has suggested that MPs could move into the Chamber of the House of Lords while work is carried out elsewhere on the estate, as happened between June 1941 and 1950 after the Commons chamber was completely destroyed by German bombing.	politics

The latest instalment, Fable Legends, had been in development at Lionhead Studios for more than two years and was due to be released in the spring.  Work on it will now cease, the firm said in a blog post.  The studio was founded by Peter Molyneux in 1996 and was bought by Microsoft ten years later.  Press Play Studios in Denmark, which created Max: the Curse of Brotherhood and Kalimba, will also be closed.  "These have been tough decisions and we have not made them lightly," wrote Hanno Lemke, general manager of Microsoft Studios Europe.  "We have nothing but heartfelt thanks for the members of Lionhead and Press Play for their contributions to Xbox and gaming," he added.  James Batchelor, editor of Develop magazine, told the BBC the closure of Lionhead would be a blow for the UK video gaming industry.  "It's a fantastic studio," he said.  "One that really shows a proper British sense of humour in its games - lots of talented people work there."  But he said that deciding to halt a game like Fable Legends after so long in development is not that uncommon.  "It happens - sometimes for some reason [a studio] can't make it the hit they want it to be. That's the risk of development, particularly when you openly announce a game and raise expectations."  A year ago Fable Legends was being described by Microsoft as its 'hero title' for gaming on Windows 10. There'd be full cross-platform support, Xbox Live integration, and cross-play. But that's come to a very abrupt end with the shuttering of Lionhead Studios.  And games studios never close; they are, in the language of the industry, shuttered.  It's an ignominious end for a studio with a 20 year history but Lionhead always seemed to have a reach that exceeded its grasp. That was probably down to the influence of one of its founders, Peter Molyneux who left in 2012  Molyneux is one of the most interesting, and divisive, figures in the UK's games industry. Depending on your point of view he was either a visionary who helped create wonderful, innovative games or a showman whose ambitions never quite came to fruition.  What is certain is that in the final assessment Lionhead will be seen as a great seedbed for British talent and that this is a sad moment for the UK industry.  However, we'll just have to hope that the adage that two studios spring up when one closes holds true.  The news soon began to trend on social media.  "So sad to hear about Lionhead - that's another little bit of gaming history gone," tweeted Eurogamer's Aoife Wilson.  "Lionhead studios have shaped my life and I'm really not prepared for them to close," added Thom_AFC.  "This is a sad day for Lionhead, the Guildford Studio cluster and for the wider UK video games industry," said Dr Richard Wilson, chief executive of video games industry body Tiga.  "Lionhead's talented development workforce has made some hugely successful and iconic games over the last 20 years including Black & White and the Fable franchise.  "We hope that the Lionhead team will find new work with other developers or set up new studios to repeat Lionhead's successes."	tech

Some are worried the chancellor could announce a rise in next week's Budget.  A Treasury minister is to meet fuel campaigners, including the Tory MP Jason McCartney, on Tuesday.  Mr McCartney said he was very concerned and would be urging colleagues to lobby Treasury ministers and officials and is to email every MP warning a rise is rumoured and seeking their opinions.  "We'll be mobilising all the supporters of the Fair Fuel group in Parliament this week," he said.  Treasury minister Damian Hinds is to meet McCartney and representatives from the Fair Fuel UK Campaign at noon on Tuesday.  Another Conservative MP said any rise in duty would be outrageous.  A Sunday Times report that an unnamed minister had said people would hardly notice an extra 2p on petrol has alarmed some backbenchers.  Mr McCartney said: "Me and my Conservative colleagues will really be making the case as strongly as we can this week to Treasury ministers and Treasury officials that we need to continue this good work that we've done."  A Treasury source said reports of a possible rise were speculative.  In an interview with the BBC last month Chancellor George Osborne declined to rule out a rise in fuel duty, but added there was a clear commitment in the Conservative manifesto to help working people.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35744338	Amazon makes U-turn over Fire tablet encryption	Amazon has pledged to restore disk encryption security protection to its mobile operating system.  The firm had faced criticism after it emerged that the feature had been dropped in a recent update to Fire OS.  Amazon had justified the move by saying that "customers weren't using" the privacy facility. It now intends to reintroduce it before the end of May.  Disk encryption has become a topical issue as it lies at the heart of a clash between Apple and the FBI.  The facility digitally scrambles data on a device, making it impossible to make sense of it unless a passcode or other ID check is provided.  The dispute involving Apple concerns the tech firm's refusal to alter its own mobile operating system to prevent an iPhone's data being wiped if too many incorrect passcode guesses are typed in.  Amazon has publicly backed Apple's stance via a legal filing known as an amicus brief, which was submitted to a US court last week.  Amazon removed disk encryption when it released Fire OS 5 last year. It included the operating system with its Fire tablets, as well as its TV-streaming devices.  However, a backlash only occurred after Amazon started making the update available to owners of its older Fire tablets, who noticed the security facility was no longer available.  "I will no longer be able to keep my business email... as our institution requires that encryption be used," wrote one tablet owner on the firm's forums. "I cannot believe Amazon just 'deleted' this critical feature."  Another posted: "In an era where devices store information on everything from browsing habits to bank information it's nearly unthinkable for a company to deliberately remove the one feature that can protect a customer from identity theft if their device is lost or stolen."  The firm reversed its stance over the weekend.  "We will return the option for full disk encryption with a Fire OS update coming this spring," a spokesman told the BBC.  The flip-flop has not affected the firm's continued use of encryption to protect data sent between its devices and its data centres.  Google offers full device encryption in its version of the operating system, and in October told device manufacturers that it should be switched on by default in new handsets powerful enough to support it.  One expert suggested Amazon should take a similar step.  "There's growing recognition that better security is needed in the whole sphere of computing and particularly mobile devices," commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London.  "So, I was surprised when Amazon removed the feature.  "It's certainly possible that many people didn't enable it - perhaps they found it inconvenient to do so. But rather than remove it, a better solution would be to make it more easy to use."	tech

The security researchers from Palo Alto Networks believe it is the first time ransomware has appeared on Macs.  The KeRangers malware was hidden in a version of a BitTorrent client called Transmission.  The makers of Transmission and Apple say they have taken steps to stop the malware spreading.  It is not clear how many people were affected.  Transmission is a program that lets people download and share BitTorrent files - often music or movies - with other users' computers.  After being informed of the malware, Apple revoked the developers' certificate on the infected software to prevent it from being installed if people downloaded it.  Transmission's developers released a new version of their software and added a notice on their website, urging customers to upgrade immediately.  Apple's Mac operating system - Mac OS X - has traditionally been considered to be a secure system because it is more locked down than the myriad of devices running Windows operating systems.  While writing malware code for Macs is more difficult because there is less of it around, as the computers become more commonly used criminals are working harder to target them, Greg Day, Palo Alto Networks' chief security officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa told the BBC.  "In all honesty unfortunately this is a likely outcome," he said of his team's discovery.  "There is a simple reality which is criminals will follow us as users of IT to generate ransom.  "We've seen more Mac threats in the last few years - it's a very good reminder that there is no environment which is risk free from cyber attack."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35726665	How does David Cameron avoid Commons defeats?	Where are the rebellions? Where are the government defeats in the Commons?  When David Cameron formed the first Conservative government since the demise of John Major's in 1997, most observers (me included) thought his narrow Commons majority would spell trouble, not least because a significant number of Tory backbenchers had acquired quite a taste for rebellion during the coalition years.  But so far, barring one admittedly stinging lost amendment on EU referendum purdah rules, there has been no repetition of the prime minister's abject and almost unprecedented humiliation in the 2013 vote on military intervention in Syria.  Even the increasingly snippy Euro-feuding in Tory ranks has not endangered that majority.  There are all kinds of reasons why.  First that majority is over a fragmented opposition; for the government to lose a Commons vote, it must be on an issue that unites Labour and the SNP, at least some of the smaller parties, and a number of Tory dissidents (a task made all the harder by the possibility that Labour MPs could split over a variety of contentious issues - Trident replacement, anyone?).  The Sunday trading vote is a case in point; as I write 22 Conservatives (and rising) have signed a Commons amendment to the Enterprise Bill to strike down the government's proposals to loosen the current restrictions.  But they are more than outweighed by the likely support of the SNP.  The Opposition can't beat the government in the Commons unless almost all its component parties are lined up to vote against it.  Just one opposition-uniting issue (EU purdah) has appeared so far, although next week's vote on Sunday trading and, further down the road, the newly published Investigatory Powers Bill might just provide more.  It's an interesting question how far the dearth of such issues is down to conscious choice.  The 19th Century maxim that Whigs were about legislation and Tories were about administration may be coming back into force; the Cameron government's most contentious actions often seem to be administrative - not needing a Commons vote at all, or perhaps requiring secondary legislation rather than a full-dress bill. It's the hallmark of a very cautious government.  What all this implies is that there are occasions where the smaller parties can exercise considerable leverage.  They can choose their moment carefully, wait until the government is committed to a position and then search their souls and discover a reason not to support it.  Then they can allow themselves to be wooed back into the fold by suitable sweeteners.  Perhaps this is one of the factors behind the government's impending climb-down on cuts to Short Money, likely to be embodied in a resolution of the House next week.  Short Money - named after the former Labour Deputy Leader Ted Short - is the money paid to opposition parties to support their Parliamentary work; the cuts were much resented by the smaller parties and certainly made the government business managers' lives harder.  And at the heart of the government's undefeated Commons record, is the Tory whips office.  Chief Whip Mark Harper ("the best Chief for a generation," one source told me) gets good reviews from some surprising people, for smart judgement of the mood of his Commons flock.  The whips have all kinds of ways of making the lives of errant MPs difficult, and the "usual suspect" rebels may think his punishments of their infractions are heavy-handed - they would, wouldn't they?  But loyalists, especially those who, if you will excuse the mixed metaphor, have to grit their teeth when they toe the line, rather relish the resounding public smack of firm government. A number thoroughly enjoyed the removal of awkward squaddie Chris Chope from a plum role on the Council of Europe.  In the last Parliament the EU was a deadly issue for the Conservative leadership; it was John Barron's precision-targeted amendment to the Queen's Speech regretting the lack of an EU referendum that forced the Conservative leadership into attempting to get a referendum bill through as a Private Members Bill (the Lib Dems vetoed having a full government Bill) and then into the manifesto commitment which led inexorably to the vote due in June.  The leadership may not have liked it, but it produced a position around which the Conservative Party could unify - for the time being.  So in this Parliament, with a referendum legislated for and a date set, there have been few occasions for euro-rebellion.  But what happens after the referendum is anyone's guess.  Acrimony is on the rise in the referendum debate, words are being spoken that will not be easily forgotten, and the prime minister and Mr Harper will doubtless be pondering the exact combination of reconciliation and revenge they should deploy to keep the party together.  They will be helped by the increasing realisation that, given Labour's disarray, the Tories could be in power for quite a while, as long as they avoid civil war.  That message is being whispered into certain ears by a group of Parliamentary patriarchs who retain post-traumatic memories of the Maastricht era and its disastrous impact on the Major government.  As we know, referendums are supposed to settle big questions the parties in parliament cannot resolve for themselves, and settle them for a generation.  And as we also know, it doesn't always work out that way; ask the SNP.  Disappointment is one of the most corrosive emotions in politics, and a close vote to stay in will mean the Euro-pot continues to simmer and may occasionally boil over.  It could provoke a Commons guerrilla campaign by some Conservative Brexiteers, against contentious EU-related measures, but, again, for them to win they would need the support of the mostly pro-EU opposition parties, which looks improbable on most issues.  On the other hand, a vote to leave will overturn the Tory top table, and result in a new leadership, leaving the pro-EU wing with nowhere to go.  It is hard to imagine pro-EU Tories daring to defy a referendum vote to leave, by rebelling on the necessary legislation.  There are many cleaner ways to commit political suicide than that. But a close Remain vote is more dangerous to party unity.	politics

Count to 10, my friend. Sleep on it.  Another is sending an email containing brutal, heart-breaking words that, really, should be said in person… if only he had the nerve.  And of course, a Nigerian price is considering how best to ask for my help in spending his fortune.  Email does curious things to us. We worry about getting emails, we worry about not getting emails.  Before joining the BBC, I'd live by the popular freelancer's mantra that a watched inbox never fills, so I'd go for walk in the hope of returning to offers of work.  Now I'm desperate for "inbox zero".  Email became part of everyday life so quickly we didn't have enough time to learn how to properly use it - until there was no turning back, and bad habits were set in stone.  To make things worse, the Blackberry brought email away from our computers and into our palms - and therefore our bedrooms, our commutes and our toilet breaks.  In doing so, we willingly let email seep into our lives, instigating an anxiety we'd not yet encountered. One study in 2014 took email away from 13 US government workers. The result? Their average heart-rates decreased.  And that's because for anyone with any kind of office job, the temptation - or perhaps pressure - to be on top of your emails can be overwhelming.  In France, there have even been calls to enforce some kind of "digital work hour" restriction, because checking your email after work is, after all, free labour.  Yet, for all its faults, we've still not found anything better.  Which is why, as the technology world mourns the loss of Ray Tomlinson, it's only right to spend a moment to appreciate what a remarkable contribution he made to the business of communication.  He's credited as sending the first email as we know it today - and commandeering the @ symbol as a way to simplify how it works.  The first messages were sent between computers that were a mere 10-feet apart, but the feat was enormous.  For something so groundbreaking, it was adorably anti-climatic. Just read how he described it during an interview in 2009.  "Every time you test you have to generate some sort of message.  "You might drag your fingers across the keyboard or just type the opening phrase from Lincoln's Gettysburg address or something else - so technically the first email is completely forgettable and therefore forgotten."  In the following decades, the @ sign has gone from being a barely-used character to one we use multiple times a day. As NPR put it, Mr Tomlinson changed @ from a symbol into an icon.  Yes there's spam. Yes there's phishing attacks. Yes there's work mailing lists that ding constantly, or "reply all" fiascos where people ignorantly plead to be "taken off this list".  But email itself has never been the problem, just the people that use it.  That said, one hopes email is replaced one day. It's widely accepted that it's not an efficient communication method, and it hits the focus of anyone trying to get things done.  But what could possibly come next?  In the past year we've seen companies like Slack try and reinvent workplace communication, but while such tools are great for chatting internally, it does little to improve talking to those who work outside of your company.  In its quest for world domination, Facebook has long wanted us to ditch using email and instead shift over to using the Facebook inbox.  But I don't know about you, my Facebook inbox is one of the few safe spaces I have on the internet: an area where work does not overflow into my personal life. I'd like to keep it that way.  Soon, we're expecting Facebook will expand its Facebook At Work service, offering it to all businesses around the world. It's being trialled by a selection of firms, including the likes of RBS and Heineken. The idea is that communication tools we're all familiar with when talking to our friends can surely help us chat at work. Minus the cat videos.  If Facebook provides a way to separate work life from personal life, then great. Like Slack, it seems to work best when talking to people you already work with. If the rest of it just becomes a place to send and receive messages in chronological order... that's just an email inbox in disguise.  And we're back to where Ray Tomlinson started in 1971. 1971! This is an industry that moves quicker than any other, where start-ups come and go in a matter of weeks.  And yet Mr Tomlinson's innovation has endured for 45 years - and shows no sign of going anywhere yet.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

The CMS was switched off for maintenance when BBC Click visited allowing Spencer Kelly to be given a rare chance to glimpse inside it.  In 2012, the LHC detected the sub-atomic Higgs boson particle. The Higgs is a cornerstone of the Standard Model theory, which explains how particles interact.  Scientists working at the LHC announced the discovery of a new particle called the pentaquark in 2015. It was first predicted to exist in the 1960s, but was not proven until its detection at the LHC.  More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	tech

David Cameron has said he has secured a commitment to exempt the UK from "ever closer union".  But Mr Johnson told the BBC's Andrew Marr the EU wanted a "superstate into which we would inevitably be dragged".  Instead, he said, the UK had a "once in a lifetime opportunity" to make its own relationships with other nations.  Mr Johnson said the outcome of Mr Cameron's negotiations on EU reform had led to his decision to support a vote to leave in June's referendum.  "We were told were going to get wholesale changes," he said.  "Anybody looking at the agreement that we have before us now would be in no doubt that this is not fundamental reform.  "The next item on the agenda is the further evolution of what was a common market into this superstate into which we would inevitably be dragged."  In February the government announced it had reached a deal to set out the UK's relationship with the EU. The prime minister had wanted an opt-out of the EU's founding ambition to forge an "ever closer union".  The final deal said the UK "is not committed to further political integration into the European Union" and that this would be incorporated into EU treaties.  Asked why he chose to go against his party's leader, Conservative MP Mr Johnson said he had been involved in discussions in the days leading up to the EU summit which finalised the deal.  Government lawyers had said measures to bolster British courts and the House of Commons were not compatible with EU membership, he claimed.  He claimed a "huge intellectual effort" had gone into trying to ensure that UK courts and Parliament could overrule the EU Court of Justice, which interprets EU law and ensures it is applied across all members states.  "The government lawyers just blew up," Mr Johnson said.  "They said this basically voids our obligations under the 1972 European Communities Act. It doesn't work."  He argued: "You cannot express the sovereignty of Parliament and accept the 1972 European Communities Act."  The UK officially became a member of what was then the European Economic Community in 1973, after the passage of the act the previous year.  A Downing Street source said he did not recognise Mr Johnson's description of the run-up to the EU deal.  Labour MP and former cabinet minister Yvette Cooper called the London mayor's comments "wiffle waffle".  She told Sky News: "You've just got an increasingly hysterical battle for the future of the Tory party and they are trying to hijack the future of the country. We cannot let them do that.  "This has got to be about our future as Britain and why we'll be stronger in Europe and not get sucked into a battle between old Etonians about their political parties."  Meanwhile, a BBC survey of grassroots Conservatives pointed to a lack of consensus in the party on what the PM's negotiations with EU leaders had achieved.  Of the 128 Tory constituency chairmen who replied, 54 said they would vote for the UK to leave the EU, while 31 said they would vote for the UK to remain and 42 said they had yet to make up their minds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35731925	Week ahead	I'm not sure we're quite into "zombie Parliament" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon.  The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.  Elsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords "ping-pong" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.  Then it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:  In the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the "Work Related Activities Group", and content themselves with a "regret" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another "regret motion" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.  And that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.  The Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.  He says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.  After that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.  And there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.  There will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.  In Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am). Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.  And at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a £1bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a £20bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.  In the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.  Then peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.  The sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.  There will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.  The Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's "engine room," followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.  Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.  She has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Lywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.  Then MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.  Labour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.  The day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).  In the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.  The really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.  There will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).  The Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.  This will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the "check-off" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.  The various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.  The Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.  Then MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.  The decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.  In the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on "pay to stay" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).  There will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.  The Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.  But the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.  His close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.  For the record, the current batting order is: Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).  There are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.  It's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35725862	Re-launch for 'people rating' app Peeple	Peeple, a controversial app that invites members to recommend others professionally, personally or as a date, is to launch in the US and Canada on Monday 7 March.  The app caused uproar when the idea was unveiled last year because people could be added and rated without their consent.  Now only members who have signed up will be visible on the site.  The idea of a "five star rating system" for individuals has also been dropped.  This will take the form of "recommendations" instead.  Co-founder Julia Cordray told the BBC that users of the app will also be able to control which recommendations appear on their profiles.  However, in April a premium service called The Truth License will enable those who choose the upgrade to see everything that has been said about other members, whether they have chosen to share those comments or not.  It is likely to cost around $1 (£0.70) a month, Ms Cordray said.  "We are going to hold everybody accountable to what they say about others," she said.  The outrage that greeted the unveiling of the app last autumn had taken the firm by surprise, she admitted.  It was branded "creepy" and "terrifying" by some web users.  "We could never have predicted the backlash to the concept," she said.  "But it was a positive thing because we ended up being able to give the people what they wanted."  Despite the media storm 10,000 people volunteered to beta-test it, Ms Cordray added.  The team made four main changes to the app's original functions:  Additionally, users who are single can opt to grey-out the "dating" category so they can neither make nor receive recommendations in that area.  Anonymity is not an option, users must use their Facebook log-in to access the app and they can be blocked or reported if they break the rules.  A pin code will also be sent to the mobile phone of new members as part of the activation process.  However, University of East Anglia law lecturer and privacy advocate Paul Bernal said he still had concerns about the re-launched app.  "It has solved some of the problems but very significant problems remain," he told the BBC.  "The fact that you can no longer rate people who aren't on it is probably the best thing they have done but it also means it's unlikely to succeed as it will be much more limited for the people who do join it.  "The idea of de-activating your profile is illusionary because the data is still there and vulnerable," he added.  "The Truth License over-rides almost all of their safeguards - if people say bad stuff about you that stuff could get out.  "I actually think calling it the Truth License is unbelievably creepy."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35724897	Decriminalise 'sex industry', says Jeremy Corbyn	Jeremy Corbyn has attracted criticism from Labour MPs for saying the "sex industry" should be decriminalised.  The Labour leader told students in London he wanted a society "where we don't automatically criminalise people", The Guardian reported.  Ex-Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman said prostitution was "exploitation and abuse" not "an industry".  Labour sources said Mr Corbyn had been answering a direct question, not making a policy announcement.  They added that he believed sex workers should not be seen as criminals.  The Labour leader had been taking part in a question and answer session at Goldsmiths University, in London, on Thursday.  According to the Guardian, he said: "I am in favour of decriminalising the sex industry. I don't want people to be criminalised. I want to be [in] a society where we don't automatically criminalise people.  "Let's do things a bit differently and in a bit more civilised way."  In 2014, Northern Ireland became the first part of the UK to pass legislation making the purchase of sexual services illegal.  In the rest of the UK, paying for sex is not against the law but many activities linked to it, such as brothel-keeping, kerb-crawling and soliciting sex in a public place, are outlawed.  "Man says we should decriminalize a known violence against women. Why did it have to be this man," she wrote.  But the English Collective of Prostitutes, which campaigns for decriminalisation, voiced its support for Mr Corbyn's comments.  Supporters of decriminalisation include Amnesty International, which says it would mean sex workers are "no longer forced to live outside the law".  Ms Harman tweeted: "Prostitution's exploitation and abuse not "work/an industry". Women should be protected and men prosecuted."  An attempt by former Labour Home Office minister Fiona Mactaggart to change the law to criminalise paying for sex was defeated in 2014.  Sex workers had criticised the proposal, saying criminalising their clients will make their work more dangerous.	politics

The FBI has ordered the tech giant to assist it with unlocking an iPhone used by San Bernadino gunman Syed Farook.  Prince Al Hussein said the law enforcement agency "deserves everyone's full support" in its investigation.  However, encryption was essential in the interests of freedom, he added.  "There are many ways to investigate whether or not these killers had accomplices besides forcing Apple to create software to undermine the security features of their own phones," he said in a statement.  "It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers.  "Encryption and anonymity are needed as enablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy. Without encryption tools, lives may be endangered."  The FBI has asked Apple to disable a feature that means the data on an iPhone is erased after 10 incorrect attempts at the four-digit password. It also wants to be able to run software that could go through the 100,000 possible combinations to unlock the gunman's handset quickly.  Apple says agreeing to the request would set "a dangerous precedent".  A number of major tech firms have also pledged their support for Apple's refusal to circumvent its own security.  Two groups of tech giants have now filed an amicus brief, which allows parties not directly involved in a court case, but who feel they are affected by it, to give their view.  However, a lawyer representing a group of Farook's surviving victims said he would file similar legal paperwork on their behalf in support of the FBI.  "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," said Stephen Larson, a former judge.  He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-34209149	VR on Macs when Apple makes a 'good computer'	The Rift headset will be available on Mac machines when Apple releases a "good computer," said the founder of the Oculus virtual reality firm.  In an interview, Palmer Luckey said currently no single Apple computer met the minimum specifications for the Rift.  The problem lay in the fact that Apple did not prioritise powerful graphics hardware, he added.  By contrast, HTC said its headset would work with Apple machines at launch.  Questioned at a Microsoft Xbox press event, Mr Luckey said support for the Oculus Rift headset on Macs depended on the way Apple built its machines.  "If they ever release a good computer, we will do it," he said.  "It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritise high-end GPUs," he told the Shack News site. The Rift, and other headsets, typically require the computer to which they are connected to possess a powerful graphics card or GPU. Buying or building a machine to support the Rift has been estimated to cost about £1,000 ($1,500).  Some research suggests that fewer than 1% of the world's PCs are running hardware that can support VR headsets.  "You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top-of-the-line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs," he said, adding that the company would "love" to support Mac machines.  Apple has not responded to Mr Luckey's criticism.  In May last year, Oculus "paused" development of support for Mac and Linux computers in favour of getting everything ready for machines running Windows.  Oculus's stance is at odds with HTC which has said that its Vive headset would work with Linux and Mac machines from "day one". However, a VR testing tool released by HTC partner Valve last week currently only works on Windows.  The Oculus Rift headset is scheduled for release on 28 March and the HTC Vive headset will start shipping soon after on 5 April.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35724722	E-book seller Nook pulls out of UK	Barnes & Noble, the US bookseller behind the e-book brand Nook, has announced it will cease selling digital books in the UK on 15 March.  Many British Nook owners received the news on World Book Day.  The UK versions of the online book shop, Android app and store accessed via Nook devices will all close.  Barnes & Noble said it is teaming up with supermarket giant Sainsbury's to ensure that customers can still access content they have already paid for.  "We thank you for your patronage and are working closely with Sainsbury's to make this transition as smooth as possible," it said in a statement to customers.  Customers must take action by the end of May in order to retain purchased content, it added, with instructions to follow by email.  Nook was launched in the UK in 2012 but the market continues to be dominated by Amazon's Kindle, said analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight.  "It's pretty tragic - it shows that Amazon is the powerhouse in the e-book market despite the best efforts of everybody else," he told the BBC.  "But it's a sensible move - if it's clear that the growth opportunity doesn't exist, it's better to pull out of the market than keep flogging a dead horse."  In its last quarterly results, released this week, the US company said overall sales were down by 1.8% but its net profit had increased by around £5.7m ($8m) year on year.  British Nook owner Tim Glenton, from Suffolk, said he had taken advantage of a special offer to purchase a Nook device but regularly used a Kindle.  "It's a shame there's a lack of competition in the market but it's not going to massively change my life," he said of the news.  "Nook never really quite took off in UK."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35720064	Home Office urged by MPs to get a grip on e-borders	The Home Office has been told by MPs to get a grip on a scheme to secure the UK's borders, which is set to be at least eight years late and cost £1bn.  The e-borders scheme, launched in 2003, has been dogged by problems and in 2014 was "terminated" in its current form.  The Public Accounts Committee accused officials of complacency and said delays in implementing its successor risked undermining Britain's security.  The Home Office said it was considering the report's findings.  The e-borders scheme is designed to enhance checks on people entering the country by air, rail and sea by gathering and processing data on passengers before they reach the border.  The cross-party committee said the new system was not expected to be in place until "at least" eight years later than planned and cost "significantly more than expected".  It found that repeated warnings about the original e-borders scheme and its successor had not been taken seriously, saying officials had been "worryingly dismissive".  "It is difficult to understand where this confidence comes from, given the lengthy delays and continual warnings of ongoing management issues, which gives us cause for concern about the future prospects for this programme which is vital to national security," its report said.  Seven warnings about the programme had been issued by the Major Projects Authority since 2010 and in 2015 the National Audit Office said checks remained "highly manual and inefficient" and the IT systems were outdated.  The report found that only 86% of those coming to Britain have their data checked ahead of travel, despite a pledge to carry this out on 95% of travellers by December 2010.  Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: "If the Home Office is to complete this project before the decade is out, then it must get its house in order now - starting by setting out exactly what it expects to achieve this year, and who will be held to account for it."  The Home Office said it would respond to the report "in due course".  A spokesman for the department said defending the UK's borders was its "top priority" and "we are investing heavily in our systems to tackle the threat from terrorism, organised crime and illegal immigration".  "Every passenger crossing our control points into the UK is checked against a range of watch-lists and the UK passport is among the most secure in the world.

Mr Jenas was responding to a question which asked whether the top rate of income tax should be lowered further after the George Osborne claimed the government received £8bn more in taxes after the cut to 45p.  The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the figures were refuted by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, with the increase coming from high earners delaying tax payments until after the rate cut.	politics

That's when Nick Harvey examined it more closely. It looked odd. And it was then that he saw the message.  His smart phone had, in effect, been hijacked and he was being asked to pay a ransom.  "My device had been locked", he told BBC Radio 4's PM Programme.  He was being instructed "to send some money via a voucher code to get the phone unlocked".  Ken Main knows how Nick felt. It happened to him with the computers at his hairdressing salon in Glasgow.  "It was a pale blue screen with the message right in the middle," he explained. "If we wanted the information back we would have to pay a ransom."  They had both become victims of what is known as ransomware - a type of computer virus which unlocks the users out of their computers or phones and demands money for the return of the files.  "It's like somebody breaking into your house", Ken said." It was a message which kind of created the same sort of emotional fear and then you start thinking 'God, what happens if I can't get this information back?'"  You are probably now trying to guess how much Ken and Nick were being asked to pay. It is possibly quite a lot lower than you would think.  "They asked me for $50 or €50" Nick recalled.  For Ken it was slightly more.  "They were looking for a ransom of $350 initially," he said. "When we contacted them by email, they put that up to €1000."  The demands are set at what is regarded as a payable level, according to Jornt van der Wiel from the security software company, Kaspersky Lab.  They tend to be for "the amount of money that people are still willing to pay in order to get their files back."  He explained, for a small business, "Sometimes it's cheaper for the company just to pay the ransom than to put back the backup because that in the end costs more".  Nick Harvey did not have to part with any money. He managed to get his phone working again although he did lose some data. Ken, however, felt he had no choice but to pay up.  "I said, 'Well I need that bloody information back. I've got a business to run here.' I think any businessman in my position would say 'Yes! Let's do it', because I've got no other way of getting information to rebuild that database."  According to Mr van der Wiel, ransomware can enter your computer via malicious email attachments. His advice is not to open any file which you are suspicious about. He says there can also be a problem if the latest "security patches" on your internet browser have not been installed.  Such are the difficulties that a ransomware attack can create; even those responsible for enforcing the law have given into the criminals.  When the systems at the police department in Tewksbury, Massachusetts, were affected, computer experts tried everything but to no avail.  "We couldn't restore it from an external back-up" Chief Timothy Sheehan said "because that was also corrupted and the taped back-up we had was at least 18 months old. We realised we were in a perfect storm. We were in a very bad situation."  The police department paid the ransom via a third party.  "Ultimately we decided that in our particular situation we should take the shot of paying the 500 dollars in bitcoin and see if we got the decryption key returned to us and we could return all of the data that was encrypted back to its normal status."  Chief Sheehan conceded that it meant paying money to criminals and he now wants to highlight the threat ransomware poses.  According to Raj Samani, Intel Security's chief technology officer in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, those behind ransomware are making hundreds of millions of dollars. He said there has been "enormous growth in ransomware certainly over the last 12 months".  He believes people in the UK are particularly vulnerable. There are many different types of ransomware viruses but according to Mr Samani "in almost every single type we look at, the UK is either second or third on that list, so I would argue that the UK is targeted disproportionately with regards to the number of internet users that we have."  Security experts have found ways of unlocking some forms of ransomware but those behind the cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated viruses too.  Back in the hairdressers in Glasgow, Ken Main has no regrets about paying the ransom. However, it didn't solve all his problems. Do not think paying up means all will end well.  "I would say 80 to 90% of the information was corrupted" he said. "In terms of hard cash income I would say we were probably down by about £20,000."	tech

Big banks must "serve the economy not just themselves", the Labour leader told the British Chambers of Commerce.  He also set out his vision for a "new economics", including borrowing to invest in infrastructure and skills.  He said Labour and business should be "natural allies", but warned that firms would need to "put more back into the economy" if it was in power.  Labour has been accused of being anti-business and lacking economic credibility - both under previous leader Ed Miliband's stewardship and now under Mr Corbyn.  Mr Corbyn was addressing the annual conference of the British Chambers of Commerce for the first time as Leader of the Opposition.  He used his speech to accuse the banking sector of letting down small businesses and consumers and said the banks "drove the economy to the point of collapse" in 2007 and 2008.  The Labour said the political consensus at the time was for "light touch" banking regulation "and sit back and collect the tax revenues".  "But you cannot base a decent social policy on an unsustainable economic policy and we cannot outsource economic policy to the City of London," he said, adding: "That has not served our economy well, and it has not served businesses well."  "The banking sector has to be reformed. Finance must support the economy, not be an extractive industry treating consumers, entrepreneurs and businesses as cash cows," he argued.  Mr Corbyn said a "new ecology of finance" was needed, with more support for credit unions and small businesses.  He called for a national investment bank to target investment "on key public and economic priorities, not just for very quick returns", and "we need to reform the major banks so that they serve the economy not just themselves".  Mr Corbyn also attacked the economic approach pursued by the government, saying the UK economy was "built on sand".  Labour wanted to "break with the failed economic orthodoxy" that had "gripped policy makers for a generation", and prioritise investment.  "We will borrow to invest over a business cycle. We will put public investment in science, technology and green industries of the future front and centre stage," he said.  Setting out his vision, he added: "Only an economy that is run for wealth creators - the technicians, entrepreneurs, designers, shopfloor workers, and the self-employed - and puts in them in the driving seat is going to deliver prosperity for all."  He acknowledged businesses "may not like everything we say" but when it came to "big decisions on the economy, infrastructure, skills and investment, we are actually natural allies because Labour is committed to what is needed for business to expand and succeed".  But he added: "We expect businesses to put more back into the economy but we will do more to give the economy a stronger future."	politics

The virus is suspected to be linked to a large number of babies born with underdeveloped brains in Brazil.  In February, the World Health Organization declared the Zika virus a global public health emergency.  Google said its grant would help to raise awareness, reduce mosquito populations and support the development of vaccines.  "Today we have Google engineers working with Unicef to analyse data, to determine how to map and anticipate the virus," the company said in a blog post.  The firm's team of volunteers is designing open-source software that will be able to collate data, such as weather and travel information, to help predict how Zika may spread.  Google said it had also updated its search engine to display detailed information about Zika - available in 16 languages - for visitors to the US and other countries. The company is also working with popular YouTube channels in Latin America to produce information videos about the virus.  The World Health Organisation has identified the Zika virus as a serious global threat, in the same category of importance as Ebola.  But unlike Ebola, where aid organisations focused on getting "boots on the ground" to treat patients and prevent transmission, with Zika the attention is on understanding the virus' link with microcephaly.  Microcephaly is when a baby is born with an unusually small head, as the brain has not developed properly.	tech

Ercan Findikoglu is believed to have co-ordinated the attacks, which used mules to withdraw money from cash machines around the world.  US prosecutors said hack attacks on three payment processing companies aided the widespread theft.  The charges he faces carry a potential jail term of more than 50 years.  The gang won access to computer networks let them inflate balances and remove withdrawal limits on pre-paid debit cards.  Copied cards were then used to withdraw money via cash machines in a series of co-ordinated operations carried out between 2010 and 2013. In one attack in February 2013, the gang of mules working in New York withdrew more than $2.4m from 3,000 cash machines in an 11-hour period, said US prosecutors.  One operation by the gang went after cards issued by JP Morgan Chase that helped the American Red Cross raise money for disaster relief.  Findikoglu pleaded guilty to several different charges including "computer intrusion conspiracy" for leading the hacking spree.  "By hacking into the computer networks of global financial institutions, the defendant and his co-conspirators were able to wreak havoc with the worldwide financial system by simultaneously withdrawing tens of millions of dollars,'' said US attorney Robert Capers in a statement.  The charges faced by Findikoglu mean he could face a 50-year jail term. However, US prosecutors said a plea deal reached with him would mean he was incarcerated for between 11 and 15 years. He will be sentenced on 12 July.  Findikoglu was caught and arrested at Frankfurt airport in 2013, and fought extradition to the US for more than 18 months.	tech

The Crown Prosecution Service says adults should be charged if, for example, they make a profile in the name of a victim with fake information which could damage their reputation.  The guidelines also include advice on new crimes such as revenge pornography.  The CPS guidelines advise prosecutors on how to interpret existing laws.  A six-week consultation on the proposed changes has now started.  "It is vital that prosecutors consider the bigger picture when looking at evidence and examine both the online and offline behaviour pattern of the defendant," said director of public prosecutions Alison Saunders.  "Online abuse is cowardly and can be deeply upsetting to the victim."  Fake accounts and websites can be used by those posing as their victims to post embarrassing messages or pictures.  This "may amount to an offence, such as grossly offensive communication or harassment", the CPS said.  Imposters have set up false accounts to discredit former partners, and attract new ones - a practice known as Catfishing.  Fraudsters have also set up fake LinkedIn profiles, in an attempt to harvest the personal details of legitimate users.  Facebook estimated in 2012 that it had tens of millions of illegitimate accounts.  The CPS is advising its prosecutors to be prepared to charge under existing laws if a case falls into one of three categories:  However, the guidance also sets out less serious situations where prosecutions should be considered under a fourth category: where a false identity is used to post upsetting messages, including false information that could cause anxiety.  Ms Saunders said there must be a balance between prosecuting people for malicious communications and protecting free speech - and only "grossly offensive" material could lead to prosecution.  The CPS has said children should rarely be prosecuted, because of their lack of adult judgement.  Prosecutions for online activity could be brought under a number of laws, including the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, which created a new offence of revenge pornography to prosecute people who post sexual images of others online without permission.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35686613	WhatsApp to end Blackberry OS support	WhatsApp is to end support for a number of operating systems including Blackberry 10, Nokia Symbian S60 and Windows Phone 7.1.  The company said it wanted to focus development "on the mobile platforms the vast majority of people use".  Facebook-owned WhatsApp, which is used by a billion people worldwide, will stop working on the named operating systems by December 2016.  But it will still work on Blackberry's latest smartphone which runs Android.  Most of the operating systems that WhatsApp is dropping support for are legacy operating systems, which are no longer updated or installed on new devices.  The exception is Blackberry 10, which was launched in January 2013 and is still being developed by Blackberry.  However, the operating system has failed to gain traction with smartphone users and now accounts for less than 1% of the market.  There had been speculation that the handset-maker would wind down support for Blackberry 10 after it released a smartphone running Android, and closed its "Built for Blackberry" programme for app developers.  But the company told the BBC: "BlackBerry is committed to our BlackBerry 10 operating system, and we work closely with developers to create and deploy solutions to bring apps to our consumer and enterprise fans.  "While the app landscape continues to evolve, our commitment to BlackBerry 10 and our developers is unwavering.  "We are actively exploring alternatives for BlackBerry users once support of WhatsApp Messenger for BBOS and BlackBerry 10 ends in late 2016."  The full list of operating systems WhatsApp will stop supporting is:  "While these mobile devices have been an important part of our story, they don't offer the kind of capabilities we need to expand our app's features in the future," WhatsApp said in a blogpost.  "When we started WhatsApp in 2009... about 70 percent of smartphones sold at the time had operating systems offered by BlackBerry and Nokia."  The firm said mobile operating systems offered by Google, Apple and Microsoft accounted for 99.5% of sales today.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35709680	Inside Medium: an attempt to bring civility to the internet	On an internet full of hurried, scruffy ballpoints, Medium is the web's fountain pen.  We're told our attention spans are short. That we cannot focus on anything beyond 140 characters, or without lists accentuated by quirky reaction gifs.  And yet Medium somehow manages to fend off this trend - encouraging the construction of a coherent argument via, primarily, long-form writing. The site is not built to reward clicks, but reads - and in doing so has fostered a different kind of community. It's almost… nice.  Almost entirely organically, Medium has become an outlet for people who already have the biggest audiences in the world. Think Bill Gates, Bono and even President Obama, who posted his State of the Union address on Medium, in full, before he delivered it to Congress.  And when a high-flying Amazon exec wanted to reignite a spat with the New York Times, he did so on Medium — despite Amazon's owner, Jeff Bezos, owning the legendary Washington Post. The Times, incidentally, responded on Medium.  "What we're trying to do is create the default place to write and publish anything of substance that you want the world to see," says Evan Williams, Medium's founder and chief executive.  Williams' office, just off San Francisco's Market Street, overlooks a city full of people desperately seeking the next idea that makes it big.  Williams has had three.  First, Blogger - a platform, eventually bought by Google, that was largely responsible for bringing us the verb "to blog".  Then came Twitter, which he co-founded in 2006 along with with Jack Dorsey, Biz Stone and Noah Glass. It's a site that has become synonymous with everything that is good, bad, hilarious and miserable on the web. Its verb - "to tweet".  Medium doesn't have a verb, yet. But it is going places. At the tail-end of 2015, more than two million posts had been published - a feat that's only impressive when you consider Medium posts, on the whole, are long. Some data digging by the company concluded that a post that takes seven minutes to read gathers the most attention.  On the internet, seven minutes is eons.  "The truth is people still read," Williams tells me. "All day long."  Right now, people are reading about politics. Several of the Presidential candidates have a presence on Medium, seeing it as a way of sharing policy beyond what they can shout during television debates.  "There's a need for more substantive thought and commentary, from whoever has to offer it," Williams says.  "We're trying to raise the level of discourse and get out of the soundbite world, for people who really care about what's going on."  Much of that commentary comes from media organisations, many of which have flocked to Medium despite having substantial web properties of their own.  Medium helps this happen: as well as a personal profile, Medium offers the creation of Publications - curated spaces that resemble homepages rather than blogs. With these, the news business is finding a captive and enthusiastic audience on Medium.  Somewhat oddly, companies usually extremely guarded about their own editorial product are simply giving it away to Medium - though that's about to change.  "We're building monetisation into the product right now," says Williams, predicting a roll-out of the features within a month or so.  "We're not limiting ourselves to advertising," he says, stressing that Medium won't become a mess of banner ads but instead "sponsored" content.  "I also think there's a lot of potential for premium or subscription or even user-paid content. Some sort of paywall or membership."  While text will remain the focus, Williams is also thinking about expanding into other facets on online content - such as video, or podcasts.  Williams predicts, and is banking on, a time when it'll be largely pointless for media companies to build and maintain their own online spaces.  "I think publishers who are experimenting with Medium are seeing a world where it's not about having a website.  "There are not going to be tens of millions of websites that lots of people go to every day.  "If you're a quality journalist or content creator, I think you can find an audience, I think you can find engagement, and I think you can find money."  Last month, a story written in the Sarawak Report - one such publication hosted on Medium - detailed alleged corruption involving the Malaysian prime minister.  After Medium's legal team refused to remove the article in question, the Malaysian government forced at least some internet service providers to block the entire Medium network.  But other posts do come down.  It's a "cat and mouse" game, says Medium lawyer Alex Feerst - one where the company must keep on top of large amounts of spam and other nefarious posts.  Medium has started to develop machine-learning tools to alleviate some of the workload from a safety team that consists of just five people - two of them part-time.  What a machine can't determine, though, is what constitutes harassment. Here the team walks an almost impossible tightrope, one which Twitter already seems to be falling off as high-profile users flee.  "If someone feels that they have been a victim of something, and wants to come on Medium and expose that story, that has implications for the people that they name," explains Sarah Agudo, Medium's head of legal.  "We aren't in a position to be arbiters of what's the truth and what's right or not."  Feerst says the team discusses at length the implications of maintaining Medium as a "safe space" - a consequence of an internet that is changing.  "There was an era when people did the bare minimum and just said 'we're not taking it down, it all stays up'. That era in some ways is over, because doing the bare minimum is less than we're going to do.  "We are going to take things down that are unsafe, that are hate speech, that are harassment. It's not a legal obligation, it's an obligation to the ecosystem of the site."  But there's one massively important principle, Feerst stresses.  "You shouldn't necessarily be kept safe from other people challenging your ideas."  Then again, of all the places online, Medium can sometimes seem the least likely place to be confronted with a view different to your own.  In its bid to be the home of civil conversion online, the design team has implemented several mechanisms that greatly shape the discussion on the site.  Primarily, comments and reactions from people you already know -  say, because you follow them on Twitter - are given precedent over comments from people you're not connected with.  This results in huge swathes of posts that feel as though San Francisco techies are talking largely amongst themselves, about issues largely absent from realities beyond the US west coast.  "You should quit your job and do what you love!", the rich people queue up to write.  Medium knows this. And the design team is working on introducing dissenting, contrary views, while keeping things polite.  "We think about how can we help compliment your viewpoints," says Brad Simpson, product designer.  "One of the things I care a lot about is showing a spectrum of vantage points. So we can have a shared conversation."  One feature that helps is Highlights, a method in which commenters can make points about specific passages of text. In theory, this discourages visitors from rushing to the bottom of articles to declare, in a way that's pointlessly broad, that the piece is "a load of rubbish".  But the reputation Medium has gained as an echo-chamber for the tech elite - and insufferable self-help experts - could grow into an embarrassment for the network, as Williams is well aware.  "It's more diverse than people may realise," he says.  "Just like Twitter - it started in San Francicso among people that we knew because that's how networks grow, with early adopters.  "Is it where we want to get it? Not yet. We want it to be about everything of import."  It's impossible not to compare the emergence of Medium with the rise of Twitter.  Both found popularity thanks to excitable Silicon Valley-types; both are a platform designed for free and open discussion, even if that's not always possible; and both can thrust previously unknown people under the critical gaze of millions.  They share the same street and the same co-founder. Does Williams worry about the future of beleaguered Twitter?  "The core service is healthy, it provides something that nothing else does," Williams says.  "I think being [a public company] is challenging. The biggest problem is that we need to innovate on the product side. I'm optimistic that there are big things coming for Twitter."  I ask him bluntly: is Twitter for sale?  "No. The media swings these things in extremes," he says.  Maybe it does. Maybe I am. As we end our interview, I tell Williams, as many people apparently do, that I simply can't imagine an internet without Twitter humming in the background, providing the collective train of thought.  Could Medium some day come to be seen the same way? A vital internet utility, but without becoming a place too distressing for many to inhabit?  Few have done as much for free speech on the internet than Evan Williams - but even he must be daunted by what could lie ahead.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

The expert says it is possible to start the octocopter's engines, engage auto-takeoff, control its camera and, potentially, crash the machine.  He will present his findings at the RSA security conference in San Francisco, and has published a thesis.  The drone's manufacturer has been informed.  However, the researcher told Wired magazine there would be "no easy fix" to the problem, meaning units might have to be recalled for a hardware update.  Nils Rodday is currently a security consultant at IBM, but carried out his research at the Netherlands' University of Twente.  His work focused on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used by the Dutch police force for surveillance.  He said it cost about 20,000 euros ($21,700; £15,400).  It is more expensive than consumer drones because it:  The UAV is also used for power-line inspections, professional photography and agriculture applications  The aircraft's maker lent Mr Rodday a copy of its machine on condition its name was not disclosed.  Mr Rodday focused on its use of a telemetry module fitted with an Xbee radio chip, made by the company Digi International.  The module converts wi-fi commands sent by a computer app into low frequency radio waves, which are then transmitted to another Xbee chip on the drone.  This allows the operator to control it from a greater distance than would otherwise be possible.  To achieve the hack, Mr Rodday required two Xbee chips of his own, among other low-cost components, as well as the use of a computer.  The hack consisted of two parts:  The second step had been relatively easy, Mr Rodday said, because the drone-maker had opted not to make use of Xbee's built-in encryption features.  The reason for this was that they would have extended the lag between the operator sending a command and the drone reacting.  "The whole communication is sent in clear text," wrote Mr Rodday in his thesis.  "As long as the arriving data is syntactically and semantically correct, the data is forwarded to the application."  Countermeasures were possible to prevent such attacks, he added, but they would "require better hardware, which leads to increased production cost".  The drone manufacturer intends to fix the problem when it releases its next-generation model.  But Mr Rodday believes other similar high-end aircraft may also face the same issue.  To raise awareness, he intends to hack a drone on stage at the RSA.  "[I] will make the UAV engine's spin, so the UAV will have to be tied to something heavy during the presentation," he said.  Another expert, who has previously spoken out about the risks that drones pose, said he was concerned.  "That a engineering student could demonstrate how to hack and take control of a larger commercial UAV as part of his masters degree shows both the infancy of this technology and the potential risks presented by the proliferation of these devices," said Prof David Dunn, from the University of Birmingham.  "As this report shows, drones such as this can be commandeered [and] then be stolen, or redirected to crash into a specific target such as a crowd, building or airliner.  "This report, however, raises the more general issue of the risks presented by the development of a new technology, the use of which is way ahead of preparations to regulate, deter, or defend against its potentially malign uses."

It is looking into whether Facebook's "dominance" means those terms also constituted an abuse of market power. The formal probe is the first of its kind the social network has faced.  Facebook said it was confident it complied with the law.  "Dominant companies are subject to special obligations," said Andreas Mundt, the president of the cartel office.  "These include the use of adequate terms of service as far as these are relevant to the market  "For advertising-financed internet services such as Facebook, user data are hugely important.  "For this reason, it is essential to also examine under the aspect of abuse of market power whether the consumers are sufficiently informed about the type and extent of data collected."  His investigation would focus on Facebook's US operation, as well as its German and Irish subsidiaries, the cartel office said in a statement released on Wednesday.  It said Facebook was dominant in the social media market and relied on advertising revenues generated on the basis of a "large amount of personal user data".  And users had to agree to this collection of data as a condition of their being able to use the network.  "It is difficult for users to understand and assess the scope of the agreement accepted by them," it said.  "There is considerable doubt as to the admissibility of this procedure, in particular under applicable national data protection law.  "If there is a connection between such an infringement and market dominance, this could also constitute an abusive practice under competition law."  A Facebook representative said: "We are confident that we comply with the law, and we look forward to working with the Federal Cartel Office to answer their questions."  The German authorities are working in "close contact" with the European Commission, the competition authorities of the other EU member states and data and consumer protection officers.  European Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said the EU executive shared the view of the German cartel office that the mere infringement of data protection rules by a dominant company did not automatically amount to a competition violation.  "However, it cannot be excluded that a behaviour that violates data protection rules could also be relevant when investigating a possible violation of EU competition rules," he added, while declining specific comment on the new case.  Speaking in Germany in January, the European commissioner for competition Margrethe Vestager said her agency was taking a harder look at whether the collection of vast amounts of consumer data by big internet companies violated competition rules.	tech

A Lords committee said it was time to reach a "fair settlement" on the "vexed" issue of party funding.  The Trade Union Bill would require members to opt in to, rather than opt out of, paying a levy to Labour, which fears it will lose £6m a year.  The government said peers had endorsed the plan for a union opt-in levy.  The Lords committee was set up to examine the Trade Union Bill proposals after peers defeated the government and backed a call by Labour - which opposes the plans - for further scrutiny.  Conservative and Lib Dem peers have also suggested the government should rethink its proposals.  The bill, which is going through Parliament, would require Labour-affiliated union members to "opt in" to paying a levy to the party instead of having it automatically deducted.  But the committee said the changes would hit union political funds in general, and Labour in particular - which is said to receive 20% of its core funding from unions.  Labour is also reported to be set to lose out on £1.3m a year when state funding for opposition parties - known as Short money - is cut.  The committee proposed several changes to the government's plans which, it said, would allow it to meet its manifesto pledges "while mitigating the worst impacts on the trade unions and the Labour Party".  The committee did not reach agreement on whether the new system should apply to existing union members.  But committee chairman Lord Burns said: "All members of the committee strongly backed the call for the government to convene cross-party talks as soon as possible, in order to reach a fair and long-lasting settlement to the vexed issue of party funding."  The report warned: "If any government were to use its majority unilaterally to inflict significant damage on the finances of opposition parties, it would risk starting a tit-for-tat conflict which could harm parliamentary democracy."  Responding its findings, employment minister Nick Boles said: "There might be differences of opinion about how and when this should be implemented, but the principle... that union members should make an active and transparent choice to contribute to political funds has been supported by the committee."  Labour's leader in the Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, hoped the recommendations would "pave the way for a fair, reasonable and lasting agreement on party funding".  She said nothing was being done to address "big donations" to the Tories and accused the government of a "partisan attack on Labour and the trade unions, and by extension democracy itself".  Meanwhile, TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said union money "is the most transparent in politics" and the public were more concerned about the influence of the wealthy on politics.  The Electoral Reform Society said welcomed the call for talks on party funding, saying the public wanted to see "real reform" of parties' finances.	politics

The call-back affects adapters used to make the chargers work with UK and Republic of Ireland plug sockets.  It says the affected kit was included with 7in-display Fire and Fire Kids Edition tablets sold since September 2015.  It is the latest in a series of tech companies to announce such a move.  Apple recalled power charger adapter plugs of its own in January, and Microsoft withdrew power cords for its Surface Pro tablets the following month.  Amazon has advised its customer to charge their tablets via a USB cable attached to a PC while they wait for replacement parts.  "Customer safety is our top priority, and we are proactively offering to replace these power adapters with a new adapter, free of charge," it said in a statement.  "Power adapters sold in other countries and power adapters shipped with Fire HD and Fire HDX tablets are not affected and need not be exchanged."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35706730	'Thousands of popular sites' at risk of Drown hack attacks	Websites have been warned they could be exposed to eavesdroppers, after researchers discovered a new way to disable their encryption protections.  The experts said about a third of all computer servers using the HTTPS protocol - often represented by a padlock in web browsers - were vulnerable to so-called Drown attacks.  They warn that passwords, credit card numbers, emails and sensitive documents could all be stolen as a consequence.  But it will take some time for many of the website administrators to protect their systems.  The researchers have released a tool that identifies websites that appear to be vulnerable.  They said they had not released the code used to prove their theory because "there are still too many servers vulnerable to the attack".  As yet, there is no evidence hackers have worked out how to replicate their technique.  An independent expert said he had no doubt the problem was real.  "What is shocking about this is that they have found a way to use a very old fault that we have known about since 1998," said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey.  "And all this was perfectly avoidable.  "It is a result of us having used deliberately weakened encryption, which people broke years ago, and it is now coming back to haunt us."  The researchers, cybersecurity experts from universities in Israel, Germany and the US as well as a member of Google's security team, found a computer server could be vulnerable to attack just by supporting 1990s-era encryption protocol SSLv2 (Secure Sockets Layer version 2), even if in day-to-day use it employed more modern encryption standards to scramble communications.  In practice, older email servers would be more likely to have this problem than the newer computers typically used to power websites.  But because many organisations reuse encryption certificates and keys between the two sets of servers.  The researchers dubbed the flaw Drown - an acronym for decrypting the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) algorithm with obsolete and weakened encryption.  "Operators of vulnerable servers need to take action," they wrote.  "There is nothing practical that browsers or end-users can do on their own to protect against this attack."  The SSLv2 protocol was deliberately weakened because, at the time of its creation, the US government wanted to try to restrict the availability of tough encryption standards to other countries.  It has since eased its export limits, but the effects live on.  "The problem is that while clients - such as [web] browsers - have done away with SSLv2, many servers still support the protocol," blogged Prof Matthew Green, from Johns Hopkins University.  "In most cases this is the result of careless server configuration.  "In others, the blame lies with crummy and obsolete embedded devices that haven't seen a software update in years - and probably never will. "  To mount a successful attack on a website would still require a considerable amount of computational force.  But, the researchers said, under normal circumstance, hackers could rent the required capacity from Amazon's cloud compute division for as little as $440 (£314).  In addition, because many of the servers vulnerable to Drown were also affected by a separate bug, a successful attack could be carried out using a home computer.  "This form of the attack is fast enough to allow an online man-in-the-middle style of attack, where the attacker can impersonate a vulnerable server to the victim," the researchers wrote.  "We were able to execute this form of the attack in under a minute on a single PC."  The researchers said many popular sites - including ones belonging to Samsung, Yahoo and a leading Indian bank - appeared to be vulnerable.  Prof Woodward said the team's test had also indicated a problem with bbc.co.uk.  "The weakness is actually in the old Pop3 server," he said.  "Few people still use Pop3, but it means that things like your password reset server could theoretically be eavesdropped upon."  Read more from our Cybersecurity Alert special index	tech

Pointing to a National Audit Office report, he said a third of families would not now receive it.  David Cameron said the report also said "significant progress" had been made.  He said tax-free childcare changes - also highlighted by Mr Corbyn - had been delayed by two court cases, at Prime Minister's Questions.  Mr Cameron said the new scheme - which was meant to be launched in Autumn 2015 - would now be introduced in 2017.  On the promise to deliver 30 hours of free childcare a week, Mr Cameron said pilot schemes would be launched this year, followed by "full implementation" in 2017.  Mr Corbyn said: "One third of families promised 30 hours of free childcare now won't receive it. This is a broken promise.  "The NAO report also warns that many childcare providers are not offering the new entitlement due to insufficient funding.  "There are 41,000 three-year-olds missing out on free early education as a result of this. Will the prime minister intervene and ensure those children get the start in life they deserve?"  Mr Cameron quoted the NAO report as saying the government had "successfully implemented" the entitlement with "almost universal" take-up of hours offered, with parents and children "clearly benefiting" and providers "positive" about increasing it to 30 hours.  He then made a jibe about Labour's new economic adviser "one Mr Yanis Varoufakis".  "He was the Greek finance minister who left his economy in ruins.  "That is Labour's policy in two words - 'Acropolis now'."  Mr Corbyn said that would not help the thousands of children who were missing out on the free childcare promised by the government.  He then accused the Mr Cameron of presiding over a "crisis" in teacher recruitment and classroom overcrowding - both points denied by Mr Cameron, who said there were "453 fewer schools that were full or over capacity compared to 2010".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35706510	Can a British tech firm turn AR into (augmented) reality?	We've heard a lot lately about virtual reality and the promise of a 360 degree view of the world.  Only yesterday I got an intriguing VR demo from the Philharmonia Orchestra which placed me right in front of the conductor, able to look around and see and hear the different sections playing some Sibelius.  But an announcement from a British technology firm on Wednesday signals that it is AR - augmented reality - rather than VR which may have more immediate commercial potential.  Blippar, whose technology uses smartphone cameras to overlay information on the real world, has revealed that it has received £38.6m in new funding.  The cash comes mainly from the Malaysian government's strategic investment fund, and brings the total investment in the company to more than £71.5m, making it one of the UK's best-funded tech start-ups.  Blippar has found a lucrative use for AR by offering leading brands new ways to connect with consumers. Point its app at a Coke can, for instance, and it may play you a tune from Spotify.  When I caught up with the co-founder and chief executive Ambarish Mitra, he told me he thought AR was likely to catch on far more quickly than VR because billions of people already used phones with cameras, whereas virtual reality headsets would not be common for a while. He quoted research predicting that the combined VR/AR market would be worth $150bn (£107bn) by 2020 - but that AR would account for $120bn (£86bn) of that.  But Mitra has far greater ambitions for his technology than employing it as a gimmicky advertising technique. He wants to create what he calls a visual search engine for the world and he's going to put some of the new funds into Blippar's artificial intelligence teams which are already at work in Silicon Valley and London on this project.  So far, he says, they've developed something with "the visual brain of a six-year-old - and six-year-olds can recognise most things in the world". Show it a fruit and it can say that's an apple or an orange, point it at St Paul's Cathedral and it will know that it's a church.  But within a year he hopes that it will have grown into an 18-year-old: "It will go into far more narrow definitions, it will tell you when St Paul's was built, who got married there, everything associated with it." And eventually, he says, the Blippar AI/AR technology will be smarter at seeing the world and understanding it than any human.  Make no mistake - this is a really ambitious venture. Getting computers to index the world is one thing, but cognition - getting them to understand it - is quite another. But will this visual search engine be both useful and commercially valuable?  Mitra believes that millions of phone users around the world - particularly those with poor language skills - are ready to use the cameras on their phones to search for information. He says his free app has seen huge growth in usage in the last six months, and is ready to hit the mainstream.  Predicting the way consumers will adopt any new technology is hard - just look at Google Glass, which seemed to show that augmented reality was far from ready for mainstream use. But Blippar now has backers with deep pockets in both Asia and the United States, and that gives it time to turn its ambitious vision into reality.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35698852	Farm cash delays blamed on 'childish turf war' in Whitehall	Unacceptable behaviour and rows between Whitehall officials have been blamed for delays in subsidies being paid to farmers in England.  The Public Accounts Committee said the Common Agricultural Policy delivery project was beset by a "childish turf war" at cash-strapped farmers' expense.  MPs said the "fiasco" could cost taxpayers hundreds of millions in spiralling costs and EU penalties.  The government said nearly all farmers would be paid by the end of the month.  A spokesman for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said "the collective focus has always remained on getting payments out to farmers as quickly as possible".  But in a highly critical report published on Wednesday, the cross-party committee found that "repeated failures" meant "many farmers are paid later than in previous years... at a time when they are already suffering financially."  Under the CAP, which is an EU system of subsidies for farmers, about 105,000 payments totalling £1.8bn are paid to English farmers and landowners each year.  But the Public Accounts Committee said the three bodies responsible for handing over the money to UK farmers - the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Rural Payments Agency and the Government Digital Service - had been unable to work together effectively.  "Dysfunctional and inappropriate behaviours amongst senior leaders were inexcusable and deeply damaging to the programme... potentially costing the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds in financial penalties," it said.  "Highly paid public servants need to get the job done and such behaviour is unacceptable," the report added.  The report said only 38% of payments were made under the Basic Payment Scheme on 1 December 2015 - compared with more than 90% in previous years.  It said in addition to the delayed payments, the cost of the programme had risen by 40% to £215m and penalties from the European Commission were "likely to increase further".  The report also criticised the Government Digital Service's focus on developing an online application system, saying it was "inappropriate for farmers, who have a lower average level of digital literacy", and given the "poor broadband coverage in many rural areas".  In March 2015 online applications were replaced by a "paper-assisted digital system" following repeated IT failures.  The committee concluded that the department should "review its approach to tackling serious failures of management" to ensure it cannot happen again.  It also called for "clear milestones" for when the department expects to pay farmers in future.  Meg Hillier, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, said: "This programme was set up to deliver support to UK farmers. Instead, it delivered an appalling Whitehall fiasco."  She added: "The enduring mental image is of managers, having seemingly lost sight of the purpose of the project, devoting their energies to a childish turf war instead.  "If the department is to build trust in this programme and other projects it first needs to rebuild trust with farmers."  A spokesman for the department said aside from the IT issues in March 2015 "the core of the system has always worked".  "Over 87,000 farmers registered on the system and it has been used to process and pay over 70,800 farmers - over 80% of all those eligible - their 2015 Basic Payment Scheme payment, totalling £1.11bn.  "Almost all farmers in England will be paid by the end of this month and the Rural Payments system has been further improved for 2016 to make it easier for farmers to apply for CAP payments," the spokesman added.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35689429	EU referendum: Polls suggest economy is key battleground	Just as we approach the 2016 referendum on Britain's membership of the EU with the polling industry in disarray, following its car crash in 2015, so were the polls in the 1975 European referendum burdened with past failures.  In the 1970 general election, all bar one had predicted the wrong result and their performance in the two 1974 general elections was charitably described as "unhappy".  Why then should we be interested in the latest poll published in the British Social Attitudes (BSA) series? The answer is that here we are dealing with the quality end of polling.  The underperforming polls in the 2015 general election were conducted quickly over a few days and by telephone or via the internet. The BSA poll on attitudes to Europe was conducted face-to-face with 3,000 respondents between July and early November 2015.  Professor John Curtice, who presents the findings, is also able to draw on a great treasury of past data that the BSA has accumulated in its annual surveys stretching back three decades.  The survey suggests that 60% favoured continuing EU membership, compared with 30% who favoured withdrawal. A strong lead, but half the 60% lead for staying registered in 1991. And support for remaining is not unqualified: the survey also found that 43% preferred a looser relationship with the EU than at present - a view shared by 43% of Scots as well.  What are the main pressure points in our current relationship with the EU? The BSA highlights four from the evidence they have gathered:  The survey also suggests that there is also a deeper issue at play in all this. When asked 'How much do you agree or disagree that being a member of the European Union is undermining Britain's distinctive identity?' some 47% agreed, compared with 30% who disagreed.  For many concerned about our national identity, the issue of EU migrants plays an important part in their judgement; 57% of respondents believed immigration would be lower if Britain did leave the EU.  Much of this would seem to offer very fertile territory for those advocating the UK's departure from the European Union. However, this is where things begin to get more complicated. In the face of these significant concerns, why do the same respondents give a 30-point majority to continuing membership? It seems clear that even large dollops of scepticism are not sufficient to persuade enough people that Britain should actually leave the EU.  The missing ingredient in all this appears to be the economy. As the report states: "For scepticism to translate into support for withdrawal, voters need also to be convinced of the economic case for leaving. And at present most are not."  Indeed, only 24% believe that Britain's economy would be better off if Britain left the EU, while as many as 40% feel it would be worse off.  It seems to me that the real battleground in the 2016 EU referendum campaign, the territory where the battle will be won or lost, is to be found in two key statistics identified in the report.  It says: "Only two in five (40%) of those who believe that the EU is undermining Britain's identity but who are not convinced that the economy would be better say that they wish to withdraw from the EU. But that figure is at least double (82%) amongst those whose cultural concern is married with a belief in the economic benefits of withdrawal."  Concerns about the future of the economy played a significant part in the 1975 European referendum as well. In 2016, it seems it may be another case of déjà vu all over again. For scepticism to translate into support for withdrawal, voters need also to be convinced of the economic case for leaving. And at present most are not.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35659152	How did governments lose control of encryption?	The clash between Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.  Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called "Crypto Wars".  Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the BBC World Service Inquiry programme about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI.  "The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East.  "They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element?  "The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes.  "Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command.  "They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever.  "But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications.  "That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it.  "[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market."  Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  "Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful.  "The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom.  "There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government.  "The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction.  "Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge.  "But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly.  "Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home.  "But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies.  "It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure.  "The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government.  "Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad.  "In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle."  Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles.  "Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side.  "In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message.  "You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since.  "It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called the Tor network which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with.  "Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted.  "They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used. They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies.  "They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Coffee, which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems.  "You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form.  "All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out."  Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013.  "I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies.  "When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic.  "The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies.  "They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption.  "So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort.  "Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet.  "I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret.  "Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that.  "The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy.  "I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent. What I would say is I like that this fight is happening in public so that we can have debates like this."  The Inquiry is broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35639549	Is your smartphone listening to you?	It all began with a car crash.  I was doing some ironing when my mum came in to tell me that a family friend had been killed in a road accident in Thailand.  My phone was on the worktop behind me.  But the next time I used the search engine on it, up popped the name of our friend, and the words, "Motorbike accident, Thailand" and the year in the suggested text below the search box.  I was startled, certain that I had not used my phone at the time I had had the conversation - my hands had been full.  Had I started to look the details up later on and forgotten? Or was my phone listening in?  Almost every time I mentioned it to people they had a similar story, mainly based around advertising.  One friend complained to her boyfriend about a migraine, her first ever, only to find the next day she was being followed on Twitter by a migraine support group.  Another had an in-depth chat with her sister about a tax issue, and the next day was served up a Facebook advert from tax experts offering advice on that exact issue.  Many said they were discussing particular products or holiday destinations and shortly afterwards noticed advertising on the same theme.  One reporter mentioned his male colleague seeing online adverts for sanitary pads after discussing periods with his wife in the car.  But surely if the microphone was activated and the handset was sending data, battery life would be even worse than it is now and individual data usage would be through the roof?  I challenged cybersecurity expert Ken Munro and his colleague David Lodge from Pen Test Partners to see whether it was physically possible for an app to snoop in this way.  Could something "listen in" at will without it being obvious?  "I wasn't convinced at first, it all seemed a bit anecdotal," admitted Mr Munro.  However, to our collective surprise, the answer was a resounding yes.  They created a prototype app, we started chatting in the vicinity of the phone it was on and watched our words appear on a laptop screen nearby.  "All we did was use the existing functionality of Google Android - we chose it because it was a little easier for us to develop in," said Mr Munro.  "We gave ourselves permission to use the microphone on the phone, set up a listening server on the internet, and everything that microphone heard on that phone, wherever it was in the world, came to us and we could then have sent back customised ads."  The whole thing took a couple of days to build.  It wasn't perfect but it was practically in real time and certainly able to identify most keywords.  The battery drain during our experiments was minimal and, using wi-fi, there was no data plan spike.  "We re-used a lot of code that's already out there," said David Lodge.  "Certainly the user wouldn't realise what was happening. As for Apple and Google - they could see it, they could find it and they could stop it. But it is pretty easy to create."  "I'm not so cynical now," said Ken Munro.  "We have proved it can be done, it works, we've done it. Does it happen? Probably."  The major tech firms absolutely reject such an idea.  Google said it "categorically" does not use what it calls "utterances" - the background sounds before a person says, "OK Google" to activate the voice recognition - for advertising or any other purpose. It also said it does not share audio acquired in that way with third parties.  Its listening abilities only extend to activating its voice services, a spokesperson said.  It also states in its content policy for app developers that apps must not collect information without the user's knowledge. Apps found to be breaking this are removed from the Google Play store.  Facebook also told the BBC it does not allow brands to target advertising based around microphone data and it never shares data with third parties without consent.  It said Facebook ads are based only around information shared by members on the social network and their net surfing habits elsewhere.  Other big tech companies have also denied using the technique.  There is of course also a more mathematical explanation - the possibility that there is really no connection at all between what we say and what we see.  Mathematics professor David Hand from Imperial College London wrote a book called The Improbability Principle, in which he argued that apparently extraordinary events happen all the time.  "We are evolutionarily trained to seek explanations," he told the BBC.  "If you see a sign you know is associated with a predator you run away and you survive.  "It's the same sort of thing here. This apparent coincidence occurs and we think there must be explanation, it can't be chance. But there are so many opportunities for that coincidence to occur.  "If you take something that has a tiny chance of occurring and give it enough opportunities to occur, it inevitably will happen."  People are generally more alert to things that are currently occupying them, such as recent conversations or big decisions like buying a car or choosing a holiday, he added.  So suddenly those sorts of messages stand out more when they may have been in the background all the time.  Prof Hand is not immune to the lure of coincidence himself.  When his book was published another author published a very similar title at the same time. The author of The Coincidence Authority, John Ironmonger, shared the same birthday as Prof Hand and was based at the same university as his wife.  "These sorts of things happen," he said.  "Just because I understand why it happened doesn't make it any less beautiful."  Read more cybersecurity stories in our special index	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35700813	Bernard Jenkin 'reassured' after grilling civil service boss Sir Jeremy Heywood	A leading Conservative MP says he is satisfied with rules on civil servants helping anti EU ministers, after grilling Whitehall's top official.  Bernard Jenkin said he was "reassured" by Sir Jeremy Heywood's answers to his Commons committee.  Sir Jeremy told the MPs the ban only applies to "briefing and speech material supporting the Out position".  Out campaigners had criticised the move, with one minister calling the curbs "unconstitutional".  Also appearing before the Commons Public Administration Committee, the top civil servant in the Northern Ireland Office said the minister in charge of his department might have to use the Freedom of Information Act to get information.  The restrictions were put in place after David Cameron allowed his ministers to campaign on either side in the referendum to be held on 23 June.  The government's official position is to remain in the EU.  Sir Jeremy said officials had not been banned from supplying facts to ministers campaigning for an EU exit.  Mr Jenkin, who backs an EU exit, said he had been "reassured" by the cabinet secretary's answers - but his call for Sir Jeremy's original guidance, which had caused the row, to be withdrawn was rejected.  "It was made clear to us that whatever understandings existed before our meeting, it is now not the intention that any facts, information or papers relating to the referendum should be not withheld from dissenting ministers," Mr Jenkin said.  He added: "We do think that this contradicts the cabinet secretary's letter and the Q&A briefing subsequently issued... and we suggested it should be withdrawn and re-issued, but nevertheless we welcome this clarification."  The guidance said ministers opposing the official government position that Britain should remain the EU should not be given access to government papers on the referendum or the prime minister's EU renegotiations.  Asked to clarify what it meant in practice, the cabinet secretary said "pure facts" and statistics would not be withheld from ministers.  "If there is factual material that is generally available in the department - I would have discuss that with the prime minister - but I am pretty sure he would be comfortable about that being shared."  He added: "We are not going to deny ministers information they need to run their departments."  What officials would not be allowed to do would be write speeches, prepare "arguments to use" or "rebuttal points" for ministers to use in the campaign to leave the EU, Sir Jeremy told the committee.  The idea was to prevent ministers from using government resources "to attack the government", he said.  The cabinet secretary said the guidelines were based on those that were used in 1975, when the Labour cabinet was allowed to campaign on different sides in a referendum on whether to remain in the European Economic Community.  Sir Jeremy said he had been "surprised" by the anger the guidelines had caused, adding: "I don't think there is much to see here to be honest."  Earlier, Sir Jonathan Stephens, permanent secretary at the Northern Ireland Office, told the committee his boss, Theresa Villiers, might have to use the Freedom of Information Act to to get departmental information.  Ms Villiers is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU.  Asked whether he would withhold information from her which may have bearing on the referendum, he said: "Yes. That information is to be used to support the policy of the government of the day."  Ministers campaigning for an EU exit were "operating in a personal capacity and in that respect, if they put in a freedom of information request or a parliamentary question, that will be answered, but they won't be receiving the support of the civil service", added Sir John.  London mayor Boris Johnson, who is campaigning for Britain to leave the EU, has said it would be "obviously wrong" to prevent the public from accessing any information that might inform their decision in the forthcoming EU referendum.  He added: "If there's anything that impedes public access to information about a critical decision that they need to make in a few months' time, then that's obviously wrong."  Asked if Sir Jeremy's advice was unconstitutional, as has been suggested by employment minister Priti Patel, Mr Johnson said: My general view is that we should be as open and transparent as possible and the emphasis, if at all possible, should be to get the public all the information they need to make up their decision."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35698856	Reality Check: What trade benefits could UK keep if it left EU?	The UK's trading partnerships with other countries are governed by a complex set of agreements, which are all negotiated by European Union. Would the UK be able to carry on doing business globally as it does now if it left the EU?  Lord Lawson, former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer and chairman of the Vote Leave campaign group, thinks so.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One on Monday he said that if Britain left the EU: "First of all our trade relations with the rest of the world remain totally unchanged because the European Union did not negotiate as the European Union.  "It's not allowed to, it's not a member of the World Trade Organisation, it negotiated on behalf of the member states. So all our arrangements with the rest of the world remain totally unchanged."  On BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday, Lord Mandelson, a former EU trade commissioner who is campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, denied this was the case.  So who is right?  There are two types of trade agreement to consider: first, global or multilateral trade agreements done through the World Trade Organisation, the WTO.  In relation to membership of the WTO, Lord Lawson is right. The UK (and the other EU member states) are WTO members in their own right.  The UK is a founder member. The European Commission does negotiate on their behalf in the WTO, on the basis of a negotiating mandate from member states' trade ministers. However, contrary to what Lord Lawson said, the EU is also a member in its own right.  Experts we have consulted think the UK could expect full access to the markets of WTO members on the same terms as other members of the organisation. It is a basic principle of the WTO that trade policy is supposed to be non-discriminatory.  READ MORE: The truth behind claims in the EU debate  However there might be a complicated transition. The British government (which is seeking a Remain vote) put it like this: "In the event that we leave the EU, we would need to update the terms of our WTO membership where the commitments taken have previously applied to the EU as a whole.  "This would not be a straightforward process as, if we leave the EU, then we would need all other WTO members to agree how the UK will take on the rights and obligations which we have formerly taken as a part of the EU.  "This would mean negotiating and agreeing updated UK schedules of commitments with all 161 WTO members.  "And until our schedule of commitments was updated, there could be questions surrounding our rights to access WTO members' markets, and our ability to enforce those rights".  The transition might be somewhat simpler if the UK were to adopt the EU's tariffs and other policies on access to the UK market.  The EU has another group of trade agreements with countries that provide European exporters with better access to their markets - and better access for them to the EU.  There are such agreements with Korea, Mexico and Canada among others and the really big one is being negotiated with the US (the controversial Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership or TTIP).  It is true that these agreements generally list the member states (including the UK) as parties, but all the experts we have contacted say that negotiations will be required if these agreements are to continue providing enhanced market access for the UK business.  It would be open to the other countries to extend their agreements on the same terms to the UK. It would be a matter of their judgement of their own interests and negotiation with the UK. Britain is a large market, though not as large as the EU, so there is a clear incentive for these countries to negotiate.	politics

According to reports, Facebook's vice-president for Latin America, Diego Dzodan, was held for questioning in Sao Paulo on Tuesday.  Court officials in the Brazilian state of Sergipe requested his arrest.  Facebook said it was an "extreme and disproportionate measure".  "Facebook has always been and will be available to address any questions Brazilian authorities may have," the company said. It added that the arrest stemmed from a case involving its messaging service WhatsApp, which operates separately from the Facebook platform.  Federal police in Sao Paulo said they carried out an arrest warrant issued by a criminal judge from the Lagarto district, in Brazil's smallest state, Sergipe. A statement released by the force said Facebook had been ordered by a court to provide evidence that would aid an investigation into "organised crime and drug trafficking" that was being heard in private.  The Reuters news agency reported that court officials in Sergipe also confirmed the detention of Diego Dzodan.  A source told the BBC that the Facebook office in Brazil deals only in sales and said that no-one there had access to WhatsApp user information or the authority to make decisions on behalf of the messaging app.  Privacy concerns have frequently put Facebook and other internet giants at odds with Brazilian law enforcement officers seeking evidence in criminal cases, although the confrontations rarely rise to the prominence of Apple Inc's current stand-off with the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, Reuters said.  In December, a Brazilian judge suspended the Facebook-owned WhatsApp messaging service for about 12 hours after the firm failed to comply with two court orders to share information in a criminal case. WhatsApp is reported to be the most used application in Brazil, with about 93 million users.  Brazilian courts have not shied away from targeting senior tech officials. Reuters reported that, in 2012, an elections court in Mato Grosso do Sul ordered the detention of Google's most senior executive in Brazil after the company failed to take down YouTube videos attacking a local mayoral candidate.	tech

The Britain Stronger in Europe director said ministers opposing the government were fortunate not to be sacked.  Critics say the ban on Leave ministers seeing documents relating to the referendum is "unconstitutional".  Out campaigners said Lord Mandelson had previously been proved wrong in calling for the UK to join the euro.  Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood faces a grilling from MPs later on the rules under which ministers can campaign for either side in the 23 June in-out referendum.  Sir Jeremy, who appears before the Commons Public Administration Committee later, has issued guidance saying ministers opposing the official government line should not be given access to government papers on the referendum or the PM's EU renegotiations - apart from ones they had already seen.  The decision has been criticised by Conservative backbench MPs and pro-EU exit ministers who have said it risks jeopardising the political impartiality of the civil service.  Mr Cameron says the row has "got slightly out of proportion" and the public should focus on the bigger issue of the merits of staying in or leaving.  In a speech in London, Lord Mandelson said the one paper anti-EU ministers could have been expected to get was "their P45".  The Britain Stronger In Europe board member also attacked the case to leave the EU as a "fantasy".  The UK would not be in a position to negotiate a preferential post-exit EU trade deal, he said.  The former EU trade commissioner said: "Brexiters cannot argue that we are weakened in the EU as it is but would suddenly be strong enough to dictate terms if we left.  "For every politician who saw the pragmatic case for dealing with the UK, there would be another who had little doubt that the UK must not be given a quick or easy ride."  He added: "In return for market access, we would be required to continue to accept many EU norms and standards.  "As a result, we would have left the EU in order to assert our national sovereignty only to find that, as a condition of access, we did not have independence from EU regulation after all."  Lord Mandelson claimed a vote to leave would lead to "years of uncertainty" and, "in the worst case scenario, a return to paying EU tariffs" while a final free trade agreement was negotiated.  He said tariffs of up to 20% "or sometimes even more" could be imposed on UK exports, including cars and whisky.  The former Labour minister's claims were dismissed by Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign.  "Peter Mandelson told us the British economy would fall off a cliff if we didn't join the euro and now he is indulging in the same scaremongering about the referendum," he said.  "He was wrong then and he is wrong now. He is starting to resemble a man wearing a sign saying the 'end is nigh'."  Labour MP Gisela Stuart, who is part of Vote Leave, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her party had "stopped thinking about what the European Union really means".  The MP for Birmingham Edgbaston said the "political stability" first offered by European nations joining together was being "seriously questioned" adding that "the European Union as an institution is not responding to it properly".  In the Commons, Chancellor George Osborne told MPs the Treasury would publish "a comprehensive analysis" of the costs and benefits of Britain's EU membership ahead of the referendum.  He said a UK exit from the EU would be "a long, costly, messy divorce".	politics

Last month it launched an inquiry into Tory general election spending in Thanet South following allegations broadcast by Channel 4 News.  It is now also looking at the reporting of hotel bills at the Newark, Rochester and Strood and Clacton by-elections.  The Conservative Party said all spending had been "correctly recorded in accordance with the law".  Strict limits apply to the amount parties and individual candidates can spend fighting elections.  Channel 4 News alleged the Conservative Party's candidate spending returns for the three by-elections were incomplete.  The commission does not have the power to investigate candidate spending, which is the responsibility of the police.  But it can investigate whether the hotel bills were reported in the overall returns for the 2014 European Parliament election and May's general election.  If the Conservative Party did include the hotel bills in its national spending returns it would be up to the police to investigate whether the party should have instead included the bills in the candidate spending returns.  The Commission can sanction a breach of the rules with a fine of up to £20,000.  The Conservatives said: "We will of course cooperate with the Electoral Commission," adding: "All spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35696804	Home Office drug strategy: Time to refresh or rethink?	With deaths from illegal drugs in England and Wales at the highest rate ever recorded one might imagine the Home Office would be desperate to ensure it had a robust and effective strategy for dealing with this current crisis.  So it comes as a surprise to discover that Ministers have quietly abandoned the idea of a formal consultation process in advance of a new drugs strategy later this month.  Traditionally, these five-year plans are put together after weeks of discussions and submissions from experts and the general public.  In 2010 there were 1,850 responses to the drug strategy consultation, including from health professionals, charities, lobby groups, local authorities, government advisors, police and service providers.  Individuals with a close interest in drug policy, often because of the death of a close relative, were also encouraged to participate.  But not this time.  The new five-year strategy has been written with hardly any public discussion at all. You won't find any details on the Home Office website. Nothing.  It is almost as though the department doesn't want to consider alternative options - which is odd because next month UK ministers will be attending the most important United Nations meeting on global drug strategy for decades.  The UN General Assembly will gather in New York to try and agree a new global drug policy.  It will decide whether the "war on drugs" should be consigned to history and a new people-centred approach adopted. In short, it is reviewing the international treaty obligations that will frame everything this country does on drugs.  So one might have thought ministers would be keen to get the views of everyone touched by drugs policy in Britain as they prepare for this historic United Nations meeting.  I understand that just two meetings specifically about the new UK drugs strategy have been held by the Home Office. They were behind closed doors and there were no votes, no reports and no minutes published.  Around the table were representatives of some of the large organisations that get paid by the government to provide drug treatment. But what about everyone else? Where were the other agencies? Where were the campaigners? Where were the victims?  The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs has been sent a draft of the new strategy and a response will be published. But members are doubtful as to whether the council's concerns at record levels of drug deaths and "disinvestment" in treatment services will have much effect on minister's minds.  The Cabinet Office recently published its "consultation principles", guidance for Whitehall on what kind of consultation process they should conduct ahead of introducing policy or legislation.  The "governing principle" is that the type and scale of the consultation should be in proportion to the potential impact of the proposal.  One must assume that in having no formal consultation process, the Home Office has decided the new drugs strategy will have little or no impact. Given record numbers of drug-related deaths, with many more people now dying from illicit drug use than in road traffic accidents, this might seem unfortunate.  When I asked the Home Office about all this, their response suggested ministers don't think there is anything to be gained from listening to alternative voices.  "Drugs are illegal where they are harmful to health and society. The UK's approach on drugs remains clear: we must prevent drug use in our communities, help dependent individuals recover, while ensuring our drugs laws are enforced."  "We are currently developing a refreshed drug strategy in line with this approach - working across government and with our external partners. This includes treatment providers, commissioners, service users and our independent experts, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs."  There you have it. Britain doesn't need a "new" drugs strategy. It just needs to "refresh" the old one - presumably because ministers believe the current approach is operating well.  The Home Office puts out the same line whenever asked about alternative approaches: "Our drugs strategy is working and there is a long-term downward trend in drug misuse in the UK".  But while the second half of the sentence is true, there must be questions about the first half. On an average day, coroners now examine six corpses where cause of death could be described as the failure of the UK's drugs strategy.	politics

A congressman said the US wanted to renegotiate the Wassenaar Arrangement.  The deal restricts the flow of arms - including "intrusion software" - to oppressive regimes. But some have said it also covers tools that can improve cybersecurity.  The move was praised by online freedom campaigners.  The proposal to amend the deal "represents a major victory for cybersecurity here and around the world," said US congressman Jim Langevin in a statement announcing the news.  "While well-intentioned, the Wassenaar Arrangement's 'intrusion software' control was imprecisely drafted, and it has become evident that there is simply no way to interpret the plain language of the text in a way that does not sweep up a multitude of important security products."  The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), which has also campaigned on the issue, agreed the deal had been reached with the best of intentions but its wording was too vague.  While the EFF was happy changes were to be considered, it remained concerned the amended arrangement would continue to have "serious chilling effects on security research".  Last year, the US authorities faced calls from Google to step back from restricting the flow of software as part of the 41-nation arms-control deal.  At the time, Google said the definition of "intrusion software" was "dangerously broad and vague" and included information about bugs and vulnerabilities that could be vital to protect systems.  Google's lawyer Neil Martin said the Wassenaar Arrangement would "hamper our ability to defend ourselves, our users, and make the web safer".  But the US authorities insisted it balanced computer security with foreign policy concerns.  Now, though, the US administration has said it supports making cyber-intrusion tools available overseas for legitimate cybersecurity activities.  The EFF said: "Human rights advocates have recognised that surveillance software designed and sold by companies in Western countries has been responsible for serious abuses around the world.  "We at EFF have long fought such abuses in court.  "We believe strongly that this is a fight worth having, but export controls are simply the wrong tool for the job."  Efforts to come up with a workable US rule have highlighted the difficulty of applying the export controls restricting physical items to a virtual world that relies on the free flow of information for network security.  Many companies operate in multiple countries and routinely employ foreign nationals who test their own corporate networks across borders.  In May, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Industry and Security proposed denying the transfer of offensive tools, defined as software that uses "zero-day" exploits, or unpatched new vulnerabilities, and "rootkit" abilities that allow a person administrator-level access to a system.  But in the cyber-world, testing a network often requires determining first how to exploit it and then attempting to do so.  US government departments did not respond to requests for comment.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35694467	First look at virtual reality Minecraft at Xbox showcase	Minecraft is already adored by millions of gamers around the world - now Microsoft has shown us what the immersive world looks like in virtual reality.  Microsoft bought the block-building phenomenon in 2014 for $2.5bn (£1.8bn) - a huge deal that had fans of the game worried about its future.  The US firm promised not to ruin its popular formula, and instead said it would invest in bringing Minecraft to the next level.  At an event in San Francisco's trendy Mission District, its Xbox division showed off the virtual reality version of Minecraft for the first time.  "It makes you feel like you're inside the world of Minecraft," said Palmer Luckey, creator of the Oculus Rift VR headset.  Like many VR experiences, it's utterly absorbing. For those obsessed with Minecraft's addictive building process, it is a big step up from watching it on a normal screen.  But for a game aimed primarily at children, there's one figure that might worry parents: $1,500.  That's the suggested amount they'll need to spend if they want to buy an Oculus Rift headset and a PC powerful enough to power it.  That's surely too expensive, I suggested to Mr Luckey.  "It isn't," he said.  "I mean, it is expensive relative to everything else out in the world, but if you look at it compared to a mobile phone or television, you're getting a lot more technology.  "It's not like this is simple hardware, and the cost is going to go down over time."  It'll need to go down pretty sharp-ish if it is to be adopted by mainstream audiences soon.  Until then, I'd predict a minor resurgence of the games arcade, a place where people go to play high-end games that they can't feasibly afford to buy for their homes.  Minecraft on Oculus was one of several games on display at Xbox's Spring Showcase, a chance for journalists - and a few influential YouTube gamers, naturally - to get hands-on with tomorrow's blockbusters.  I lost an hour within the gripping world of Quantum Break. It's a game in which you play Jack Joyce, an unwilling action hero who develops the ability to manipulate time after an experiment gone awry.  If that sounds like yet another predictable scenario for a game, you'd be right - but the title's mechanics (think "bullet time", only better) make it something special.  Also look out for Tom Clancy's The Division - set in a painstakingly true-to-life Manhattan.  Many of the titles on show were also being pushed as great to play on PC, via Microsoft's Windows 10 operating system.  "If you look at the numbers, PC gaming is the fastest growing segment of gaming out there," said head of Xbox Phil Spencer.  "It's natural that we'd focus on gaming on Windows."  When it comes to virtual reality, Microsoft has opted not to make its own headset - although it is developing the augmented reality-focused Hololens - but is instead working to make itself compatible with the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive.  On the price debate, Mr Spencer said he believed virtual reality would follow the path of high definition TVs - a luxury item to start with, but hard to resist once experienced.  "The early adopters will be there to help spur the VR industry," he said.  Given that Sony's PlayStation 4 will be getting its own VR headset, I asked if Microsoft too might consider making its own gear.  "I absolutely think it could be something that is part of our roadmap," he said. But he stressed the focus now was entirely on making Windows 10 fully-compatible with high-end VR titles.  Of course, new games mean nothing unless gamers can get online to play them. And of late, that's been something of a challenge.  Poor reliability on Xbox Live - the service Xbox gamers use to play against each other over the internet - has stressed out thousands.  Disgruntled fans include rapper Snoop Dogg, who - in a video too profane to link to here - begged Bill Gates to fix the problem or he'd defect to PlayStation.  "It's obviously always regretful," he said.  "This last outage was a concern, we learned from it. We understood exactly what the issue was, it just took a little more time that we would have liked."  He denied that the company had been the victim of a hack, saying that while its network was under constant attack it was not, as had been claimed, felled by a coordinated effort to cut gamers off.  And on the risk of losing Snoop Dogg: "Snoop's been a long-time gamer and long-time supporter of Xbox.  "I understand when people get upset. I take it as a sign of the love and commitment people have for what we are as a game platform."  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

Kiddle was registered in 2014 and is powered by Google safe search but has no connection with the tech giant.  Other words blocked by the site include lesbian and gay, a decision which has angered the campaign group Stonewall.  Kiddle says search results are "handpicked and checked" by its editors.  Other apparent search anomalies include the blocking of the term circumcision but not of FGM (female genital mutilation), suicide but not self-harm, the actress Pamela Anderson but not Fifty Shades of Grey.  Kiddle's parent company is not named on the website but one of its early testers blogged that it was set up by the Russian founder of a site called Freaking News.  A form on the site invites users to submit suggested additional key words for blocking.  Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender terms also yield no results because the site "cannot guarantee the safety" of such searches.  "Young people regularly use the internet to find information on LGBT issues," a Stonewall spokesperson said.  "Attempting to stop young people finding safe and age-appropriate content of this nature will force many young lesbian, gay, bi and trans people to seek it elsewhere. This can take individuals down inappropriate avenues which might put them at risk.  "Kiddle should rethink its approach to blocking valuable LGBT advice and information."  The BBC has contacted Kiddle for comment.  "Since Kiddle results are either handpicked and checked by our editors or filtered by Google safe search, you know you get kid-oriented results without any explicit content. In case some bad words are present in a search query, our guard robot will block the search," Kiddle states on its website.

The commission "has today begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England". (Separate commissions will be doing the same job for the other parts of the UK).  This sounds like - and, for the commission, is - a technical exercise, but the political effects will be far-reaching.  Boundary changes happen roughly every decade, but this is likely to result in the biggest shake-up of our political map in anyone's lifetime.  First, it is trying to ensure each of our votes has the same value in choosing an MP.  At the moment, voter numbers vary wildly, from 21,769 in the Western Isles (Na h-Eileanan Siar) to 108,804 on the Isle of Wight.  The Conservatives feel particularly aggrieved by this, since urban seats tend to have fewer voters, and are more likely to have Labour MPs, which can mean it takes fewer votes to elect a Labour MP than it does a Conservative one (their more suburban and rural seats tending to have bigger populations).  This has been an unintended side-effect of trying to respect both local geography and traditional boundaries.  Parliament says in future constituencies must have 74,769 voters (the number calculated according to the latest UK population). The commission can deviate by up to 5% to take account of geography and tradition, but voter numbers will be the main criteria.  The second change is the next House of Commons will be smaller. Honouring a pledge in the Conservative manifesto, there will be 600 MPs not 650.  In England, that means 501 constituencies, 32 fewer than now.  Take those two changes together, and, as Boundary Commission secretary Sam Hartley says: "These new rules mean that there is likely to be a large degree of change across the country." That is putting it mildly.  The commission had a go at this during the last parliament. Although its review was cancelled after the coalition parties fell out over it, draft proposals were published.  The only way it could make the quota of voters work was by crossing county boundaries and designing some very weird looking seats.  The city centre of Gloucester, for example, would have been combined with the Forest of Dean, and there would have been a new constituency straddling the border between Devon and Cornwall.  Legally, the commission has to ignore the previous maps it drew up, but similar combinations are bound to recur.  Trivial stuff, you may think, but the kind of thing that causes trouble locally.  It will pit local members of the same party against one another - if you're an activist in a safe seat, you won't welcome the threat of it becoming a marginal, requiring more work to defend it.  In the North West of England, there will be seven fewer constituencies in the next parliament.  Unless enough MPs choose to retire, party colleagues whose seats are being merged will fight each other over the nomination.  Dozens of political careers will end prematurely, and it won't be down to the voters. It will be down to party activists.  The changes before the 1997 general election caused particular problems for the Conservatives.  Many Tory MPs became part of what was called "the chicken run", abandoning seats whose new boundaries would make them harder to defend, choosing instead to stand in much friendlier territory.  That won't happen this time, party rules having been changed. In any case, it is not the Tories who are worried about this review. Although a few of them may lose out, the party is expected to benefit as a whole.  To meet the new quota of voters, smaller urban seats will be combined, so there will be fewer seats on which sitting Labour MPs can depend.  Add in the effect of new rules on voter registration, which appear to have resulted in a drop in the number on the electoral register, especially in areas where the population changes a lot, such as inner cities or places with lots of students, and that exacerbates Labour's problem: if you are not registered, you don't appear in the population statistics, so the Boundary Commission can't count you.  And if a constituency is changing significantly, Labour's ruling NEC will order an open selection process for the candidate for the new seat.  Sitting MPs will automatically be included, but their reselection will be far from certain.  This is the opportunity activists who support Jeremy Corbyn have been waiting for, their best to change a parliamentary party far from enamoured of its leader. However, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has denied this will happen.  Even on the present boundaries, Labour would need a 1997-size swing just to scrape into power.  Since then, it has lost all but one of its seats in Scotland. And even if it makes a dramatic recovery, that country will have six fewer constituencies.  This boundary review - conducted entirely impartially but using rules determined by Parliament - could finish off the Labour Party's chances of ever returning to government.  The public will have a say when the initial proposals are published in September, followed by 12 weeks of public consultation, including meetings around the country.  "We will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground," Mr Hartley says.  If you go along, expect to be surrounded by party activists trying to persuade the commission to alter the boundaries differently.  They won't say they are arguing for party advantage - the commission would ignore their ideas if they did - but amid all the talk of tradition, historical character, inviolable natural barriers, they will really be arguing about votes.  Earlier, I wrote the rules were being changed so everyone's vote would count the same. Not on the Isle of Wight, however.  It has too many votes for one constituency, too few for two.  So one of them would have to be shared with part of Hampshire. Faced with a Conservative rebellion during the legislation's passage, the government agreed to exempt the Isle of Wight.  Its two MPs will each represent 52,724 voters. All are equal; it's just that some are more equal than others.	politics

The Pocket FMs, as they are called, were designed by a German organisation as a way of providing Syrians with independent radio.  The devices have a range of between 4 to 6km (2.5 to 3.75 miles), which is enough to cover an entire town.  At the heart of each is a Raspberry Pi, the credit card-sized single-board computers.  About two dozen have been built, and the designer says they are intended to be as easy to set up as a piece of flat-pack furniture.  "We lost one device in Kobane", Philipp Hochleichter told BBC Radio 4's PM programme.  "But due to the bombing - not due to a malfunction."  The Pocket FMs are deployed in situations in which larger transmitters would be difficult to set up and operate.  "We tried to develop a small box that is easy to carry around, easy to transport, easy to hide [and] that is based on 12 volts so you can connect it to a solar system or a car battery", Mr Hochleichter explained.  The Pocket FMs broadcast a channel created by a network of nine stations based in the region called Syrnet.  The devices pick up a satellite feed of the channel, and rebroadcast it on a FM frequency, so people in Syria can listen on ordinary radios.  Eventually, the devices will be capable of picking up the Syrnet channel via wi-fi and mobile data. The channel is also available to listen to online, and via a mobile app.  The group behind the project is Media in Cooperation and Transition, a Berlin based non-governmental body.  As well as designing the Pocket FMs and maintaining Syrnet, MiCT employs a team of journalists, many of whom are expatriate Syrians. They help the small independent stations make programmes.  The Pocket FMs operate in the areas not controlled by either President Bashar al-Assad's regime or the so-called Islamic State militants.  "There is a space, it might be tiny, where people are against Assad and not part of the Islamic movements" said Najat Abdulhaq, who manages the Berlin-based journalists.  The station is based in Qamishli in the far north-east of Syria. An airport visible from the studio window is still under the control of the Assad regime.  "What is really annoying is you look from the window, and you see the airport and you hear the noise of the warplanes, every day, at night, the whole time," the editor-in-chief of Welat FM tells the BBC.  "A few years ago the repression of the Syrian government was everywhere," but now, he adds, radio has become an important means of communication.  Hara FM is produced in Turkey but broadcasts to Aleppo and hears from contributors in the town.  "At the moment our journalists are safe with the opposition, but it's still a war zone with gunfire and shelling," said Marwa, a Hara FM journalist based in Turkey  "I worry about our staff in Aleppo, but no journalist can be 100% safe anywhere in the world.  "For any journalist, telling the truth puts them in danger."  One of the benefits of using Raspberry Pis is that it is relatively easy to add new components.  Mr Hochleichter's latest design includes a GSM module, which allows the small transmitters to be controlled remotely by text message. The feature potentially could help the operator reduce the risk of capture.  Mr Hochleichter hopes ultimately to make the designs open source, meaning they can be shared without cost and enhanced by a wider community.  The project is funded by the German government and for Najat Abdulhaq their Berlin base is entirely apt.  "The media system in Syria under Assad is nearly a copy of the [former East Germany] GDR media system," she remarks.  "We are in the heart of East Berlin and the wall was less than 400m [1,312ft] away."  The project aims to support freedom of expression, but it is also about solidarity with people in crisis.  "When I started working on this project I had no idea of Syria," Philipp Hochleichter said.  "I now have 25 friends in this country and the way they try to make this a better country is a very good example [to others]."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35692845	Google self-driving car hits a bus	One of Google's self-driving cars crashed into a bus in California last month. There were no injuries.  It is not the first time one of Google's famed self-driving cars has been involved in a crash, but it may be the first time it has caused one.  Google is to meet with California's Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to discuss the incident, and determine where the blame lies.  On 14 February the car, travelling at 2mph (3km/h), pulled out in front of a public bus going 15mph (24km/h).  The human in the Google vehicle reported that he assumed the bus would slow down to let the car out, and so he did not override the car's self-driving computer.  The crash happened in Mountain View, near Google's headquarters.  In a statement, Google said: "We clearly bear some responsibility, because if our car hadn't moved, there wouldn't have been a collision.  "That said, our test driver believed the bus was going to slow or stop to allow us to merge into the traffic, and that there would be sufficient space to do that."  The company's self-driving cars have clocked up well over a million miles across various states in the US, and until now have only reported minor "fender benders" - the American slang for a small collision.  In all of those cases, other road users were to blame.  Google releases a monthly report detailing the testing of its self-driving technology.  Ahead of the February report's publication, due Tuesday, a traffic incident filing was made public by the DMV.  "The Google AV [autonomous vehicle] test driver saw the bus approaching in the left side mirror but believed the bus would stop or slow to allow the Google AV to continue," the report read.  "Approximately three seconds later, as the Google AV was re-entering the centre of the lane it made contact with the side of the bus.  "The Google AV was operating in autonomous mode and travelling at less than two mph, and the bus was travelling at about 15mph at the time of contact."  The car's movements were made more complex, the report said, by the presence of sandbags on the road.  Google said it had now refined its self-driving algorithm.  "From now on, our cars will more deeply understand that buses (and other large vehicles) are less likely to yield to us than other types of vehicles, and we hope to handle situations like this more gracefully in the future."  If the DMV considers the Google car to be at fault for the collision, it could be seen as a setback for the company's ambitious autonomous vehicle plans.  The bus crash came just four days after a legal breakthrough for the self-driving project - the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration told Google it would likely give the self-driving computer the same legal treatment as a human driver.  That decision would pave the way for self-driving cars without any typical controls, such as a steering wheel or pedals.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

Peers voted by 286 to 219 to delay the cuts, pending an assessment of the impact on claimants.  In January the Lords voted to remove the cuts from the Welfare Reform Bill altogether, but they were later reinstated by MPs in a Commons vote.  Ministers may try to overturn the fresh defeat at a later date.  A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "The vote in the House of Lords is a routine part of the legislative process and next steps will be announced in due course."  This stage in a bill's journey is known as "parliamentary ping pong", when legislation is batted between the two Houses until agreement is reached on its contents.  The government wants to cut Employment Support Allowance by £30 a week to encourage some new claimants to return to work.  In a bid to stave off another defeat over the plans, Work and Pensions Minister Lord Freud offered several concessions and warned peers against supporting the "wrecking amendment" which he said "undermines conventional parliamentary process".  But crossbench peer Lord Low - who put forward the successful amendment - said the cut in support to disability benefit claimants was "drastic" - and the concessions were "just not enough".  He said the government had not been able to provide evidence for its argument that the cuts "incentivised" people back to work and insisted his "moderate" amendment would give ministers time to justify the policy.  The decision by peers to inflict defeat on the government sets up another showdown between the Commons and the Lords, coming not long after last year's clash over tax credits, which led to moves by ministers to limit the powers of the Lords.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35686616	First Hololens kit to cost $3,000	Microsoft has started taking orders for a developers' edition of its Hololens augmented reality headset.  The test kit will cost $3,000 (£2,160) and will be sent to buyers in March.  Augmented reality glasses overlay computer-generated images on the wearer's real-world surroundings, unlike virtual reality which replaces the entire field of vision with images.  One expert said augmented reality devices were still at an "experimental" stage.  "I don't expect Hololens to be a mass market product due to its pricing," said Piers Harding-Rolls of IHS Technology.  "Like the early VR headsets, this will appeal to technology enthusiasts with large amounts of disposable income.  "But I think we're a good few years away from compelling consumer AR smart glasses which have the desirable content and are cheap enough to drive a broader interest in the technology."  Microsoft has stressed its developers' edition of Hololens is designed for app creators, to encourage the production of software for the device before it is more widely available.  The company said consumer availability would follow "further down the line".  It also detailed the first seven native programs available for Hololens.  Among them are:  The device will also run a game called Young Conker - a spin-off of cult hit Conker's Bad Fur Day, which told the story of a foul-mouthed squirrel trying to get home to his girlfriend.  A video of Young Conker has been negatively received by fans of the original game, who have eagerly been awaiting a sequel aimed at mature audiences.  "Why would you ever do this? This is by far the worst thing that could possibly happen to the Conker franchise," commented one disappointed gamer on YouTube.  Microsoft said it had chosen Conker because he was "the right size to believably show up in the player's world" and was "famous for breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the player".  Absent from the list of launch apps was Minecraft, the hugely popular building game, which had featured heavily in Hololens demonstrations and previews.  Microsoft says Hololens will run as a fully self-contained device running Windows 10, powered by an Intel chip.  The company says it has developed a unique "holographic processing unit" that can map the wearer's environment and recognise gestures while rendering images at the same time.  Gestures, glance and control allow the wearer to interact with the software, and the helmet supports Bluetooth accessories - the first of which is a "clicker" button users can hold.  "I think Hololens has the potential to find traction in niche commercial applications where pricing is less of an issue," said Mr Harding-Rolls.  "I see consumer AR as more embryonic than VR and still very much at an experimental stage."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35687956	Fall in election advertising spending	The amount spent on advertising by political parties went down in May's general election campaign compared with previous years, the Electoral Commission says.  But the regulator said spending on market research and "unsolicited material" for voters went up.  It said the changes might be down to a move away from traditional campaigning to a more targeted, online approach.  General levels of spending were similar to the 2010 general election.  In its campaign spending report for the 2015 general election, the commission said spending on advertising was £6.9m, compared with £9.2m in 2010, with the amount spent on campaign broadcasts down from £1.5m to £806,000.  At the same time, market research spending went up from £1.8m to £7.6m with unsolicited material up from £12.4m to £15m.  The commission also called for new powers to regulate spending at elections.  Its director of party and election finance Bob Posner said: "The law currently stops short of giving the commission the power to enforce candidates' spending rules and only the police can investigate if there's a problem.  "It's time to end that anomaly and give us the power to investigate and sanction."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35686493	Ukraine cyber-attacks 'could happen to UK'	A recent cyber-attack on Ukraine's electricity network could be replicated in the UK, according to a member of a US investigation into the resulting blackout.  "I've been getting interest and calls from the UK, Norway, Germany and all over," said Robert Lee.  "The answer is yes [they could be vulnerable]."  Last week, the US Department of Homeland Security formally blamed hackers for December's power cuts.  It did not, however, name the suspected perpetrators.  The US government is expected to publish more details of the investigation shortly.  About 225,000 people were left without power for several hours when the Ukraine suffered what is believed to be the first successful cyber-attack on an electricity distribution network.  "The way the Ukrainians set up the grid and the type of the equipment they are using is also the way a lot of other nations do it," said Mr Lee, an infrastructure specialist at cybersecurity firm the Sans Institute.  He added the attack could have been worse, as the attackers could have shut off power to a much wider area.  "This was a shot across the bows," he told the BBC.  Individual UK power firms declined to comment on their security measures.  However, a source close to the industry - who asked to remain anonymous - confirmed that "given sufficient sophistication and funding", the UK's electricity infrastructure could be hacked.  A spokesperson for the Energy Networks Association - the body that represents the UK and Ireland's gas and electricity distributors - said cybersecurity was a top priority.  The Department for Energy and Climate Change told the BBC: "The UK has... dedicated cyber experts and teams to keep it protected."  In Mr Lee's view, the attack was highly likely to have originated in Russia.  But he said it was not possible to say whether it was the "Russian government or a well-funded [non-government] team".  At least six months before the power was shut off, he explained, attackers had begun sending phishing emails to Ukraine's power utility companies' offices, containing Microsoft Word documents. When opened, they installed malware.  Firewalls separated the affected computers from the power control systems.  But the malware - known as BlackEnergy 3 - allowed the hackers to gather passwords and logins, with which they were able to mount an attack.  After months of work, they gained the ability to remotely log in to vital controls, known as supervisory control and data acquisition (Scada) systems.  Finally on 23 December, Mr Lee said, the attackers "remote desk-topped" into the Scada computers and cut power at 17 substations.  At the same time, they jammed company phone lines, making it hard for engineers to determine the extent of the blackout.  The power outages in Ukraine lasted for several hours. They were only reversed by switching to manual operations.  The attackers went to great lengths, according to Mr Lee, to make sure power supplies could not be turned back on automatically.  He said the hackers rewrote firmware in the electronic devices used to communicate with the substations' circuit breakers.  That meant that the power could not be turned on remotely even after engineers had regained control of the Scada computers.  In the end, the engineers had to visit the substations and operate them manually.  In the UK, this would take between one to two hours, the source close to the industry told the BBC.  A breach "is entirely possible", said Eireann Leverett of Cambridge University's Centre for Risk Studies, but he added "there's a lot of people working very hard to stop it".  Mr Leverett is now working on a report about what the consequences might be, due to be published in April.  Glasgow University's Professor Chris Johnson has highlighted that some of the control systems used by power distribution companies can be found for sale online.  He warns that these could be used by hackers to hunt for security weaknesses.  But Mr Lee's view can be summarised as "where there's a will, there's a way".  Companies are unlikely to be able to prevent every assault on their systems, he warns. Ukraine's hackers were "inside" the electricity companies' systems for six months, he notes, highlighting the lengths they went to.  So one lesson, he says, is that power providers must ensure they can detect attacks quickly when they occur and have staff primed to respond.  That costs money, meaning more expensive bills for consumers.  In a speech to GCHQ last year, the chancellor George Osborne said an attack on the UK's electricity network could lead to "loss of life".  He announced an extra £1.9bn of taxpayer's money over five years to bolster GCHQ's cyber capabilities.  The chancellor also said countries must work together to call out those "acting outside the boundaries of acceptable behaviour".  Mr Lee has a similar view, adding that the international community must "take a stand" if responsibility for the attacks is finally determined.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35640394	Lord Kinnock: Corbyn must back Trident to avoid defeat	Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has issued a stark warning to Jeremy Corbyn that if he continues to oppose the renewal of the Trident missile system, Labour will lose the next election.  Lord Kinnock told me in an interview for BBC Radio 4's Analysis programme that to have any chance of winning, Mr Corbyn will have to stick with the present policy of multilateral nuclear disarmament.  "No party can win a national United Kingdom election if it sustains a stance which means unilateral nuclear disarmament," he said.  The former cabinet minister Peter Mandelson also claimed that for Labour to switch back to a unilateral policy would be electoral suicide.  "The British public have never been and are never going to be unilateral nuclear disarmers. It is just something that you could never sign them up for," Lord Mandelson told me.  Labour's present multilateral policy goes back nearly 30 years. The party lost to Mrs Thatcher's Conservatives in two landslide elections in 1983 and 1987 supporting a non-nuclear policy which many believe contributed to its defeat.  Apart from Neil Kinnock and the party's communications director Mr Mandelson, one of those who engineered the policy change after the 1987 election was the party's defence spokesman, Martin O'Neill.  He is also convinced that if the present Labour review comes out in favour of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament's position, Labour cannot win the next election.  Lord O'Neill told me: "The Labour part of the British electorate, albeit declining, is still in favour of multilateralism."  He is unimpressed by the argument that if Mr Corbyn changes his mind after a lifetime's support for CND it will tarnish his vote-winning image as an "authentic" politician who does not compromise. Lord O'Neill argues this is to confuse integrity with obstinacy.  A nuclear fault line has cut through the party ever since the post-war Labour prime minister Clement Attlee decided that Britain should construct its own, independent nuclear deterrent.  The decision was never discussed by the full cabinet and that is a precedent which has been followed by Labour prime ministers whenever confronted with a serious split over nuclear weapons.  It was not until 1983, under the leadership of one of the founders of CND, Michael Foot, that the party went into an election in support of unilateral disarmament, ready to do away entirely with nuclear weapons.  Under Neil Kinnock, in the following election in 1987, which again produced a Tory landslide, this was still Labour's defence policy. It was only 18 months after this defeat, with Peter Mandelson now firmly established as Labour's chief spin doctor, that the policy was finally changed.  To my surprise, Lord Kinnock revealed that throughout his first election campaign as Labour leader he was uncomfortable with the party's anti-nuclear policy. It seems he had wanted to change tack long before the 1987 election.  Lord Kinnock told me: "From the early 1980s really, I'd recognised the unsustainability of the unilateral nuclear disarmament policy, and I was in the very uncomfortable position of having to try to sustain it."  He admits that he decided to make the U-turn in large part because of Labour's electoral position. He is convinced that Mr Corbyn should follow in his footsteps.  "I am not looking for anyone to blame," he says. "I am seeking the exercise of the skills of leadership, and they do require a combination of strength and assertiveness, because parties that are ill-disciplined simply don't enjoy the confidence and support of the electorate."  In contrast, one of those involved in Labour's current policy review, Ken Livingstone, strongly backs Mr Corbyn's position. He is convinced that a majority of Labour MPs will support him over giving up nuclear weapons.  But Mr Livingstone argues that when renewal of Trident comes up in the Commons, Labour MPs should be allowed a free vote, and not forced to follow the leadership line. "This is not the New Labour era of Blair and Brown where people are intimidated and threatened," he told the programme.  All this, of course, is music to Conservative ears; to have the main opposition party badly split over a fundamental policy issue is just what they need to help counter the effect of their divisions over Europe.  And they hold one of the most important cards: the Tories will decide when the vote on Trident renewal will be held.  It may not be in their interest to do this quickly. David Cameron's referendum campaign will not be helped by highlighting Mr Corbyn's problems. After all, Labour's support for staying in the European Union could be crucial.  But at some point, almost certainly this year, the vote will come and it may not only decide the future of Trident, it could also decide the future of Jeremy Corbyn.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35667990	Raspberry Pi 3 adds wi-fi and Bluetooth	The Raspberry Pi has become the most popular British computer yet made.  The title was formerly held by the Amstrad PCW which is believed to have sold a total of eight million units.  Sales of the Raspberry Pi will surpass that figure this month, said the Raspberry Pi project founder Eben Upton.  The milestone comes as the Raspberry Pi 3 is unveiled featuring a faster 64-bit processor and built-in wi-fi and Bluetooth connections.  "We're calling it," said Mr Upton. "We're the best-selling UK computer ever."  He said the Pi Foundation initially thought it had won the title last year when sales blew past the total set by Sinclair machines in the 1980s.  However, he said, it then emerged that the Amstrad machine had sold in larger numbers.  Now, even that total has been exceeded.  "The curve keeps trending upwards," said Mr Upton, adding that sales will get a fillip from the release of the Raspberry Pi 3 on 29 February.  It will go on sale for $35 (£30) and a "few hundred thousand units" will be available on launch day from online stores.  "The two main things that people do with their Pi are use it as a PC replacement or use it as an embedded computer," Mr Upton told the BBC.  "The Pi 3 is doubling down on both those things rather than going looking for new things to do."  The updated device has a 64-bit processor onboard that gives the Pi 3 a 50% performance improvement on the Pi 2.  Also built in to the new device are wi-fi and Bluetooth connections.  Hobbyists using the Pi to act as a hub for smart home gadgets would be able to use Bluetooth to link devices and sensors together, he said.  "This is the first Pi you can stick behind your TV and completely forget about," said Mr Upton.  There were also signs that the Pi was succeeding in achieving one of its founding aims - to make computer science a more popular option at degree level.  Mr Upton said that the Pi's popularity and other coding projects were boosting interest in the technical subject.  In some institutions, the numbers of people enrolling on computer science courses had recovered from the low points seen in 2008-9, he said.  However, he admitted it could still be be "too early" to see the full effect of the Pi on people who wished to pursue coding or their technical skills, given that the first Pi was only released in 2012.  The gadget was starting to be used widely in schools, and the Pi Foundation's merger with the Code Club initiative would make sure it reached more children, he said.  "With 9-11 year-olds, we are seeing a lot of people get excited about it at that level," said Mr Upton.	tech

He accused In campaigners of belittling Britain's strength, as if the UK was "too inconsequential" to cope outside.  David Cameron has said an EU exit would cause uncertainty and economic pain.  Labour said the Conservatives were "split down the middle" over the issue while the opposition was "united" in its backing for continued EU membership.  A referendum on whether the UK should remain in the EU or leave will be held on 23 June.  Analysis: How will a divided government work during the campaign?  The UK's EU referendum: All you need to know  The prime minister has challenged Mr Duncan Smith and other Conservative cabinet ministers campaigning for the UK to leave the EU to spell out their alternative vision.  And Chancellor George Osborne has said so-called Brexit would cause a "profound economic shock" - an argument echoed by other G20 finance ministers on Saturday.  But Mr Duncan Smith dismissed these claims as scare stories, saying Britain was the "greatest country on earth", more than capable of prospering outside the EU, which he said was more of a "political project" than a "defined economic entity".  He told the Andrew Marr Show: "I am positive about leaving the EU because I believe rather than saying it is a leap in the dark, I think it is a stride into the light. It is about hope versus pessimism and people will vote for that."  Mr Duncan Smith said the UK had "faced bigger trials than this".  "It has stood alone in war but it has also defined trade around the world...Britain is a phenomenal country. It has stood alone and fought for freedom. It has been a global trader, it can again be a global trader.  "Why would we have such a low opinion of the British people that we going about talking about a leap in the dark and profound shocks?"  Asked whether he believed the PM's argument lacked patriotism, he replied: "It is not about personalities but the In Campaign's whole strategy has been about saying 'basically we are too small, too little, inconsequential, we can't do what we want. I don't know why anyone would want to run a country like this."  While the EU was an important trading partner, he said the level of two-way trade had been exaggerated. If the UK voted to leave the EU, he said, it would be able to negotiate a simpler trade-based relationship enabling it to have "access to the world and to the EU".  "We do a deal with the EU. That is a trade deal, it is about access to our markets and access to theirs. Part of our red lines would be about us being able to control our borders as we want…That deal is very doable."  The former Conservative leader also rejected suggestions that an Out vote could trigger the break up of the UK, saying the idea that it could provoke another independence referendum in Scotland was "absurd".  Mr Duncan Smith's intervention was welcomed by the Vote Leave campaign group, which tweeted: "All the government has is project fear - we will be explaining to people project hope, how Britain and EU will be better after we take control."  But pro-EU campaign group, Britain Stronger in Europe, said Mr Duncan Smith had failed to explain how the UK could retain access to the European single market while not upholding principles of freedom of movement.  And small business minister Anna Soubry, who is campaigning to stay in the EU, said leaving would be "chaotic" and stall a much-needed process of economic reform.  "If people vote to stay in, we will remain within a reformed EU with a wind of change I believe is blowing right across it," she told Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.  "Colleagues from other countries are really talking about the need to advance the programme of deregulation, fewer directives, that we have led."  Labour's Angela Eagle accused eurosceptics of wanting to turn the clock back to the 1970s and focusing trade strategy on the rest of the Commonwealth.  "Their attention is elsewhere so we have to have to make the best of where we are," she told Marr.  "I believe that we should be confident about our values and we can project our values if we work through international organisations and the EU is one such organisation."  She claimed it "would be Labour votes" which keeps the UK in the EU and the party was "absolutely united in our determination that we get the right decision".	politics

Mr Osborne told the BBC global economic turmoil and slower growth meant "we may need to undertake further reductions".  He slowed the pace of cuts in the last spending review, but suggested savings could be announced in his 16 March Budget statement as figures showed the UK economy was smaller than expected.  Labour's John McDonnell said it was "a total humiliation" for Mr Osborne.  Speaking exclusively to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg during a visit to China, Mr Osborne said he would rather look for extra cuts now than risk breaking his own manifesto commitment to achieve a surplus in the budget by the end of this Parliament, in 2020.  The chancellor did not completely rule out raising taxes in the event of a further slowdown in growth, but said now was not the time for "significant" tax hikes.  He would not spell out the details of any further cuts, but said the Conservatives would stick to their manifesto pledge to protect some government departments.  It is understood he would not look to increase the level of cuts dramatically but would initially seek to make further efficiencies in government departments.  Mr Osborne said he wanted to "root our country in the principle that we live within our means" and would address this in the Budget.  Explaining why he was planning to make further savings, the chancellor said the global economy had got "markedly worse", the UK's economy needed to be more productive, and information from the Office for National Statistics showed it was also smaller than expected.  He said: "Because of all of those things, we have to respond to those events.  "So that's what our plan is rooted in and it may require further reductions in spending.  "I'll address that in the Budget but people should know this of me: I will do what is required to keep our country safe and secure."  He went on to say the "whole purpose of our economic plan was to have a budget surplus".  The chancellor wants to keep to his self-imposed rule of getting the books into surplus by the end of the Parliament. He could relax that rule and slow down the pace of the cuts but that's not what appears to be on his agenda.  Instead, it seems he'd rather find the money somewhere.  He wouldn't say where he'd look for cuts, but you can assume departments ministers have already pledged to protect will be safe from further austerity.  That of course means potentially tighter squeezes elsewhere.  Decisions about the level of potential future cuts will only be made once he receives the official assessments from the Office for Budget Responsibility, he added.  The extra cuts would be likely to be made towards the end of the Parliament, before 2020.  In his November statement, Mr Osborne watered down planned £4.4bn cuts to tax credits and eased back on planned spending cuts to the Home Office and other departments.  He was able to do this due to a combination of better tax receipts and lower interest payments on debt.  BBC economics editor Kamal Ahmed said that by 2020 Mr Osborne would be thinking about potentially being prime minister and leading the Conservatives into the next general election.  Mr Osborne believed having a surplus would show voters the Conservatives had "fixed the economy", he added.  Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said the British people would end up paying for Mr Osborne's own failures.  He accused the chancellor of having "sneaked off to China to admit what Labour have been saying for months - that his recovery is built on sand".  "Far from paying our way, Osborne's short-term economics means Britain is deeper and deeper in hock to the rest of the world," he said.  "If the bankers' chancellor had been doing his job properly he would be collecting taxes from Google and other tax-dodgers.  "Instead he is threatening the British people with paying an even higher price for his own failures."	politics

Mr Cook told ABC his company first learned of the controversial request when it was reported in the news media.  "I don't think that's the way the railroad should be run," he said.  "I don't think that something so important to this country should be handled in this way."  However, a source close to the investigation told the BBC Mr Cook's claim was "simply not true", and that Apple's legal team was "the first to know".  A spokeswoman for the FBI said she did not wish to comment on Mr Cook's remarks.  Elsewhere, the New York Times reported that Apple had begun working on an upgrade to its devices which would make it impossible to break into an iPhone using the method proposed by the FBI in this case.  Mr Cook was defending the company's refusal to comply with the FBI's order that it remove security blocks on Farook's device so data on it could be accessed.  He said the FBI was asking the company to make "the software equivalent of cancer".  Farook, along with his wife Tashfeen Malik, killed 14 people in the attack in December last year.  "I think safety of the public is incredibly important," Mr Cook told ABC.  "The protection of people's data is incredibly important. And so the trade-off here is we know that doing this could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities."  When asked if he was concerned Apple may hinder investigations that could prevent a future attack, Mr Cook said: "Some things are hard and some things are right. And some things are both. This is one of those things."  The FBI has argued that Apple is overstating the security risk to its devices. FBI Director James Comey said Apple had the technical know-how to break into Farook's device only in a way that did not create a so-called "backdoor" into every Apple device.  Conflicting polls suggest the American public is divided. One poll, by the Pew Research Center, suggested the majority of those polled sided with the FBI - although the researchers noted support for Apple grew among people who owned smart phones.  A Reuters poll, conducted by Ipsos, said 55% of respondents worried that the FBI would seek to use the backdoor to "spy on iPhone users".  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC or on Facebook	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35629890	How easy is it to hack a home network?	My home is under attack.  Right now, skilled adversaries are probing its defences seeking a way in. They are swift, relentless and smart. No weakness will escape their notice.  But I am not without defences. I've tried to harden the most vulnerable devices to stop them being compromised and I've set up warning systems that should alert me if the attackers get inside.  In the end, all that effort was for nothing because the attackers found so many ways to get at me and my home network. And, they said, even if the technology had defeated them, the weakest link of all - me - would probably have let them in.  I found out just how severely compromised my home network was in a very creepy fashion. I was on the phone when the web-connected camera sitting on the window sill next to me started moving. The lens crept round until it pointed right at me. I knew that the attackers were on the other end watching what I was doing, and potentially, listening to the conversation.  It is a gadget my children and I have used to see if any wildlife passes through our garden and one which many people have for home security or as an alternative baby monitor.  I was lucky that I knew my attackers who, at that moment, were sitting in my living room waiting to show me how straightforward it was to subvert these domestic devices. The picture they took of me via the camera was evidence enough.  The attackers were Dan Turner and Kyprianos Vasilopoulos from security firm Trustwave who test network defences for a living.  There were several different devices on my network that looked hackable, said Mr Turner. My router had known, unpatched security issues and the USB-connected back-up drive was also tempting but for him the web-capable camera was "the big red flag".  A few hours' work uncovered a previously unknown bug in the camera's core software that Mr Turner was able to exploit.  "It meant we were able to do things with it that we really should not be able to do," he said. "At that point it was pretty much game over."  The attack the pair developed revealed the internal passwords for the network the camera sat on. Knowing that allowed attackers to join the network with the same privileges as all the members of my family. Maybe that's why my network security system did not spot the intrusion.  It's a vulnerability that exposes more than me to potential trouble. The Shodan search engine that logs net devices lists about 1.5 million that use the same core software. That's not to say that all are vulnerable but a good percentage are probably unwitting gateways to the networks they sit on.  It's these often unregarded devices that are a big security issue, said Greg Day, European security chief at Palo Alto Networks.  Most people overlook them because they seem so mundane, he said. Even though most will be, in effect, a small computer running a cut-down version of the Linux operating system.  "You should look at the pings going out from your home network," he said. "There might be a lot more outgoing traffic than you think."  Using a network sniffing tool, I had a look and I was amazed at how much data was flowing across my home network. Desktops, laptops, tablets and smartphones were all checking in online, many constantly, to get updates or to feed ads and other content to apps.  I also found two mystery devices - one of which was revealed to be a printer and the other a digital radio I had forgotten I had hooked up to the wi-fi when I got it years ago.  Increasingly, said Mr Day, it will be the smaller, supposedly smarter devices that will expose people to security risks.  There are industry efforts to find and fix bugs in gadgets that make up the Internet of Things but not all manufacturers are reacting to reports of problems. The maker of the web-capable camera I use has been informed about the bug but it has no plans to close the loophole.  Use anti-virus software and a firewall. Keep both updated.  Update the firmware on your router. Change the default admin names and passwords. Log out when you have finished configuring it. Turn off WPS.  Make sure the operating systems on PCs, laptops, phones and tablets are kept up to date.  Be suspicious of emails bearing attachments, even from people you know.  Check the security of net-connected devices such as IP cameras, network drives and other "smart" devices. If possible, turn off their web interfaces.  Thankfully, said Mr Vasilopoulos from Trustwave, attacks on those home networks are relatively rare. Instead, cyber-thieves tended to rely on spear phishing campaigns.  "Everything starts with email," he said. "That's always the easy route."  These campaigns use carefully targeted emails that look like they have been sent by people a target knows or is likely to respond to. Names for these emails are often grabbed from social media sites such as Facebook or LinkedIn.  To demonstrate how this worked the Trustwave team faked a message to me from an attractive young woman who works at the BBC. My middle-aged vanity was all too likely to make me open the message, click on the attachment and fall victim.  If I had opened it, I would have seen an error message that asked me to OK a macro to help display the contents of the attachment. If I had, that would also have meant game over. Anti-virus software would not have spotted the dodgy macro, said Mr Vasilopoulos. Once running it searches for saleable data and steals it.  "We created a script that can get as much information automatically as it can," he said.  Suitably chastened by both these experiences, I looked into ways to harden my home network. First off was to turn off the web access to the camera. Then I unhooked the digital radio from the wi-fi.  I could go further, said Craig Young from security firm Tripwire, who has spent a lot of time studying the security shortcomings of home routers. About 80% of the top-selling routers on Amazon have security bugs, he has found.  His advice was to update the core software or firmware on a router to the latest version. Alternatively, he said, people could replace the firmware with an open source version. Digital rights group the EFF runs the Open Wireless project that creates such software.  "You should also disable WPS," he said. WPS, or Wi-fi Protected Setup, was supposed to be an easy way to get devices connected to a router. But the push-a-button-to-connect system came with flaws.  "It's a technology where the complexity of the wi-fi pass phrase gets reduced to an eight-digit pin," he said. In some cases, he added, the size of the pin is reduced further and some routers use the same default digits.  "It's a disaster," he said.  He also advised changing the default admin password and disabling the web interface for the router to make it harder to get at and take over.  "Most of the attacks on routers that we see target that HTTP service," he said.  And it did not end there. After I had followed that advice I made sure I updated all the family PCs, laptops, tablets and phones. I used the security software I had installed to scan as many machines as I could. I regularly check online accounts to make sure I'm the only one logging in. Now I'm not sure if I am more secure, or just more paranoid.	tech

The prime minister said his mother would advise the Labour leader to "put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem".  He was hitting back at a jibe from a Labour MP about his mother.  The Labour leader took a few moments to respond as Tory MPs barracked him, before offering some "motherly advice" about standing up for a free NHS.  "My late mother would have said, 'stand up for the principle of a health service free at the point of use for everybody', because that's what she dedicated her life to, as did many of her generation," he said.  A tweet then went out from Mr Corbyn's official account that quoted Albert Einstein.  "'If most of us are ashamed of shabby clothes & shoddy furniture let us be more ashamed of shabby ideas & shoddy philosophies' Einstein #pmqs," the message said.  The PM later appeared at a Conservative EU rally without a tie or jacket, joking that he had "ignored my mother's own advice".  Education Secretary Nicky Morgan defended his decision to criticise Mr Corbyn's dress sense, which followed a heckle from a Labour MP.  "What was really noticeable on Monday during the EU statement was that Jeremy Corbyn's top button was not done up, his tie wasn't straight," she told BBC Radio 4's World At One.  "Actually I think there are standards in Parliament. If you bring families or mothers into it you can expect to have a pretty firm bite-back from any politician."  A senior Labour source said: "I think when you are losing an argument, you resort to personal insult. When you are not able to answer questions on the NHS, you resort to silly insults. It's got no place in politics."  The source said Mr Corbyn had "several suits", adding: "I don't think he will be taking sartorial advice from David Cameron or his mother."  Mr Cameron's mother Mary hit the headlines earlier this month after signing a petition against cuts to children's centres in his constituency.  The two leaders were arguing about the junior doctors dispute when they began trading jibes about what their mothers would say.  Mr Corbyn asked if the PM would be "writing another letter to himself, asking on behalf of his constituents asking for the health secretary to intervene and support his local NHS?"  The prime minister was heckled by Labour MPs as he made his reply, with one shouting "ask your mother".  "Ask my mother?" said the prime minister.  "I think I know what my mother would say. I think she would look across the despatch box and she would say 'Put on a proper suit, do up your tie and sing the national anthem'."  Mr Cameron's attack delighted Tory backbenchers who cheered uproariously for more than 30 seconds.  But Labour MPs on twitter accused him of making a personal attack and of bringing Prime Minister's Questions to a "new low".  Lib Dem leader Tim Farron tweeted: "When #PMQs descends into a series of 'Your mum' comments it shows all politicians up. It's school-ground antics that demeans."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35650851	Tens of thousands could miss out on vote, watchdog warns	Tens of thousands of people could miss out on a vote in the EU referendum and May's Scottish, Welsh and English local elections after changes to the registration process.  At least 770,000 names have been removed from the electoral register, the Electoral Commission says.  The watchdog said young people had been hit the hardest.  The government says the new system will cut down on electoral fraud and "ghost" entries on the register.  Voters now have to register as individuals rather than by household.  Millions of people were transferred automatically on to the new register after having their identity confirmed by checking social security and council tax records.  Names that could not be verified in this way were kept on the register until 1 December but have now been removed.  People in England, Scotland and Wales can register to vote online - if they live in Northern Ireland they can print out a form and send it to their local registration office.  Since December, 1.3 million people have signed up to vote individually, following an advertising campaign encouraging people to get on the electoral roll in time for May's elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and council ballots across England.  But the Electoral Commission and the Labour Party said the transition had been rushed and people in short-term rental agreements, often in urban areas, and those moving on a regular basis, such as students, had been disproportionately affected.  Under the old system, universities registered students en masse.  The Electoral Commission said last June that 1.9 million names had disappeared from the register across England, Scotland and Wales as a result of the changes - although it was not clear how many of these were actually entitled to vote.  The government ignored the watchdog's advice to keep names on the register for longer to allow councils more time to check them.  In its latest assessment, the commission has "significantly" reduced its estimate of the missing names to 770,000 - although the figure is still equivalent to 1.7% of the total 43.4 million electorate.  But it also pointed out the figure was not comprehensive as the London borough of Hackney could not provide accurate information.  "It is not possible to estimate the number of eligible electors who were removed from the registers," it said in a statement.  "However, the commission reports that it is likely that some of the removed entries related to electors that were eligible to remain registered to vote."  It said the number of under-18s - so-called "attainers", qualifying to vote during the registration period - had fallen by 40% since March 2014.  In its report, the watchdog has made a number of recommendations to government to try to halt the decline in registration.  Labour said the decline in the number of young people registering to vote was "shocking", adding: "What's worse is that the government are shamelessly taking this as an opportunity to redraw constituency boundaries based on an electorate that is far lower than it should be."  The independent Boundary Commission for England said on Wednesday it had begun redrawing the map of parliamentary constituency boundaries in England.  The move follows a decision by Parliament to reduce the number of constituencies in the UK from 650 to 600, and to ensure that there are roughly the same number of electors in each constituency.  Sam Hartley, secretary to the Boundary Commission for England, said: "Once we publish our initial proposals in the autumn, we will need the help of residents in all regions to ensure that our proposals take account of local ties and best reflect the geography on the ground. Everyone's views will help us recommend a well-considered and practical set of constituency boundaries in England."  John Penrose, Minister for Constitutional Reform, said: "Councils have only removed 'ghost' electors - people who have moved, died or never existed in the first place - so keeping them on the register when we know they shouldn't be there, and then sending them all poll cards on election day, would be wrong, expensive and increase the risk of fraud.  "Equalising the size of constituencies in the Boundary Review means everyone's vote will carry equal weight.  "If we let some constituencies stay smaller than others, voters will have more power in them than people in bigger ones. And the boundaries would be based on data that's 20 years out of date. That can't be fair or right."  Separate figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest 600,000 people have fallen off the register in the past year.  The ONS said the total size of the UK electorate was 44,722,004.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35652271	Google promotes fast-loading AMP news articles	Google has begun promoting web-based news articles that comply with its effort to make pages load more quickly on mobile devices.  Stories coded according to the Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) initiative's guidelines appear in a dedicated carousel in the firm's search results.  It says this will help the public find pages that load "blazingly fast".  However, it is likely to disadvantage sites that opt not to take part.  Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai also told an audience in Paris that his firm would offer to defend news organisations against distributed denial of services attacks.  DDoS attacks involve a perpetrator flooding a site with traffic to knock it offline, and often involve hijacked PCs to bolster the assault's force.  The AMP project was first announced last October, at which point "dozens" of sites said they were taking part.  Google has revealed that the list has since expanded to more than 160 news providers across Europe.  In addition, it said, other news sites in the US, Brazil, Japan, Indonesia and Mexico were taking part, and there were plans to extend AMP further soon.  Blogging platform Wordpress has also enabled its users to have their pages automatically translated into AMP-enabled pages, which could swell numbers further.  AMP pages load on smartphones and tablets between four and 10 times faster than those made in traditional HTML.  Once a user has read an article, they can flick to the side to see another publication's take on the same topic.  Much of the Javascript code normally used with the webpages is absent, meaning loading the articles should also use less battery power.  Publishers can continue to use paywalls and tap into the same ad networks as before, but they will not be able to display some types of adverts including pop-ups and "sticky" images that move as users scroll down a page.  The effort acts as a disincentive to people who might otherwise have used ad-blockers to speed up loading times.  In addition, it helps Google deal with a threat from Facebook. The social network is promoting its own Instant Articles scheme, which makes third-party content appear more quickly by hosting it on Facebook's own servers.  The BBC is involved in both schemes.  "With over 65% of traffic to BBC News coming from mobiles or tablets, optimising this performance is crucial," said BBC executive Robin Pembrooke.  "Google AMP is another important step to help achieve this goal."  AMP is open source, meaning anyone can adopt the technology without having to seek Google's permission.  Because of the firm's dominance in search, organisations may feel compelled to join to avoid losing traffic.  Mr Pichai also invited independent news organisations to join Project Shield without charge.  This is a scheme originally launched in 2013 to offer select organisations the same DDoS protection used by Google itself.  It works by using a technology called a reverse proxy, which lets Google identify and stop "bad traffic" before it reaches the news organisations' computers.  To enable this, news organisations will have to let Google see the data flowing to their sites.  Google says it will use the information only to protect them and will delete raw traffic logs a fortnight after each is created.  DDoS attacks are an increasing threat to news sites. One attack briefly knocked the BBC's news site offline in December.  However, one expert suggested that bigger news organisations were likely to continue to manage their own security.  "Google's product doesn't offer the same level of customisation as commercial services, but its simplicity will be appreciated by smaller-scale organisations without specialist technical experts," said Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London.  "A potential side effect is that some countries might find it harder to censor the website without blocking all of Google's other services."  He added, however, that there was a risk that some legitimate users would be accidentally blocked.	tech

Troy Hunt reported that a flaw with the electric vehicle's companion app also meant data about drivers' recent journeys could be spied on.  Mr Hunt said he gave the firm a month to fix the issue before he decided to make it public.  Nissan said it could not yet comment.  The problem remains unresolved but Mr Hunt said car owners could protect themselves by disabling their Nissan CarWings account. Those who have never signed up are not at risk.  Mr Hunt acknowledged that the issue was not life-threatening, but said hackers could still exploit the NissanConnect app's vulnerability to cause mischief by running down people's batteries.  "The right thing to do at the moment would be for Nissan to turn it off altogether," Mr Hunt told the BBC.  "They are going to have to let customers know. And to be honest, a fix would not be hard to do.  "It's not that they have done authorisation [on the app] badly, they just haven't done it at all, which is bizarre."  The BBC contacted the Japanese carmaker but a spokeswoman said it was not yet able to comment.  Mr Hunt said the root of the problem was that the firm's NissanConnect app needed only a car's vehicle identification number (Vin) to take control.  The code is usually stencilled into a car's windscreen, making it relatively easy to copy.  The initial characters of a Vin refer to the brand, make of car, and country of manufacture/location of the firm's headquarters.  So, Mr Hunt said, it would only be the final numbers that varied between different Nissan Leafs based in the same region.  "Normally it's only the last five digits that differ," he explained.  "There's nothing to stop someone from scripting a process that goes through every 100,000 possible cars and tries and turn the air conditioning on in every one.  "They would then get a response that would confirm which vehicles exist."  Attackers would not even need to use the app, he added, since the commands could be sent via a web browser.  To confirm the problem, Australia-based Mr Hunt used the Vin number of a Nissan Leaf-owning acquaintance based in the UK.  "I was sat in the vehicle with everything powered off and didn't have my key on me," recalled Scott Helme, who is also a cybersecurity adviser.  "So, the vehicle was as it would be if it was completely unattended.  "As I was talking to Troy on Skype, he pasted the web address into his browser and then maybe 10 seconds later I heard an internal beep in the car.  "The heated seat then turned on, the heated steering wheel turned on. And I could hear the fans spin up and the air-conditioning unit turn on."  Further tests indicated that the hack did not work if the vehicle was in motion.  But it was possible to see the owner's registered username, which might help reveal their identity.  Furthermore, times and distances of recent journeys were disclosed, but not location data.  As soon as Mr Helme unregistered his app, Mr Hunt could no longer contact his car.  "It's not as bad as it could be," Mr Helme told the BBC.  "But if I was to monitor your movements over the course of the week and learn when you go to and from work, shortly after you got to your office I could run the heating for the remainder of the day.  "That would potentially leave you with very little power - certainly not enough to get back home."  Further analysis indicated that the app does not talk directly to the cars, but instead sent its commands via Nissan's computer servers.  As a result, Mr Hunt said, it would be easy for Nissan to suspend the service.  The researcher also discovered that some Canadian owners of the Leaf had discovered and shared knowledge of the flaw on an online forum and had posted a web address that could be used to spoof the app.  "I decided we were past the point of not letting the cat out of the bag," he said, justifying his decision to blog about the discovery before Nissan had issued a fix.  "Unfortunately what we are seeing is just another case of security being important after a problem is discovered," he added.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35648857	MWC 2016: Xiaomi unveils ceramic-backed Mi5 smartphone	China's Xiaomi has unveiled the ceramic-cased Mi5 Android smartphone, highlighting the top-end version of the handset is a fraction of the price of its rivals' flagships.  The company held press conferences for the launch in Beijing and at Barcelona's Mobile World Congress.  The European press conference has fuelled speculation Xiaomi is preparing to expand sales beyond Asia and Brazil.  However, the company made no mention of any such plan during the presentations.  In fact, its representatives told MWC attendees the event was a "preview" rather than a launch.  "It suggests that Xiaomi has still not resolved issues over intellectual property and patent rights that it needs to do to put the handsets on sale in Europe and North America," said Ben Wood, from tech consultancy CCS Insight.  "Doing that will come with a price tag.  "But coming to MWC gives Xiaomi access to hundreds of the top analysts, journalists and other industry commentators to help raise awareness of the Mi brand before any such launch."  Another analyst agreed the company needed to expand further.  "Xiaomi missed its 2015 smartphone shipment target by seven million, because it was too exposed to the Chinese market, where fast growing iPhone sales hurt it," said Ian Fogg, from IHS Technology.  "We see increasing numbers of Xiaomi smartphones appearing in use around the world, in many countries where Xiaomi smartphones are not officially on sale.  "[So] other smartphone makers must continue to look over their shoulder, even if Mi5's official availability remains limited to a handful of countries."  Xiaomi describes itself as the world's fifth bestselling smartphone company.  Its handset shipments rose 23% last year, giving it about 5% of the global smartphone market, according to market research company IDC.  Xiaomi executive Hugo Barra told the MWC audience its ceramic body added to the Mi5's manufacturing costs but made it more durable.  Nokia used to make phones using the material, but most rivals currently use glass, metal or plastic cases.  Mr Barra said the 5.1in (13in)-screened Mi5, at 6.95mm (0.27in) and 129g (0.28lb), was thinner and lighter than Apple's iPhone 6S and Samsung's Galaxy S7.  But its Chinese rival Huawei's P8 phone is about 0.5mm thinner.  Mr Barra said the Mi5, on sale in China from 1 March, would be the first phone to feature Qualcomm's Snapdragon 820 processor.  To deliver more realistic colours, it would also use a new Sony camera sensor to stop light leaking from one pixel to another.  And the 16 megapixel camera also had a new "four-axis" optical stabilisation feature to prevent blurry photos in dim-lit surroundings.  Xiaomi had also secured 21 patents of its own for its display technologies, Mr Barra said, mostly in China, although one had been in the US.  And the Mi5's "sunlight display" allowed it to adjust the contrast of each pixel in real time when used outside.  "It makes the darker parts of the content - whether it's a photo or anything that you are looking at - lighter, so you can see it better, without making the light parts lighter too, which would explode [the image] and use too much power," Mr Barra said.  He added the handset would be preinstalled with Xiaomi's new video chat app, Mi Video Calls, which auto-enhanced people's appearance and allowed graphics to be superimposed in real time.  The app is also being released for other Android and iOS handsets.  Xiaomi said the top-end edition of Mi5 would cost 2,699 yuan ($413; £297), which was:  However, Mr Cross questioned whether Xiaomi would be able to offer such a wide margin of difference in the West.  "From a specs perspective, it certainly ticks lots of the boxes," he said.  "However, there are the intellectual property costs and if people aren't aware of the brand that means it will also have to pay a 'marketing tax' because people won't know or trust it yet.  "So, although there's an awful lots of excitement about Xiaomi in China, companies like Samsung, LG and Apple will be more concerned about Huawei for now."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35648918	Remarkable Boston Dynamics robot puts up with bullying	Boston Dynamics - the robotics firm owned by Google - has created a humanoid that is able to withstand all manner of bullying and still achieve its task.  Researchers push, kick and tease the remarkable new Atlas robot, which is an upgrade of models we've seen from the firm previously.  Despite the distractions, Atlas continues with its task of picking up and moving boxes.  In one instance, a member of the Boston Dynamics team gives Atlas such a severe whack to its upper back that it falls over, face first on to the floor.  After a moment of reflection, the robot pushes its arms out and jolts itself upright, before somewhat dejectedly walking out of the building.  Other demonstrations shown in the video posted by Boston Dynamics show Atlas walking around in the snow, righting itself whenever it encounters difficult terrain.  "It is electrically powered and hydraulically actuated," the company explained.  "It uses sensors in its body and legs to balance and LIDAR and stereo sensors in its head to avoid obstacles, assess the terrain and help with navigation."  The robot is 5ft 9in (175cm) tall and weighs 180lb (82kg).  We learned in December last year that plans to develop a four-legged dog-like robot had been shelved after it was deemed too noisy for its purpose on combat zones.  It had been hoped that the robot would be able to follow troops while carrying extra kit.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35585087	Fake girlfriend, revisited	Sophia, as she called herself, charged $5 (£3.50) a week to be in a relationship with me on Facebook.  She'd leave messages, laugh at my hilarious status updates and, most important of all, change her relationship status to say we were an item.  As an experiment, I tried to see if my friends would be duped by this arrangement, one which I could describe only as a form of escorting - although strictly online only.  After a long week, I came clean to both my friends and Sophia.  I told them it was all a joke, and I nervously told her I was a journalist.  Thankfully, she was up for a chat.  "The whole Sophia thing is just my marketing username," she said.  "Nothing on that Facebook profile is real. My photos on there are really me, but nothing else is."  She said she was doing it to save money so she could go away and study.  But that was 2013, and this is now. Has fake girlfriend tech moved on?  While browsing Product Hunt, a great site that highlights new apps and ideas, I recently spotted an intriguing service called Invisible Girlfriend.  It promised me the chance to sign up and create my perfect girlfriend, and soon I'd start getting text messages from her so I could impress all of my friends.  "My cofounder had the idea for years," said Kyle Tabor, the site's chief executive, in an email.  "He mainly needed a fake girlfriend to get his parents off his back after he was divorced."  It works like this. You pick from one of six broad personality types - because there are only six types of women in the world, you understand. Rejecting "saucy and sarcastic" I went with "lovingly nerdy".  Faced with a stock photo library of about 30 people, I picked out a picture of a pretty brunette. I should, apparently, save it to my phone to show my friends later.  After a selecting a few standard interests - "lower league English football" wasn't available - I was then given help concocting a convincing back story. We met at an office party, and she's the girl of my dreams.  Her name? That was left to a name generator.  I guessed I'd have to get used to it.  Time to get down to some serious pro-flirting via text.  "Hi Alma, what are you up to?" I offered, sultrily.  A few minutes later, she replied: "Not much, early day at work so I'm home already. What about you?"  Bored already? Me too. But that's what makes this service more interesting than I'd first assumed.  I thought this would essentially be a sex line. So if I said: "What are you up to?", the answer would be an attempt at sexiness, like: "Ooh, I'm all alone ;);)" and so forth.  Yet the service seems to strive to be somewhat unsexy, almost mundane - like real life. I half expected her to ask me to pick up some milk on the way home.  That authenticity is helped by the fact that the texts are written by real people, a team of "real anonymous humans" replying to every message.  My cagey attempts to inject a bit of rudeness fell flat. The raunchiest exchange being: "What's the sexiest thing you could wear?" met with: "My skin lol. Or a skirt".  "Can you send me a pic of yourself?" I asked, only to get "O->-<" in return. That's an emoticon of a person lying down, in case you can't tell.  I'd have pushed it further, but the thought of some "real anonymous" bloke texting me back made me feel strange.  To sum up: a ludicrous, pathetic idea, that no-one would possibly take seriously. Or so I thought.  "We have had thousands of users pay for the service," Mr Tabor told me.  "It's about 50/50 between the text only and the full suite."  You read that right. People pay for this (according to Mr Tabor at least).  If you just want text messages, it costs $15 a month. The full suite is $25, and you get voicemails and all sorts for that.  The service isn't just for fake girlfriends, either. The site also lets women, or gay men, sign up and have a fake boyfriend. And what Mr Tabor said next surprised me the most.  "Actually, over 60% of our accounts choose boyfriends."  Consider me baffled. Why would anyone want or need this?  "Get parents off your back, get a co-worker to stop hitting on you, make an ex jealous, or maybe just to practice flirting."  His team takes the illusion responsibility seriously.  I wanted to use the image of my beloved Alma Doris in this article, but Mr Tabor politely asked that I didn't, on the off-chance it might blow someone else's cover story.  An extensive how-to guide contains tips such as how to talk about your girlfriend/boyfriend, what questions to expect from pushy friends, and common mistakes people make when lying through their teeth about an imaginary human. There's even a live chat function to ask for advice from the site's staff.  But in the end, I had to break up with Alma Doris.  "I'm moving to Yemen," I said. She didn't understand.  If this service seems sad to you, then don't laugh. Just be thankful. Many users, Mr Tabor said, used the service for companionship. Someone to text for a chat now and then.  Like Sophia in 2013, Invisible Girlfriend and Boyfriend is satisfying a need, and a harmless one at that.  If people are prepared to pay for a service, and others are prepared to provide it - then fine.  And for the record, the woman behind Sophia did go on to save enough to study. Late last year, she certified as a fully qualified dietician.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35643213	UN bans lithium batteries as cargo on passenger planes	Passenger planes should be banned from carrying large numbers of lithium batteries as cargo, says a UN aviation watchdog.  The International Civil Aviation Organisation says the ban is necessary because batteries can create intense fires that could destroy aircraft.  The ban is scheduled to come into force on 1 April.  Adoption of the ICAO decision is not compulsory but many countries do adopt the agency's recommendations.  The ban does not affect the batteries inside gadgets people take into the passenger cabins of planes.  The ban will remain in place until at least 2018 when the ICAO is expected to conclude work on safe ways to pack and transport the batteries, said Olumuyiwa Benard Aliu, president of the ICAO council.  The Rechargeable Battery Association, which fought the ban, said its members were preparing to comply. It added that the transport restriction could lead to "significant disruption in the logistics supply chain", especially for medical devices.  While the majority of lithium-ion batteries are transported on cargo ships, about 30% are still delivered by air. Many travel in the holds of passenger aircraft rather than in dedicated cargo planes. A single cargo container can hold thousands of batteries.  The US Federal Aviation Administration estimates that air carriers who transport batteries in bulk to the US also carry about 26 million passengers a year.  Tests by aviation bodies have established that lithium-ion batteries can self-ignite and burn with a heat of about 600C - close to the melting point of the aluminium used in the superstructure of many aircraft.  Separate tests have also established that overheated batteries can give off fumes that, if they build up, can lead to explosions that knock out onboard fire suppression systems letting the fires burn uncontrolled.  The tests led Boeing and Airbus to declare in 2015 that continuing to ship lithium-ion batteries in bulk was "an unacceptable risk".	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35638096	Nasa and the amazing space printer	If you have ever struggled getting hold of a spare part for an appliance, consider the astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), where deliveries are not exactly regular, and postage is rather extortionate.  There has only ever been one way to get something into space: blast it up there. It is expensive - every ounce of weight costs thousands of pounds.  If we are ever going to survive in space, this simply will not do. Sooner or later, we are going to have to start making things without relying on Earth.  The first step of this inspiringly significant process was unveiled recently by Nasa at its research park in Silicon Valley.  On 23 March, a 3D printer will be blasted up to the six-strong crew in the ISS. It will be used to make spare parts, as well as experiments.  A prototype printer - the first manufacturing device ever in space - has already been trailed by the ISS crew. This new model, however, will see the project move into being fully operational.  "You can bring us a USB stick with your file, and we can digitally send it to space," says Andrew Rush, chief executive of Made In Space, the Nasa-funded start-up developing the technology.  "Via 3D printing we can make that object and completely avoid putting it on a rocket."  Given $20m (£14.2m) by Nasa, Made In Space is also working on Archinaut, a system the company said would one day enable the manufacture of huge structures that could be assembled, in space, by robots.  Mr Rush plans "giant radio dishes that could service many people, or do amazing science and peer deep into the universe's past".  Right now, sending big items into space is a task described by Nasa as "like origami".  Structures are folded up for launch, and then expanded and constructed once in orbit.  Being able to build in space would remove the significant logistical restriction of working out what can survive been blasted off the Earth strapped to a rocket.  The team estimates it will be three to four years before the huge ambitions materialise.  The technology will be licensed out to commercial enterprises.  Not far up the road from Nasa, you will find Tesla - a very willing collaborator.  Until then, experiments with the small-scale 3D printer will be the focus of Made In Space's efforts.  In particular, the team is looking intently at how to use raw materials found in space - including on the surface of moons, and Mars.  "The space environment is a very valuable and unique environment," says Mr Rush. "We can make things that would just be impossible to create on Earth.  "This will eventually enable us to really live off the land, not only in micro-gravity, but on other moons and planets."  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35639233	Bill Gates calls for terror data debate	The row between Apple and the FBI over access to a dead murderer's phone should start a debate about government requests for data, says Bill Gates.  The FBI wants Apple to unlock the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook who killed 14 people in December last year.  Apple has resisted the demand saying the FBI order was "dangerous" and "unprecedented".  Speaking to the Financial Times, the Microsoft founder said complying would not put a backdoor in all iPhones.  "This is a specific case where the government is asking for access to information," he said in the interview. "They are not asking for some general thing, they are asking for a particular case."  Mr Gates said the case was similar to the requests regularly made to phone companies and banks for information.  In a separate interview with the BBC, Mr Gates reiterated his view that the issue came down to a debate about whether governments can get at data they use to protect citizens.  "Should governments be able to access information at all or should they be blind, that's essentially what we are talking about," he told the BBC.  Microsoft itself has not formally commented on the row between the FBI and Apple. However, when pushed on the issue Microsoft referred to a statement issued by the Reform Government Surveillance group of which it is a member.  That statement sides with Apple saying: "Technology companies should not be required to build in backdoors to the technologies that keep their users' information secure."  It emerged this week that the US Department of Justice is asking for Apple's help to get at data on iPhones relevant to more than a dozen separate investigations. The Wall Street Journal said the cases came from several different criminal investigations and data locked on the handsets would help law enforcement.  None of the cases is believed to be related to terrorism and many involved older iPhones that lack the stronger security protections found on newer devices.  More recently, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said he was "sympathetic" to Apple's stance in the row.  The attack in San Bernadino by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik in December last year left 14 people dead and 22 injured.  In a statement published on Sunday, FBI director James Comey said its demand for access to the data on the phone was "about the victims and justice".  Slightly more than half of all Americans, 51%, when asked whether Apple should unlock the phone, believe it should comply with the FBI's order, according to a survey carried out by the Pew Research Center. Of those questioned, 38% said Apple should resist the call and 11% had no opinion.  On Monday, Apple boss Tim Cook sent a letter to the firm's employees about the row saying its refusal was about a broader civil rights issue not just this one case.  It also called for the US government to set up a government panel on encryption to look into the ways law enforcement can ask for access to data.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35641151	MWC 2016: Is Facebook about more than 'making money'?	He's the world's wealthiest and most powerful 31-year-old, but he still feels misunderstood. That's what emerged from Mark Zuckerberg's 60-minute chat with a Wired journalist on stage at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  Misunderstood in India, where his attempt to give millions their first taste of the internet via Facebook's Free Basics scheme has been banned for offences against net neutrality, a "disappointing" move which taught him that "every country is different". And misunderstood more generally in his passionate mission to use his company to change the world.  "A lot of people think companies don't care about anything but making money," he said, before going on to explain that had not been the motive in setting up Facebook. He'd just wanted to connect people at Harvard, and then found that turning his networking site into a business was the best way to carry that idea further.  When I shared those quotes in a tweet, the reaction was largely cynical. Most people seemed to feel that yes, companies don't care about anything but making money. I don't think that is quite fair - when people say that all businesses are venal or that all politicians are corrupt, I always wonder whether they think that their own motives are somehow pure.  But what is true about Mark Zuckerberg is that his mission to connect the world - which I think is sincere - is also a very profitable business for Facebook. Building drones to take internet connections to remote parts of Africa, investing large sums in virtual reality and making the most detailed map of exactly where people live are all exciting and valuable projects. Deciding that video is now going to be the most important way we communicate - as Zuckerberg said on stage last night - also seems far-sighted.  They are however all ways of drawing more and more people into Facebook's world where all of their needs can be met - and much of their data (anonymised of course) can be handed over the advertisers. By doing great stuff, Mr Zuckerberg's business also ends up making great profits.  So. when he questioned the mobile industry's focus on using next generation 5G networks to connect things, rather than people in developing countries - and got a round of applause in the hall - you might think what a noble sentiment. Or you might think it would serve Facebook's interests better if the networks spent money hooking up more people rather than connecting fridges and cars to the internet.  Some have asked similar questions about Tim Cook and his refusal to unlock a terrorist's iPhone, a stance backed by Mark Zuckerberg here last night. The US government has described the campaign against the court ruling as simply part of Apple's marketing strategy. Now you can be sympathetic to Apple's arguments on encryption, while recognising that an ultra-secure iPhone is a crucial aspect of the company's brand and its future profit path.  Silicon Valley and its leaders live in something of a bubble, amazed that the rest of the world does not always see things its way on issues ranging from the benefits of sharing data online to the primacy of individual privacy over public safety. And that means that Mark Zuckerberg and his fellow tech billionaires are going to continue to find that the world does not always understand them.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35629381	Zuckerberg is 'sympathetic' to Apple in its clash with FBI	Facebook's chief executive has said he is sympathetic to Apple's position in its clash with the FBI.  The FBI has ordered Apple to disable the security software on a dead murderer's iPhone but the tech giant has refused.  Mark Zuckerberg said he did not believe the authorities should have backdoors to bypass encryption protection.  However, a lawyer representing some of the gunman's victims has backed the federal bureau.  Stephen Larson, a former judge, said he intended to file legal paperwork next month telling Apple to co-operate.  "They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen," he added.  He declined to say how many of the victims he was representing, but did add that he would not be charging them a fee.  Mr Zuckerberg made his comments at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona.  "I don't think that requiring back doors to encryption is either going to be an effective thing to increase security or is really the right thing to do," he said.  "We are pretty sympathetic to Tim [Cook] and Apple."  He added that Facebook was committed to doing all it could to prevent terrorism but his company was in favour of encryption.  The social network had previously issued a statement saying that the court order could create a "chilling precedent".  Leaders at Google and Twitter also voiced support for Apple last week.  Fourteen people were killed and 22 injured when gunman Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik opened fire in California last December.  Apple's chief executive Tim Cook has described the FBI's order as "dangerous" and "unprecedented".  He has said the firm would have to build a new operating system in order to comply.  "We strongly believe the only way to guarantee that such a powerful tool isn't abused and doesn't fall into the wrong hands is to never create it," the firm stated in a Q&A on the Apple website.  In a statement published in Sunday, the FBI Director James Comey said the demand was "about the victims and justice".  "We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly," the FBI director wrote.  "That's it. We don't want to break anyone's encryption or set a master key loose on the land.  "Maybe the phone holds the clue to finding more terrorists. Maybe it doesn't. But we can't look the survivors in the eye, or ourselves in the mirror, if we don't follow this lead."  Last week anti-virus creator John McAfee offered to unlock the iPhone for the FBI.  "It will take us three weeks," he told Business Insider, adding that he would eat his shoe on television if his team failed.	tech

Apple has been ordered to help FBI investigators access data on the phone belonging to San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook. Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the California city last December before police fatally shot them. A court order has demanded Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information. Apple is refusing to co-operate.  But Janet Napolitano told BBC HARDtalk: "I concluded that in our law there's no Apple exception... and that if you go through the process and you apply to the court and you've made the showing about why the information is necessary, law enforcement should prevail and in previous cases that has been the case."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35633915	MWC 2016: Facebook uses AI to map people's homes	Facebook has announced it will make highly detailed maps of where it believes people are living available to the public later this year.  The social network has been using artificial intelligence software to scan satellite imagery and identify human-built structures.  It hopes to use the information to determine where internet-beaming drones would best be deployed.  But it suggests others could also make use of the maps.  "We believe this data has many more impactful applications, such as socio-economic research and risk assessment for natural disasters," Facebook said in a blog.  "I am torn in my reaction between excitement at the technical innovation and concern about the public policy issues," said Emily Taylor, an associate fellow at the Chatham House think tank.  "This takes knowing your customers to stalker-like levels."  But the British Red Cross charity said the initiative could potentially help it locate vulnerable communities.  Facebook first detailed its work on the mapping project last year, in a briefing about its Aquila drones.  At the time, the social network's engineering chief, Jay Parikh, said the technology could spot structures as small as a tent.  He said the population maps it produced were many times more detailed than those of an alternative scheme co-ordinated by Columbia University, the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) project, which seeks to collate existing data.  "You look at the Middle East, and all of a sudden there are big splotches," he said of the GPW's maps.  "Your intuition says that's probably not how people are distributed in terms of living.  "We can be much more precise and exact [with our] fine grain level of information."  In its update - released to coincide with the Mobile World Congress tech show - Facebook said it had analysed 14.6 billion satellite images covering 20 countries. This had resulted in 350TB of data.  "Our final data set has a spatial resolution of 5m [16.4ft] and thereby improves over previous countrywide data sets by multiple orders of magnitude," it said.  It added, however, the task had not been without problems.  "While recognising structures in aerial imagery is a popular task in computer vision, scaling it to a global level came with additional difficulty.  "Aside from processing billions of images, finding buildings with high fidelity in rural areas is really a needle-in-a-haystack problem.  "Typically, more than 99% of the landmass we analyse does not contain any human-made structure, and it therefore poses a challenge for the machine learning algorithms to learn from such an unbalanced data set."  Facebook intends to use the maps to inform its Internet.org initiative, which aims to connect more people to the internet.  The company is currently developing drones that would extend internet signals beyond cities via lasers beamed between the aircraft.  Although it will be several years before Facebook hopes to have the technology ready, the maps could allow it to work out where the drones would have the most impact.  In the meantime, others hope the data could prove useful for their own efforts.  The Red Cross already has a map initiative of its own, the Missing Maps Project, developed in conjunction with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and Medecins Sans Frontieres.  It said the extra information could help the organisations respond more effectively to people in need.  "There are many areas globally that still remain off the digital map," said British Red Cross maps expert Andrew Braye.  "These areas are also home to vulnerable communities at risk from natural disasters or conflict.  "Organisations that share open data are enabling the humanitarian sector to respond more rapidly.  "The information is then available to emergency responders and assists with decision-making."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35631456	MWC 2016: Mastercard rolls out selfie ID checks	Credit card firm Mastercard has confirmed it will accept selfie photos and fingerprints as an alternative to passwords when verifying IDs for online payments.  It follows a trial of the software carried out in the US and Netherlands last year.  The company told the BBC that 92% of its test subjects preferred the new system to passwords.  One expert said that such biometric checks had the potential to cut fraud.  However, some security researchers have questioned how easy it might be to spoof the system.  Mastercard announced the move at the Mobile World Congress tech show in Barcelona.  It said the rollout this summer would involve the UK, US, Canada, Netherlands, Belgium, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.  It explained that members of the public would have to download an application to their PC, tablet or smartphone to use the system.  When they make an online purchase, they will still need to provide their credit card details as normal.  But if a further authentication check is required, they will be asked to look at their phone's camera or use its fingerprint sensor rather than be told to type in selected letters from their password, as is the case at the moment.  If the user opts for a selfie, they will have to blink into the camera to prove they are not just holding up a photo.  "Consumers hate passwords," declared Ajay Bhalla, chief of the firm's safety and security division.  "We know the most commonly used password is 123456, so they are not secure, and people also use the same passwords for multiple sites. If one site gets hacked all the places that you use the same password get compromised - they are a big pain.  "In the modern world everyone has a mobile phone and there is internet connectivity everywhere. So, we should be able to use biometrics [instead] to authenticate ourselves."  Mastercard is far from the only firm experimenting with facial scans as authentication tools.  China's e-commerce giant Alibaba recently demoed a pay-with-your-face system of its own.  And both Microsoft's Windows 10 and Google's Android operating systems already allow users to unlock devices by looking at their cameras.  Security researchers have pointed out that both facial scans and fingerprint sensors can be compromised.  Even so, Mastercard insists its other security mechanisms should be able to prevent or at least detect suspicious behaviour.  In addition, it says the facial scans and fingerprint data will not be transmitted in a form that could be intercepted, stolen or used by scammers.  Smart wallet systems including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay have already introduced consumers to the concept of using their fingerprints to authorise payments.  Many Japanese bank ATMs also have a reader that scans the vein patterns beneath customers' fingers to let them withdraw cash.  One expert said other biometric tests could soon become the norm.  "Having one or more required authentication factors tied to who you are rather than what you know is going to become critical," said Windsor Holden from the tech consultancy Juniper Research.  "The problem with online payments has always been that the card doesn't need to be present, hence the credit card companies have charged more for the transactions to cover the costs of fraud.  "If they can introduce a mechanism that makes the system more secure than merely asking for a password, then the hope would be that fraud levels decrease and the savings can be passed back onto merchants, and perhaps consumers too."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35629322	MWC 2016: Zuckerberg takes Samsung into a VR future	It's easy to be cynical about phone launches.  Thousands of excited fans - or jaded journalists - pack into grandiose events to be deafened by Coldplay or U2 and hear nervous executives read from an autocue that they are "really excited" to reveal a "life-changing" innovation that looks much like last year's model.  And yes, there was a certain amount of that at the Samsung Unpacked event in Barcelona last night. The Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge are what you would expect from the Korean company - extremely capable, state-of-the-art smartphones with excellent cameras.  But these days half a dozen manufacturers can build a device we would have thought miraculous a few years ago, so a company like Samsung has to do more.  And last night it did. The first clue was the Gear VR headset placed on each seat as we trooped into the vast hall.  A voice from the sound system - in between snatches of Coldplay - explained patiently how to put it on. Then during the event we used the headset twice - once for the moment of the big reveal of the Galaxy S7, where a virtual box was opened, and more impressively to demonstrate Samsung's new 360 camera.  Looking around at a Barcelona street scene with footballers playing keepy-up gave a glimpse of what users might do when they get their hands on the Gear 360 and share what they see on YouTube or Facebook.  But it was the real coup de theatre which came next. As we removed our headsets, the most famous young man in the technology world appeared on the stage.  Mark Zuckerberg is known to be an enthusiast for VR - after all he spent a chunk of Facebook's money buying Oculus Rift - but by appearing at a Samsung event and evangelising about its potential he gave a rocket-powered boost to his host's efforts in this field.  He told us how he started sketching out what seemed an unlikely vision of virtual reality from the age of 11 (which young geek didn't?) but that it was now beginning to happen.  "VR is the next platform where anyone can experience anything they want," he said."It's going to change the way we live and work and communicate."  He pictured sitting at a virtual campfire with friends around the world, watching a movie together, or sharing his baby's first steps with a 360 degree view. And of course this would become the future of social media, and Facebook - along with Samsung - would be at the heart of it.  So, an event about a couple of new phones had become a kind of TED talk about a transformational technology. What a win for Samsung, still the world's leading smartphone maker but being squeezed by Apple at the high end and cheap but very capable Chinese smartphones at the budget end of the market.  Like many others in this industry it is trying to look beyond smartphones for its growth, as profit margins get ever slimmer. Making money from its major investment in virtual reality will take time - the company is giving away a Gear VR headset to anyone who orders one of the new Galaxy S7 phones in advance.  But, with the help of Facebook's founder, Samsung managed to change the conversation about the company last night and make itself look more far-sighted than many of its rivals.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35627453	MWC 2016: Sony Xperia puts AI assistant in owner's ear	Sony has announced an earpiece that puts a virtual assistant in one of its owner's ears.  It brings smartphone technology closer to the artificial intelligence experience depicted in the movie Her.  However, Sony will need to overcome the public's resistance to wearing Bluetooth headsets.  The Japanese company also unveiled smartphones that it says are the first to have technology that extends the lifespan of handset batteries.  It announced the new devices on the first day of the Mobile World Congress technology show in Barcelona.  Sony ranks outside the world's top 10 bestselling smartphone brands. It suffered a 27% fall in its smartphone shipments last year, according to market research firm IDC.  The manufacturer is not trying to increase sales by cutting prices in a bid to stop its mobile division losing money.  However, some analysts have questioned whether that approach makes sense.  Sony said the Xperia Ear was part of a plan to extend the Xperia brand beyond tablets and phones.  The device features a proximity sensor that informs a wirelessly linked Android smartphone when it is in the user's ear.  An app on the phone then provides location and time-based prompts about the weather, diary appointments, social media posts, missed calls and the news.  It can also respond to voice commands for internet searches, navigation directions and message dictations.  The idea is to free users from having to handle their phone so often.  Its battery life is limited to three-and-a-half hours of active use, but Sony suggests this will be enough for most people most days.  Other firms, however, have struggled to popularise the concept.  Motorola launched the Moto Hint Bluetooth earbud last year, which provides a more limited range of voice-based controls. It remains a niche product.  One expert said Sony's device seemed a more "interesting attempt" to free up people's hands and eyes, but added there were still challenges to overcome.  "To be attractive to large numbers of users the voice processing will need to be excellent and it will need to work with a wide range of apps and functions on the phone," said Martin Garner from the CCS Insight consultancy.  However, Ian Fogg of IHS Technology was more sceptical.  "Android smartphones already have the Google Now service, so what Sony has to do is work out how it can do something different via voice control," he said.  "Then it has to make sure that it complements Google's software. It's similar to the challenge that all Android handset have when they make their own email, browser and camera apps - it results in there being more than one way of doing the same thing on a device and that can confuse consumers."  The company also announced three smartphones as part of its new Xperia X series, which feature different types of processors and display resolutions depending on their price.  All have adopted a new battery technology developed by Qnovo, a Silicon Valley-based start-up.  "It scans the condition of the battery - sees its temperature and the condition of usage - to see its health level, and then optimises the charging to not damage the battery," a Sony spokesman said.  That meant the batteries should last twice as long before failing to retain a decent charge, he added.  This should appeal to the growing numbers of consumers who go two years or more between upgrades, Sony said.  Another new feature is a technology dubbed "4D focus", which the company says allows the new handsets' cameras to lock onto objects twice as quickly as its Z5 phones.  "There's been a feeling that unless Sony can come up with a truly innovative, stand-out smartphone, there would be serious question marks around the future of the company's mobile business," he said. "In our view, the new smartphones do not break significant new ground."  A year ago, Sony's chief executive Kazuo Hirai told the BBC that there was "no guarantee" it would still be in the smartphone business by 2020 if its mobile division continued to make losses.  Last quarter, the unit reported a 24.1bn yen ($214m; £150m) profit despite shipping 36% fewer handsets than during the same three months a year before.  The company said moving to a line-up from which it made more money per device was behind the profit.  But Mr Fogg said he was unsure whether the approach was sustainable.  "We predict that shipments will continue to fall in 2016 and 2017," the analyst said. "Smartphones are a scale business - it's normally easier to be profitable if you sell high volumes. So, the question is whether Sony can stay profitable if its sales fall further."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35625058	MWC 2016: Samsung Galaxy S7 restores expandable storage	Samsung's latest flagship phones restore a couple of popular features dropped from the previous generation.  The Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge both accept MicroSD cards, allowing their storage to be expanded, and can also be submerged underwater.  In addition, they feature new gaming tech and a rear camera that should cope better in low-light conditions.  Their overall design, however, is similar to the Galaxy S6 line-up.  Some experts suggested that could pose a challenge.  "Although there are significant improvements under the bonnet with the camera, the chipset, the removable storage and the water resistance, Samsung will have to make sure that's visible to consumers," commented Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy.  "Because at a glance they look to be the same as last year's model."  Samsung does not disclose smartphone sales numbers. However its share of the market dropped by 2% in 2015, according to research firm IDC, at a time when Apple, Huawei and Xiaomi made gains.  Even so, IDC's data still indicates the South Korean firm remains the bestselling brand by a wide margin.  The new devices were unveiled in Barcelona on the eve of the Mobile World Congress tech show.  While the Galaxy S7 retains the same sized screen as the S6, the S7 Edge's display has grown slightly from 5.1in (13cm) to 5.5in (14cm).  The Edge version is also slightly curvier than before and its camera protrudes less far out.  In addition, the "edged" parts of the screen now provide shortcuts to email, different photo modes and third-party apps.  They also feature processors that are faster than before and capable of supporting the Vulkan API (application program interface).  This is an open standard that lets games make more efficient use of a chip's graphics processing units (GPUs). Modern PCs and games consoles can already support Vulkan, but Samsung says its smartphones are the first to do so.  The firm has also added a "thermal spreader" to the phone's innards. This is a 0.4mm-deep band of water that turns to steam, cooling down the processor, when required.  It should allow the handset to better handle graphics-intensive titles without overheating.  In addition, Samsung has made it easier to record gameplay for later playback.  The new rear camera introduces two innovations.  Firstly, it has a bigger aperture of f/1.7 rather than f/1.9. This means the lens lets in nearly double the amount of light than before. The pixels are also slightly bigger, which should mean the phones are more capable at taking low-light photos without the need for flash.  Secondly, its sensor is the first on a smartphone to feature "dual pixel autofocus".  This means each pixel can be used to both record the image and determine focus rather than just one or the other. This enables the phone to lock focus to an object more quickly for stills, and deliver smoother focus tracking in video mode.  The technology was first developed by Canon, and until now was limited to the Japanese firm's DSLR (digital single-lens reflex) and Cinema cameras.  "It's not easy to explain or even show off at the point of sale, and that's something Samsung will struggle with," commented IDC analyst Francisco Jeronimo.  "But I believe those users who start using it will quickly realise it does make a difference and will help them get better pictures."  One consequence of adding the new technologies is that the camera's resolution has had to decrease from 16 megapixels to 12MP.  The South Korean firm also introduced a 360-degree camera that can film footage for playback on its virtual reality headset.  The Gear 360's interactive pictures and videos can also be uploaded to Facebook and YouTube.  The device is only compatible with the firm's own handsets. That contrasts with a similar camera unveiled by LG that works with both Android and iOS phones.  One analyst suggested such kit could "add a new dimension" to weddings and other big occasions.  "These cameras will allow users to easily create their own 360-degree content, and this will help fuel demand for virtual reality accessories and broader acceptance of the new types of photos and videos," said Ben Wood from CCS Insight.  One company watcher suggested it was a "no brainer" to pick the new phones over the Galaxy S5 and earlier handsets, but a harder sell when compared to the S6 range.  "I wonder if Samsung will leave the last-generation phones in the market at a lower price - which is normally what it does - or if it will take them away and leave the S5 going to discourage people from buying the cheaper option," mulled Carolina Milanesi from Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.  "Samsung has a problem that is actually shared by most smartphone companies today.  "Each year's phones look more and more alike and what gets tweaked is more of a finesse to what's inside, and that's really hard to convince customers to pay extra for in stores."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35627166	HTC's VR headset will cost more than Oculus Rift	HTC has revealed that its virtual reality headset will cost $799 (£554) and become available towards the start of April.  The Vive was originally supposed to launch in 2015.  It is now set to begin deliveries a few days after Facebook's rival Oculus Rift, which is $200 cheaper.  One expert said consumers were suffering "sticker shock" from both prices, to which they must add the cost of a powerful enough PC.  "It's going to be very difficult to make a judgement as to whether the Vive is worth the extra $200 until we see the range of games it is launching with," said Ed Barton from the tech consultancy Informa.  "Oculus's cost already put the Rift firmly into enthusiast territory, so I think it will be difficult to create any substantial market at an even higher price, which HTC needs to do if it is to build up an ecosystem around its device."  The price comparison, however, may not be totally fair.  HTC has said that its price tag includes two bundled controllers. The Rift's controllers will not become available until some time after June and their price has yet to be disclosed.  HTC also revealed that it would include two games as part of its deal:  The Taiwanese firm made the announcement in Barcelona ahead of the start of the Mobile World Congress tech show.  It also said that it would begin accepting pre-orders in a week's time.  Many people who have tried both headsets believe that the Vive has the potential to offer a superior experience.  Unlike the Rift, it includes a camera system that allows the wearer to see real objects close to them, helping them to avoid bumping into furniture.  By pressing a button on a handheld controller, the objects appear in ghost form, superimposed onto the virtual reality environment.  The Vive has been developed in conjunction with Valve, a US firm whose Steam platform is one of the most popular ways to buy games online, which should give it another advantage.  Even so, many are predicting that Sony's more basic PlayStation VR could become the most popular of 2016's headsets if the Japanese company makes it cheap enough.  "But Sony may have to sell its hardware at a loss to begin with and try to make it up via volume, game sales and licensing revenues over the lifespan of the device."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35625669	Profile: Boris Johnson	Boris Johnson's decision to campaign for Britain to leave the EU is being regarded as a huge boost for the Out campaign.  The 51-year-old London mayor has spent more than a decade combining the gravitas of his various roles with an unkempt, humorous persona rarely seen in modern public life.  Prime Minister David Cameron expressed his delight when Mr Johnson announced his decision to run for parliament again in 2015, saying: "I want my star players on the pitch."  But now the MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip has said he will campaign against the PM in the EU referendum, relations between the two may become more tense.  The big question is whether the blond-haired old Etonian wants simply to play for the team or to captain it.  He has arguably the highest profile of any Conservative except Mr Cameron and is thought by many to harbour an ambition to be prime minister.  When he beat Labour's Ken Livingstone to become London mayor in 2008 it was the Tories' first high-profile election success since before Tony Blair's triumphant entry into Downing Street in 1997. He defeated Mr Livingstone again in 2012, giving him even more of a winner's aura.  The hoopla surrounding Mr Johnson broke out again when he ended months of speculation by confirming he would try to return to the Commons as MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip.  He swept into the safe Conservative London seat in the 2015 general election, taking a spot at the cabinet table as minister without portfolio.  Given the opportunity to enter Downing Street on a fortnightly basis, cycle helmet in hand, was seen as recognition for his unique rapport with voters.  But crucially he is not bound by collective cabinet responsibility, giving him the freedom to rebel against controversial decisions without having to resign.  Although lauded by Conservative activists for his witty speeches, Euroscepticism and lack of PR polish, Mr Johnson's political life has not been blemish-free.  In 2004 he had to make a visit to Liverpool to apologise for an article in the Spectator magazine, which he then edited. It had criticised the people of the city for their reaction to the death of Ken Bigley, the British contractor taken hostage and killed in Iraq.  The following month he was sacked by Conservative leader Michael Howard for failing to tell the party the truth about claims he had an affair.  He created media hysteria at the 2006 Conservative Party conference when he attacked healthy eating advice advocated by the chef Jamie Oliver. He said he would like to "get rid of [him] and tell people to eat what they like".  Later he provoked anger by describing Portsmouth as "too full of drugs, obesity, underachievement and Labour MPs" and associating Papua New Guinea "with orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing".  The London mayor's life has been as exotic as his use of language.  Alexander Boris de Pfeffel Johnson was born in New York and he held US citizenship until 2006. Descended from Turkish, French and German stock he describes himself as a "one-man melting pot". His great-grandfather, Ali Kemal, briefly served as an interior minister in the Ottoman Empire.  The son of a diplomat and Conservative Member of the European Parliament, he was educated at Eton College, where he was senior to Mr Cameron. There is said to be a sense of resentment on Mr Johnson's part at being overtaken by his younger rival.  At Oxford University, Mr Johnson, who flirted briefly with the centre-left Social Democratic Party, was President of the Union. After only a week as a trainee management consultant he moved to journalism. Fired from the Times for making up a quote, he then worked for the Wolverhampton Express and Star before joining the Daily Telegraph, working as its Brussels correspondent and assistant editor.  In his seven years as MP for the ultra-safe Conservative seat of Henley from 2001 he did not make the shadow cabinet, becoming a party vice-chairman and holding roles as a junior spokesman on education and culture.  His decision to run for London mayor in 2008 added excitement to the contest. However, during the campaign he made a conscious effort to avoid giving reason for accusations of eccentricity. Most Londoners seemed to approve, as he beat Mr Livingstone by 54% to 47%.  Days after his victory he banned alcohol consumption on public transport. A keen cyclist himself, he launched a central London bicycle hire scheme, known colloquially as "Boris bikes", and ditched the "bendy bus" in favour of a new generation of double-deckers.  Although suffering a series of high-profile resignations from City Hall, it was Sir Ian Blair's departure as the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which attracted most controversy. Sir Ian said he was stepping down because of a lack of support from Mr Johnson.  He was in charge when riots hit the capital in the summer of 2011. Initially criticised for taking too long to return from a holiday, he was later praised for his handling of events, including making tours of the affected areas.  Mr Johnson also represented the city when it received its greatest publicity in decades, during the 2012 Olympics. His speeches were well received but he was a little embarrassed when, at one promotional event, he became caught on a zipwire, to the delight of photographers.  In 2011 he told the BBC's Newsnight he did not expect to do "another big job in politics" after leaving the mayoralty. This was not universally accepted at face value.  Mr Johnson has arguably fuelled speculation about his ambitions by continuing to make speeches touching on issues beyond his remit in London, in particular on Europe.  His latest decision means that speculation is likely to continue.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35625037	'Conflicted' Boris Johnson expected to back EU exit	Senior Conservative MP and London mayor Boris Johnson will announce he is to campaign for Britain to leave the EU, the BBC understands.  His decision comes as ministers began campaigning over the UK's EU membership, after PM David Cameron called a referendum for 23 June.  The BBC's Norman Smith said Mr Johnson, previously thought to have been "conflicted", had now made up his mind.  The MP is expected to reveal his decision later on Sunday.  He will give the reasons for his decision in his column for the Telegraph newspaper, which is expected to be published at 22:00 GMT, according to a count-down on the paper's website.  The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, said it would be a "big blow" to Number 10.  The Conservative candidate to be the next mayor of London, Zac Goldsmith, will also vote to leave the EU, his team has confirmed.  Mr Cameron has said he will campaign to remain in a "reformed" EU, but six ministers who attend cabinet have joined the leave campaign.  Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if he wished to send a message to Mr Johnson, the prime minister said he would "say to Boris what I say to everybody else".  "We will be safer, we'll be stronger, we'll be better off inside the EU.  "If Boris and if others really care about being able to get things done in our world, then the EU is one of the ways in which we get them done."  Referring to two other prominent supporters of the leave campaign, Mr Cameron also warned against "linking arms with Nigel Farage and George Galloway".  Earlier on the Marr Show, UKIP leader Mr Farage said he would "absolutely" like to see Mr Johnson come out in favour of leaving the EU.  "He's one of those half a dozen people that reaches out to a large number of voters. We'd love to see 'Bo Go' as the headline tomorrow."  Mr Johnson's sister, the writer Rachel Johnson, told Sky News's Murnaghan programme that her brother was not "milking his decision for maximum publicity".  She said: "It's a very, very hard choice that he has to make. It's a hard choice for everybody to make, because there are good and bad arguments on both sides."  Asked if he was "on the horns of a dilemma", she agreed, saying it was "agonising" for him.  Ms Johnson's refusal to give away what her brother might have decided led the Sun's Westminster correspondent, Harry Cole, to tweet about her "poker face".  House of Commons leader Chris Grayling told the BBC's Sunday Politics programme that he hoped Mr Johnson would join the campaign to leave the EU, adding: "I know no more about his intentions than anyone else."  Downing Street has been resigned to Mr Johnson campaigning to leave following a meeting this week which left him disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans on the EU, says BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.  Mr Johnson has also discussed the referendum with Justice Secretary Michael Gove, one of those to declare support for the leave campaign.  The Sunday Times reported that Mr Johnson, thought to have been undecided earlier, had told a Westminster colleague: "I'm veering all over the place like a shopping trolley."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35625057	MWC 2016: Huawei unveils MateBook Windows 10 tablet	Huawei has announced its first Windows 10 tablet, at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.  The MateBook is designed to be an alternative to laptops and is thinner than Microsoft's rival Surface Pro 4 thanks to its use of a USB-C port.  The Chinese firm is already the world's third-bestselling mobile phone-maker, but until now had only made tablets powered by Android.  Experts said it made good business sense to expand into the new category.  However, there was no mention of the much-rumoured P9 smartphone at Huawei's event.  When questioned about the no-show, the firm told the BBC it did not discuss future products.  The MateBook features a 12in (30.5cm) display and can be clipped into an add-on keyboard and used with a stylus.  Its advantages over Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 are that it is:  However, the disadvantages are that Huawei's machine is only offered with a sixth generation Core M processor, and not Intel's more powerful Core i5 or i7 chips.  In addition, the decision to rely on a USB-C port means that older peripherals cannot be attached directly to the machine and it lacks a built-in display port.  In order to gain USB 2 and external display connections, users will need to carry an adapter, which also includes an ethernet port. The tablet does, however, have a built-in SD memory card slot.  One other unusual feature about the machine is that its stylus includes a laser pointer at the opposite end to its nib.  One company watcher said he was "totally underwhelmed" by the product, but said he could understand why it had been developed.  "I expect that Huawei will receive contributions to its marketing costs from Intel and Microsoft," said Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.  "Both of them will want to go to great lengths to help it promote the product, and that takes out some of the risk for Huawei.  "I should add that it has also been beautifully engineered. But even so, this is a segment of the market that is getting very crowded very quickly with Lenovo and Samsung also having recently announced similar products."  Apple also put its iPad Pro on sale in November, which likewise has a stylus and clip-on keyboard but still uses the firm's mobile iOS operating system.  PC shipments are forecast to fall further this year - research firm Gartner has predicted they will decrease by about 1% - and tablet shipments as a whole are expected to see an even steeper drop.  But the so-called "detachable tablet" category, which includes the MateBook, is growing.  Sales were up 75% in 2015 and are forecast to double again this year, according to market intelligence firm IDC.  "It's a product category that we are going to see more people get involved in as it's a good way for the mobile players to attack the PC market," commented Tim Coulling, an analyst at the tech consultancy Canalys.  "But the thing is, Microsoft Surface Pro benefits from the company's brand name and also makes use of the firm's business-to-business sales channels."  These are things where Huawei's MateBook could be at a disadvantage, he added.  The entry-level MateBook will cost $699 (£485) when it goes on sale later this year, making it $100 cheaper than the basic Surface Pro 4.  To purchase its keyboard, MatePen and MateDock will cost an additional $277.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35623823	MWC 2016: LG G5 smartphone has modules to add functions	LG has announced a modular smartphone that can gain extra functions via add-on parts.  Components are plugged in by pulling off the base of the G5 phone and swapping it for an alternative unit.  Google is known to be working on a modular phone of its own, but the concept is far from mainstream.  One expert said the idea would help LG stand out from its rivals, but added that it was too soon to know whether it would turn around the firm's fortunes.  The firm also announced new virtual reality kit and a remote control robot at its Mobile World Congress press conference in Barcelona.  In January, LG reported that its smartphone shipments had fallen by 2% in 2015 despite the market as a whole growing by about 10%.  LG revealed two optional modules - which it calls "friends" - alongside the new mobile handset.  One is a 32-bit digital to analogue converter (DAC) made by the audio specialist Bang & Olufsen, which it says makes the phone capable of playing sounds at a higher resolution - meaning music should be more detailed when heard via good quality headphones or speakers.  The other module is a camera controller that the company says should make it easier for owners to take pictures using only one hand. It features a dial for zooming and a button to take photos among other controls, and also provides a 40% boost to battery life.  A spokesman for LG told the BBC its engineers were working on further modules, and it hoped other third-party manufacturers would also add to the ecosystem.  Switching between modules involves pulling out the phone's battery and attaching it to the new part. Although this makes the action more fiddly, it does have the benefit that the battery can be easily replaced, unlike in many other handsets.  Another unusual feature about the phone is that it comes with two camera lenses on its back.  One is a normal lens, while the other creates 135-degree wide-angled shots that LG says offer a larger field of view than the human eye or any other smartphone.  This can be useful for capturing landscapes or group shots of people. However, the wide-angled photos only have a resolution of eight megapixels - half that of those taken via the other lens.  The phone also has an "always-on display", which uses part of the screen to show the user the time and notifications without them having to wake it up. Despite its name, the display does turn off when the handset detects it is in a pocket.  LG has also followed Samsung in launching its own virtual reality kit.  Unlike its domestic rival's headset, LG's 360 VR does not use the phone as a screen but rather features two built-in displays of its own - one for each eye.  The advantages are that the machine:  LG has yet to announce its price, but has acknowledged that it will be more expensive than Samsung's.  The company also showed off a handheld camera that can capture 360-degree videos, which can be watched on any VR headset or uploaded to Facebook and YouTube.  Unlike the headset, the camera will be compatible with all phones running Android 4.2 or higher or Apple's iOS system.  The final accessory unveiled at MWC was a robotic ball with a built-in infrared blaster.  This can be controlled from afar by the smartphone, allowing the user to see and talk to people in their home and control IR-equipped appliances.  LG was relatively late to the smartphone market, only launching its first Android handset at the end of 2009.  It is currently the world's sixth best-selling smartphone brand, according to IDC.  However, the research firm's data indicates that LG's market share dropped from 4.6% to 4.2% over the course of 2015.  That suggests recent attempts to make itself stand out - including offering leather-clad phones and models with curved screens - have failed to resonate with as many buyers as hoped.  One company watcher, however, suggested that the G5's standout feature had more promise.  "There's very few examples of expandable modules in handsets - Handspring had the Springboard expansion slot [in 1999] for its PDAs, and of course more recently there's Google's Project Ara," said Ian Fogg from the IHS Technology consultancy.  "What's striking is that the idea is against the main thrust of the market, which has been to integrate everything, even the battery, into the phone so nothing is removable.  "But there's a lot of potential. If you can make a phone where the hardware is versatile you open up more opportunities for innovation - not just for what you build, but potentially for what others build too."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35621079	EU referendum: Cameron sets June date for UK vote	The UK will vote on whether to remain in the EU on Thursday 23 June, Prime Minister David Cameron has said.  The prime minister made his historic announcement in Downing Street after briefing the cabinet.  He said he would be campaigning to remain in a reformed EU - and described the vote as one of the biggest decisions "in our lifetimes".  Ministers immediately divided up into the leave and remain camps as the campaigns got under way in earnest.  The referendum date announcement comes after renegotiations on the UK's relationship with Europe were finalised on Friday night after intense wrangling at a two-day summit in Brussels.  The agreement, which will take effect immediately if the UK votes to remain in the EU, include changes to migrant welfare payments, safeguards for Britain's financial services and making it easier to block unwanted EU regulations.  Some Conservative MPs have announced their intention to back the prime minister. The Labour Party, SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Lib Dems are also in favour of staying in.  But many Conservatives have announced they will back the leave campaign including Mr Cameron's long-time ally, Justice Secretary Michael Gove.  London Mayor Boris Johnson, who has previously been a Eurosceptic, has yet to declare where he stands.  On Sunday, he is expected to confirm he will campaign for out, but has told friends he is genuinely conflicted, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says.  Number 10 is resigned to him opposing them following a meeting this week, at which he was disappointed with Mr Cameron's plans, our editor adds.  Mr Johnson has also discussed his decision with Mr Gove.  According to the latest opinion polls, the British public are thought to be fairly evenly split.  Despite the polite promises of civilised debate, Mr Cameron is risking the unity of his party with the referendum.  Cabinet ministers like Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Gove, finally allowed to speak out today, rushed straight from Downing Street to work the phones for one of the leave campaigns.  The gang of six who posed awkwardly for photographs could well become seven when Boris Johnson breaks his continuing silence.  But whatever the individual calculations, expressions of opinion on either side are dwarfed by what today's announcement finally confirms - that in 123 days British voters have the chance to choose to step away from one of the institutions that has shaped our laws, and all of our lives, for more than 40 years.  In his statement, Mr Cameron warned that leaving the EU would be a "leap in the dark" as he urged voters to back his reform deal.  "The choice is in your hands - but my recommendation is clear. I believe that Britain will be safer, stronger and better off by remaining in a reformed European Union."  Home Secretary Theresa May said the EU was far from perfect but "for reasons of security, protection against crime and terrorism, trade with Europe, and access to markets around the world" it was in the national interest to remain in.  Mr Gove said it had been the most difficult decision of his career to go against the prime minister, but he believed "our country would be freer, fairer and better off outside the EU". He added: "Far from providing security in an uncertain world, the EU's policies have become a source of instability and insecurity."  Commons leader Chris Grayling, another leave campaign backer, said: "I actually believe the EU is holding this country back. We cannot control our borders, limit the number of people who come here do trade deals.  "I do not believe we can take decisions in the national interest when we are part of the European Union."  He said the prime minister had "put in a Herculean effort to try to deliver change" to Britain's relationship with the EU, but the "concessions" he had brought back from Brussels did not "give us the opportunity to take decisions in the national interest" without consulting Brussels.  Culture Secretary John Whittingdale, Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers and Employment Minster Priti Patel, who is not a full cabinet member but attends meetings, have also joined the leave campaign.  Energy Minister Andrea Leadsom - who is not a member of the cabinet - will also back the leave campaign.  The rest of the cabinet joined Mr Cameron in the remain camp, including Business Secretary Sajid Javid - previously seen as a potential leave supporter.  The UK held a referendum in 1975 shortly after it joined the EU. The vote was in favour of staying in, but there have been growing calls from the public and politicians for another vote because, they argue, the EU has changed a lot over the past 40 years.  The organisation has extended its control and now sets rules in a wide range of areas - including on the environment, transport and consumer rights.  David Cameron initially resisted calls for another vote, but in 2013 he changed his mind. At the last election he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Europe ahead of a public vote to decide whether the UK should stay in or leave the EU.  Mr Cameron claims his EU reform deal will give Britain "special status" within the bloc - tackling concerns over migrants getting "something for nothing" from the benefit system and exempting the country from the EU drive for "ever-closer union".  But critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration or take back powers from Brussels.  UKIP Leader Nigel Farage said: "The 23rd is our golden opportunity, let battle be joined. Mr Cameron keeps on telling us that Britain would be better in a 'reformed Europe'. But he fails to point out that there is no reformed European Union on offer here. The prime minister's EU deal is pathetic."  Britain Stronger in Europe released a campaign video accusing leave campaigners of "utter hypocrisy" for attacking Mr Cameron's deal, claiming that many of them have been calling for the same reforms.  The key points of Mr Cameron's reform deal are:  The Labour Party is officially campaigning for Britain to remain in the EU, although a small group of the party's backbenchers have joined the leave campaign.  Leader Jeremy Corbyn voted for Britain to leave the European Economic Community, as the EU was then known, in 1975 but has since changed his mind, arguing that "it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers".  He branded Mr Cameron's negotiations a "sideshow" aimed at appeasing critics in the Conservative Party and said he had missed an opportunity to protect jobs and "stop the spread of low pay".  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said in a statement the SNP will be "leading the positive case to keep Scotland in the EU".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35620821	EU deal: What will it mean for Cameron at home and abroad?	David Cameron will now begin the campaign that will define his legacy and his time in office.  The battleground for the next four months has been laid out. The prime minister and the "in" campaign will insist that the UK's relationship with the EU has been fundamentally changed, with several key demands met.  But those who want to leave the UK say it is a "hollow deal", that the negotiations were weak in their ambition and Britain has not regained control over its laws or its borders.  They question whether the emergency brake on migrant benefits will have any impact on immigration numbers - and point out that the legislation on this will have to be passed by the European Parliament only AFTER Britain has voted in a referendum.  And the critics whose ambition is to see powers being returned to Westminster will also point out that the UK has not regained the right to over-rule EU laws.  So that is the battleground at home but Mr Cameron had also claimed there "was a big prize for everyone in the room" in fundamentally reforming the EU.  But the other member states did not choose to seize this moment to embrace wider reforms, underscoring that Britain remains exceptional, the outsider.  The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, said the settlement addressed all of the Prime Minister's concerns "without compromising our fundamental values".  For the rest of the EU that was crucial. There was the will to help David Cameron but the other leaders were not prepared to weaken the EU's core beliefs.  Freedom of movement has not been compromised. The march towards deeper integration has not been slowed.  The President of the Commission Jean-Claude Juncker said there would be "no power of veto over the eurozone" - not that Britain was seeking that.  What the French wanted to underline was that Britain would not win any "exceptions to the rules of the EU" - particularly in relation to regulation in the City.  Even so some European leaders are uncomfortable. This deal recognises that there are different layers of integration.  Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said: "There is a risk of us losing sight of the original European dream."  Belgium was greatly exercised that other countries might want to opt out from further integration.  There is an underlying fear of contagion that other countries might seek similar opt-outs, so leading to an unravelling of the EU.  In the end, the political battle will almost certainly not be fought on the details of this deal.  It will be fought over the economic risks of leaving the EU and whether the UK can regain control over its laws and borders.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-33141819	EU referendum timeline: Countdown to the vote	David Cameron has announced a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU - seen as the biggest political decision in decades. Here are the key events leading up to and beyond - the date.  There have been calls for a referendum on whether or not the UK should be in the EU almost since the original referendum back in 1975. click here for the history of calls for another EU vote  In a long awaited speech Prime Minister David Cameron says that if the Conservatives win the next election they would seek to renegotiate the UK's relationship with the EU and then give the British people the "simple choice" by the end of 2017 between staying in the EU under those terms or leaving the EU. His speech comes against a background of polls suggesting UK Independence Party support at 10%. Read full story on the speech.  The European Union Referendum Bill was unveiled in the Queen's Speech. This is the UK legislation required to allow the referendum to take place. It has now cleared Parliament and become law, after the government twice saw off attempts in the House of Lords to lower the proposed voting age in the in-out poll to 16. At the same time as the bill made its parliamentary journey, Mr Cameron was seeking approval from other EU leaders for the reforms he wants to achieve before the referendum can take place.  The first EU summit after David Cameron won an unexpected majority in the UK general election. The summit ended up being dominated by the migrant crisis and Greek debt crisis. But Mr Cameron used the meeting - made up of all the EU's heads of state - to formally set out his aims. Speaking after it, he said he was delighted the process of "reform and renegotiation" of the UK's membership of the EU was "properly under way".  A new group charged with handling issues relating to the EU referendum began its work. Headed by British official Jonathan Faull, it reports to European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.  Some thought this would be the summit that Mr Cameron sealed the deal with his EU counterparts, but that turned out to be a bit premature. Instead EU leaders had their first "frank" discussions about the UK requests including Mr Cameron's attempts to convince sceptical EU leaders to accept his plans to limit benefits for migrants - one of the key sticking points in the renegotiations. European Council President Donald Tusk said the discussions should "pave the way" for a deal by February.  David Cameron says Conservative ministers will be able to campaign to leave the EU while remaining in the government. However, he says this suspension of the normal rules of collective ministerial responsibility will only apply once agreement on a deal with the rest of the EU is reached.  A landmark moment as the European Council publishes a draft blueprint for the proposed changes to the UK's membership of the EU. The document includes a so-called emergency brake on the payment of in-work benefits and powers for the UK Parliament to join with other countries to block EU regulations. David Cameron says the detail needs to be ironed out but the settlement is the best he could have achieved from a "standing start" and is worth "fighting for". Home Secretary Theresa May says the package offers the "basis for a deal" but many Tory colleagues disagree, saying the PM failed to get nearly all the objectives he originally set out in his 2013 Bloomberg speech.  Defending the package in the House of Commons, the prime minister insists it will see powers returned to the UK Parliament in a string of areas and will leave Britain "better and stronger". But the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, who Out campaigners are looking to join their side, says that the PM is making "the best of a bad job" and more guarantees are needed over enhanced sovereignty.  After round-the-clock negotiations in Brussels, David Cameron gets the 27 other EU member states to sign up to a package of reforms. He does not get everything he wanted - he has to water down some of the welfare curbs at the insistence of Eastern European members - but he does get an exemption from "ever closer union" and the four year ban on in-work benefits for new arrivals. He claims the deal tackles the British public's "frustrations" with the EU and ensures the country will never be part of an EU "superstate" - but critics say it does nothing to tackle high levels of immigration and take powers back from Brussels.  David Cameron says the UK's in/out referendum will be held on 23 June this year - as widely predicted. If he had not got a deal on 18-19 February he would have had to to return to Brussels at the end of February for a special summit or wait until the next scheduled gathering at the start of March.  His cabinet colleagues start to come out in favour or against Britain's membership as the rival campaigns kick into top gear.  David Cameron makes a statement to Parliament, allowing MPs to debate the deal he has reached in Brussels and the choice facing the British people in the referendum.  Secondary legislation is due to be laid before Parliament paving the way for a referendum. The Electoral Commission will designate the official Leave and Remain campaigns, which will get access to public funds, a £7m spending limit and TV broadcasts.  The government ruled out holding the EU referendum on on 5 May, the same day as elections to devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and for London's mayor.  But the SNP has argued that holding the EU vote at the end of June will still conflict with Scottish election campaign. Voters in many English local authorities will also go to the polls, making 5 May the biggest set of elections - outside of a general election - for some years.  Britain goes to the polls to answer the question: "Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?"  In the event of a Leave vote, a country can withdraw from the EU two years after notifying the European Council of its intention to leave. However, leaving would still involve "complex and probably lengthy negotiations", a Parliamentary briefing paper concluded. Talks would be held on the future of the UK's relationship with the EU, including whether it could still have access to the single market. Resolving all this could take some time. David Cameron has promised to step down as Conservative leader before the next general election in 2020, meaning that - whatever the outcome of the referendum - this period is likely to be dominated by the race to succeed him.  French presidential elections take place in May 2017. The UK government had been keen to get its EU negotiations wrapped up by this time for fear of Mr Cameron's demands being trumped by French domestic politics, with candidates seeking to win favour at home with a tough stance against the UK. German parliamentary elections take place in September 2017. This was also close to the final date Mr Cameron could have held a referendum - having promised one by the end of 2017	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35620627	EU summit: High stakes and missed meals	Marathon talks have concluded in Brussels between UK Prime Minister David Cameron and 27 other European Union leaders nailing down a renegotiated UK-EU relationship. Mr Cameron will now use the deal to campaign in the UK's forthcoming referendum on whether to stay in the union.  We look at how the talks unfolded.  Arriving at the summit, Mr Cameron tells reporters: "I'll be battling for Britain. If we can get a good deal, I'll take that deal - but I will not take a deal that doesn't meet what we need. I think it's much more important to get this right than to do anything in a rush."  He is reported to have packed three shirts for the conference and to have told his wife and the children that he might not be back for the weekend.  But European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker is upbeat, describing himself as "quite confident" of a deal.  The mood in Brussels is that this is a "now or never" summit - "The mood around town is that people think that if we don't get it solved now, we're never going to solve it," a senior EU diplomat tells reporters.  EU Council President Donald Tusk, chair of the summit, meets Mr Cameron before the official start, warning "this is a make or break summit".  Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite predicts there will be a squall but no fatal storm. "I think everybody will have their own drama and then we'll agree," she tells reporters.  Mr Tusk schedules wrap-up talks over an "English breakfast" for Friday morning and the meeting begins at 17:00 local time (16:00 GMT).  The breakfast triumph looks unlikely after officials confess little or no progress has been made in the first round of talks, which lasted two and a half hours.  "Sometimes, some issues and details that come up at sherpa [preparation] meetings, then disappear. This was not the case: everybody asked about everything," the BBC's Simon Wilson reports.  Downing Street officials say there remain five key areas of difference, including whether child benefit cuts can be applied retroactively and how long any restrictions on in work benefits can last.  Britain and France also push for any deal to include an assurance that this would be a final offer and could not be revisited. One official says there's no "sense that gaps in key issues have narrowed... there's a lot of hard work to do overnight".  A series of bilateral talks begins just before 03:00. Mr Cameron and Mr Tusk continue the talks until 05:30 local time (04:30 GMT).  Proceedings take a surreal turn when one EU official tries to explain the linguistic vagaries of one particular sticking point - the issue of "ever closer union", an EU principle which Mr Cameron questions.  "Every lawyer in Europe agrees 'ever closer union' doesn't mean anything. It's just a nice phrase.  "Only two places share an opposite interpretation - Britain and Belgium. But politically they look at it in opposite ways."  Reuters reports that a senior EU negotiator explains the dilemma is like Renee Magritte's surreal painting Ceci n'est pas une pipe.  "We need to find a common understanding... which reflects on the one hand the legal dimension of it - Ceci n'est past une pipe, you cannot really smoke it... - but it's true, when you look at it, you see a pipe."  Mr Tusk says talks have made "some progress, but a lot remains to be done".  The triumphant breakfast announcement is shelved, with talks resuming at 11:00 local time. For Mr Cameron, this means only three hours' sleep.  Several countries are taking issue with his demand that an emergency brake on in-work benefits for migrants should be in place for 13 years. The emergency brake is to be used when migration reaches "exceptional" levels.  "Eastern European countries, southern European countries, if they come home as prime ministers and tell their parliament that their citizens in Britain are for a long time citizens second class [sic], then they will have difficulties to explain that," says German MEP Elmar Brok.  Summit meals are scheduled and rescheduled as time ticks on with no final agreement.  "The situation is critical," one official says. "The session scheduled for 4pm [15:00 GMT] has just been cancelled and the meeting of leaders has been postponed to dinner at the earliest, and they have been asked to book hotels for tomorrow."  Greece throws a last-minute spanner in the works, saying it wants a curb on migrants over its border with Macedonia or it will not sign any deal.  Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is spotted nipping out for chips.  The EU leaders sit down to a 19:00 meal and a draft deal, which finally gets pushed through.  "Agreement #UKinEU done. Drama over," the Lithuanian president tweets moments after the dinner begins. The curtain has come down on the drama she predicted at the start. Mr Cameron is free to return home, where the next stage begins.	politics

The agreement, reached late on Friday after two days of talks in Brussels, gives the UK power to limit some EU migrants' benefits.  It also includes a treaty change so the UK is not bound to "ever closer union" with other EU member states, he said.  EU exit campaigners said the "hollow" deal offered only "very minor changes".  Mr Cameron is set to the announce the date of a referendum on whether Britain should remain in the EU after a cabinet meeting which is happening at 10:00 GMT - the referendum is widely expected to be on Thursday, 23 June.  Once the date is announced, ministers will be allowed to campaign for whichever side they want - one of Mr Cameron's closest political allies Michael Gove has already been named as supporting the Leave camp. Others, such as Iain Duncan Smith are expected to follow - but a question mark remains over which way London Mayor Boris Johnson will jump.  The key points of the deal are:  The prime minster had to make concessions to get a deal with the leaders of the 27 other EU members.  Mr Cameron had originally wanted a complete ban on migrants sending child benefit abroad but had to compromise after some eastern European states rejected that and also insisted that existing claimants should continue to receive the full payment.  On how long the UK would be able to have a four-year curb on in-work benefits for new arrivals, Mr Cameron had to give way on hopes of it being in place for 13 years, settling for seven instead.  The agreement on renegotiating the UK's EU membership was announced by European Council president Donald Tusk, who tweeted: "Deal. Unanimous support for new settlement for #UKinEU."  German Chancellor Angela Merkel predicted the package of reforms would "elicit support in the UK for the country to remain in the EU".  Mr Tusk said it "strengthens Britain's special status", while EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker described it as "fair".  Mr Tusk added: "We didn't walk away from the negotiating table. We were willing to sacrifice part of our interests for the common good, to show our unity.  "I deeply believe the UK needs Europe and Europe needs the UK. But the final decision is in the hands of the British people."  The ink is hardly dry on the UK's EU deal, but immediately the focus has switched to the substance of what David Cameron has achieved and - possibly an awkward question - how many of his colleagues will argue against him.  The focus will move to whether the prime minister can keep his party politely together during a period of public disagreement.  The ability to restrict benefits to migrants is an important victory for Mr Cameron - ammunition for his argument that he has achieved changes to help reduce the number of EU migrants coming to live and work in the UK.  The proposals are complicated and do not exactly match the promises he made in the Conservative Party manifesto.  But with it - and the other commitments - it becomes harder for his critics to make the case that the agreement is flimsy and will change nothing.  Mr Cameron said he had achieved the reforms he wanted, claiming they would put the UK "in the driving seat" of one of the world's biggest markets and create a "more flexible" EU.  "We have permanently protected the pound and our right to keep it," he added, saying that, for the first time, the EU "has explicitly acknowledged it has more than one currency".  The prime minister said he had also protected Britain from further political integration inside the EU, adding: "Let me put this as simply as I can: Britain will never be part of a European superstate."  Outlining his case to remain "in a reformed Europe", Mr Cameron said "turning our back on the EU is no solution at all".  "We should be suspicious of those who claim that leaving Europe is an automatic fast-track to a land of milk and honey," he added.  "The British people must now decide whether to stay in this reformed European Union or to leave. This will be a once-in-a-generation moment to shape the destiny of our country."  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mr Cameron's deal as a "sideshow" designed to "appease his opponents in the Conservative Party," adding that he had done nothing to protect jobs and fight low pay.  "We will be campaigning to keep Britain in Europe in the coming referendum, regardless of David Cameron's tinkering, because it brings investment, jobs and protection for British workers and consumers," he said.  Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was now "more important than ever" that those who supported Scotland's continued EU membership made the case "as strongly as possible".  Eurosceptics have dismissed the reforms, saying they will not allow the UK to block unwanted EU laws or reduce migration.  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, said Mr Cameron "will now declare victory but it is an entirely hollow one".  UKIP leader Nigel Farage tweeted: "This is a truly pathetic deal. Let's Leave the EU, control our borders, run our own country and stop handing £55m every day to Brussels. I believe in Britain. We are good enough to be an independent, self-governing nation outside of the EU. This is our golden opportunity."  As the EU summit was being concluded, another EU exit campaign, Grassroots Out, held a rally in Westminster.  Conservative MP David Davis said it was time for Britain "to take control of its own destiny", while UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the cross-party campaign was "absolutely united in fighting to get back our democracy".  Mr Farage unveiled former Respect MP George Galloway as a "special guest" at the rally, describing him as a "towering figure on the left of British politics".

Both firms are under scrutiny from governments around the world over concerns about how they operate.  Joe Gebbia, head of AirBnB, and Travis Kalanick, Uber's boss, were keen to play up the benefits of their disruptive models of commerce.  Sharing cars and homes offered great benefits to communities, they said.  Joe Gebbia, founder of AirBnB - an online service enabling travellers to rent private homes instead of staying in hotels - began by asking the TED audience in Vancouver to unlock their phones and hand them to those sitting next to them.  "That sense of panic you are feeling right now is how a host feels the first time they open their home to a stranger," he said.  AirBnB had succeeded, he said, because it was "designed for trust".  He explained that his own first hosting experience was full of distrust, as he feared that the stranger he had invited to spend the night on an airbed in his living room might kidnap him.  "I lay in bed staring at the ceiling, thinking there is a complete stranger in my living room - what if he is psychotic?"  A few years later when Mr Gebbia moved to San Francisco, he took the airbed with him and realised that he could not only make new friends but also help pay the rent.  "The sharing economy is about commerce but it is also about human connections," he said.  The reputation system that allows hosts and guests to rate each other had been a huge factor in its success, said Mr Gebbia.  He said on any given night 785,000 people were either staying in a stranger's house or welcoming one into their home.  However, trust in AirBnB does not extend to the hotel industry, from which the firm is facing increased pressure.  Last year it spent millions of dollars fighting the introduction of tougher laws for people who allow others to rent their homes in San Francisco.  Recently the firm also angered some of its hosts by delisting them with no explanation.  Uber, an app-based booking service for private-hire cars which is not yet available in Vancouver, was described by TED curator Chris Anderson as one of the "most controversial companies on the planet".  He invited its founder, Travis Kalanick, to explain whether he was, as some have suggested, "an evil genius".  Mr Kalanick declined to discuss himself, but focused instead on two of Uber's newer services - UberPool and UberCommute.  Both could play a crucial role in freeing up the roads, offering thousands of people the opportunity to participate in car pools, he said.  UberCommute, which links commuters with neighbours who need lifts, was rolled out in China last September but was being restricted in the US because of rules that prevent drivers being paid more than 54 cents per mile, said Mr Kalanick.  He compared Uber and its history of rows with city regulators to a service that had rolled out early last century.  So-called Jitney buses started appearing in US cities in 1914, offering lifts for a nickel (five cents) a ride.  By 1919 they had been "regulated out of existence" he said.  "It goes back to the lesson of the Jitney. If they had not been taken off the roads would cities now have parks instead of parking lots?" he asked.  Uber is facing scrutiny from regulators around the world as well as threats from drivers who want increased employment rights.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35614335	Tor: 'Mystery' spike in hidden addresses	A security expert has noticed an unprecedented spike in the number of hidden addresses on the Tor network.  Prof Alan Woodward at the University of Surrey spotted an increase of more than 25,000 .onion "dark web" services.  Prof Woodward said he was not sure how best to explain the sudden boom.  One possibility, he said, might be a sudden swell in the popularity of Ricochet, an app that uses Tor to allow anonymous instant messaging between users.  Tor, or The Onion Router, allows people to browse the web anonymously by routing their connections through a chain of different computers and encrypting data in the process.  On his blog, Prof Woodward noted there had not been a similar increase in .onion sites in the history of the Tor network.  "Something unprecedented is happening, but at the moment that is all we know," he told the BBC.  "It is hard to know for certain what the reason is for the jump because one of the goals of Tor is to protect people's privacy by not disclosing how they are using Tor," said Dr Steven Murdoch at University College London.  Another curiosity described by Prof Woodward was the fact that, despite the rise of hidden addresses, traffic on the network has not seen a comparable spike.  He said there was a chance the spike was due to a network of computers called a botnet suddenly using Tor - or hackers launching ransomware attacks.  It could even be the result of malware that might be creating unique .onion addresses when it infects a victim's computer - though there is no evidence yet for this.  Prof Woodward said that he believed a rise in the use of an anonymous chat app called Ricochet - which has just received a largely positive security audit - is the most likely explanation.  Dr Murdoch said this was indeed a possibility but added that the spike could also be the result of someone running an experiment on Tor.  Ricochet uses the Tor network to set up connections between two individuals who want to chat securely.  The app's website states that this is achieved without revealing either user's location or IP address and that, instead of a username, each participant receives a unique address such as "ricochet:rs7ce36jsj24ogfw".  Ricochet has been available for some time, but on 15 February reasonably positive results of an audit by security firm NCC Group were published.  On his blog, Prof Woodward noted that every new user of Ricochet would create a unique .onion address when setting up the service.  That could account for the surge in services, though he admitted 25,000 new users for the app in just a few days would suggest "spectacular" growth.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35615285	Lib Dems blame general election defeat on 'perfect storm'	The Liberal Democrats' general election defeat was the result of a "perfect storm" including the tuition fees U-turn, a loss of activists, a weak Labour Party and an effective Tory strategy, a party review has concluded.  The Lib Dems went from 57 MPs in 2010 to eight in May, triggering the resignation of leader Nick Clegg.  The party's election review said its move into coalition with the Tories had not been "well understood".  It also blamed a "confusing" campaign.  After the Lib Dems joined the Tory-led coalition in 2010, Mr Clegg was made deputy prime minister, with several high-profile ministerial roles taken by Lib Dems.  The review said Lib Dem members agreed the party was right to join the coalition "in the national interest" but said it had "singularly failed at using our new position to garner support, retain and communicate our vision, or maintain a unique offer".  Ditching the party's key pledge to scrap tuition fees "significantly damaged" the Lib Dems' reputation and credibility, the review concluded, saying it was "almost incomprehensible" that 27 MPs voted in favour of an increase despite the "carefully-negotiated" coalition agreement allowing them to abstain.  Other factors blamed for the loss of support were a lack of financial resources and campaigns with differing messages in different parts of the country as well as "ageing members and deflated morale" among activists.  "For some MPs, local leadership took a back seat to the demands of Westminster," it added.  When it came to the general election, the review said no party had a response to the Tories' message warning of a Labour alliance with the SNP, and criticised the Lib Dems' "fast-changing, complicated messages".  The review - carried out by members of the party's Campaigns and Communications Committee - made a string of recommendations to help the party fare better in any future coalition.  These include that Lib Dems should make it clear they will only automatically vote for legislation covered by the coalition agreement, and that the "wider party" should be represented in the negotiations.  Tim Farron, who replaced Mr Clegg as leader, said: "Blame and criticism can provide short term satisfaction, but do nothing for a future vision.  "This report is about setting a way forward, recognising the mistakes we made, and learning from them."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35611763	John McAfee offers to unlock killer's iPhone for FBI	Anti-virus software creator John McAfee has said he will break the encryption on an iPhone that belonged to San Bernardino killer Syed Farook.  Mr McAfee made the offer to the FBI in an article published by Business Insider.  Apple has refused to comply with a court order asking it to unlock the device, dividing opinion over whether the firm should be compelled to do so.  Mr McAfee said he and his team would take on the task "free of charge".  The offer came as Mr McAfee continues his campaign as a US presidential candidate for the Libertarian Party.  "It will take us three weeks," he claimed in his article.  He added that he was keen to unlock the device because he didn't want Apple to be forced to implement a "back door" - a method by which security services could access data on encrypted devices.  Chief executive of Apple Tim Cook had previously said in a statement that the firm did not want to co-operate.  He argued that introducing a back door would make all iPhones vulnerable to hacking by criminals.  Some, including the Australian Children's eSafety Commissioner who spoke to tech website ZDNet, have said that Apple would not have to introduce a back door, but that the firm is only being asked to provide access to a single device.  But Mr McAfee believes that it would be possible to retrieve data from the phone by other means - though he did not give many details of how it would be done.  "I would eat my shoe on the Neil Cavuto [television] show if we could not break the encryption on the San Bernardino phone," he added.  Security expert Graham Cluley told the BBC he was sceptical of Mr McAfee's claims.  "The iPhone is notoriously difficult to hack compared to other devices," he said.  For instance, Mr Cluley cast doubts on Mr McAfee's idea that he could use "social engineering" to work out the pass-code of Farook's locked iPhone.  This is a process by which hackers try to find out login credentials by tricking people into giving them away.  "In a nutshell, dead men tell no tales," said Mr Cluley. "Good luck to Mr McAfee trying to socially engineer a corpse into revealing its pass-code."  "The FBI isn't interested anyway, they want to set a precedent that there shouldn't be locks they can't break," he added.  After a few days of debate over what Apple should do in response to the FBI's request, other tech firms have rallied behind the company's position.  Google boss Sundar Pichai had already expressed his support for Mr Cook and yesterday chief executive of Twitter Jack Dorsey added his approval via a tweet.  In a statement, Facebook said it condemned terrorism and had solidarity with the victims of terror, but would continue its policy of opposing requests to diminish security.  "We will continue to fight aggressively against requirements for companies to weaken the security of their systems," it said.  "These demands would create a chilling precedent and obstruct companies' efforts to secure their products."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35611130	Volvo tries out 'keyless car' app in Sweden	The car manufacturer Volvo is to try out a phone app in Sweden which the firm claims could replace the car key.  The Bluetooth app can control door locks and start or stop the engine, but the firm told the BBC that additional security measures would also be used inside the vehicles.  The app will also let car owners share "digital keys" with others and download keys before renting vehicles.  If next week's trial is a success the app could be launched next year.  Volvo will continue to offer physical keys to customers who want them, the firm said.  The trial will be in partnership with a fleet of hire cars at Gothenburg airport in Sweden.  Potential problems such as mislaid phones and handset battery life are already a factor of modern life, Martin Rosenqvist, director of new tech and services at Volvo, told the BBC.  "If you lose your car key you need to go to a Volvo dealer - if you lose your phone you have to get a new phone. You can acquire a new app on a new phone," he said.  Mr Rosenqvist pointed out that other essential travel items, such as mobile boarding passes for flights, already require battery life to be factored in for the duration of travel.  "Our app has marginal effect on battery life," he said.  The app communicates with "a Bluetooth installation" inside the car, Mr Rosenqvist said, but acknowledged that extra security would be required.  "It is a digital key but there is also a digital lock and they need to communicate with each other in the right sequence," he said.  "Just listening to the phone is not enough," he added, although he declined to comment on what the additional steps would be.  A cybersecurity expert, Professor Alan Woodward, warned however that Bluetooth was "a security conundrum" because the technology was originally designed as a short-range, replacement for cables.  "The security is defined in the standards so as to allow for 'flexibility'," he explained.  "However, this flexibility has a downside in that the developers have to pay attention or they can leave it open to eavesdropping or hijacking.  "It is not difficult to mitigate against the various forms of attack [but] you need to developers to be aware of the threat in order to ensure the mitigation is in place," he added.	tech

Using a camera hooked up to a HoloLens headset, he was able to "teleport" Nasa scientist Jeff Morris to the TED stage.  Microsoft is due to starting selling HoloLens developer units this spring for $3,000 (£2,000).  Some have questioned whether the technology will appeal to the mass market.  Mr Kipman said that AR would eventually replace the computer, smartphone and laptop screens we currently use.  "We will look back at this decade as being like cavemen in terms of technology," he said.  "Machines are becoming capable of understanding our world and interacting with us."  That, he said, will ultimately lead to a world where the real and the digital are merged seamlessly.  "We will turn a dial and get reality and turn it the other way and get virtual reality."  In his demonstration at TED he showed delegates an other-worldly garden and digital rain before "teleporting" Mr Morris, who appeared to be standing on Mars.  "I'm in three places. I'm in a room across the street, I'm on the TED stage and I am also on Mars," said Mr Morris.  Critics have questioned whether HoloLens will be something that consumers will be prepared to pay for.  "I think we're a good few years away from a compelling consumer AR smart glasses solution which has the desirable content and is cheap enough to drive a broader interest in the technology," said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at research firm IHS.  "I see consumer AR as more embryonic than VR and still very much at an experimental stage," he added.  Most activity in AR at the moment is "business-focused using smart glasses for commercial applications," he added.  Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) have been constant themes at this year's TED with a VR theme park being demonstrated, alongside another AR headset from Meta.  Virtual reality film-maker Chris Milk used his TED talk to conduct the world's biggest simultaneous VR experience.  Delegates had earlier been asked to download an app to their smartphones and each of the 1,200-strong TED audience was given a Google Cardboard headset to view a video.  It was a combination of films made by Mr Milk's start-up Vrse - including film shot from a helicopter above New York City and footage from refugee camps.  "We have just started to scratch the surface of the true power of virtual reality," he said.  "It's not a video game peripheral. It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media - and it can change people's perceptions of each other.  "And that's how I think virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35604674	Bitcoin could help cut power bills	The technology behind the Bitcoin virtual currency could help cut electricity bills, suggests research.  A blockchain-based smart plug that can adjust power consumption minute-by-minute has been created by technologists at Accenture.  The blockchain is the automated ledger that underpins Bitcoin and tracks where the coins are spent and swapped.  The plug shops for different power suppliers and will sign up for a cheaper tariff if it finds one.  Accenture said the smart plug could help people on low incomes who pay directly for power.  The smart plug modifies the basic Bitcoin blockchain technology to make it more active, said Emmanuel Viale, head of the Accenture team at the firm's French research lab that worked on the plug.  Instead of just resolving and confirming transaction records, the Accenture work has changed the blockchain to let it negotiate deals on behalf of its owner.  "It's about how we put more business behaviour or logic into the blockchain," said Mr Viale, adding that this essentially embeds a "smart contract" into the digital ledger.  The smart plug prototype works with other gadgets in the house that monitor power use. When demand is high or low it searches for energy prices and then uses the modified blockchain to switch suppliers if it finds a cheaper source.  So far, said Mr Viale, the Accenture system was just a proof of concept, but it could help many people on lower incomes who pay for their power via a meter.  Being able to quickly shift suppliers could save this group more than £660m in the UK annually, suggests Accenture research.  A blockchain-based system that can act on behalf of its owner might also prove useful as the Internet of Things becomes more ubiquitous, said Mr Viale.  Managing many different gadgets might be tricky without a more centralised system, he said,  Martin Garner, a mobile services expert at analyst firm CCS Insight, said blockchains were starting to crop up in many different areas including share trading, fishing rights databases and land registry claims.  They had two chief attractions for the Internet of Things, he said.  "They avoid dependence on any one supplier or ecosystem - some users have concerns about the potential dominance of key internet players creating, for example, the Google-of-Things or the Amazon-of-Things," he said.  "The second attraction is as a way of enabling autonomous trading between things, such as the appliances in your house being set up to re-order supplies from a pre-approved list of suppliers," he added.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35605931	the fibre frontier	In Jessica North's house in York, I'm trying out her new broadband connection.  Its arrival was signalled by a fibre optic cable poked through a hole in the front room wall by a TalkTalk engineer just a few minutes ago. Now the needle on the speed test I'm running on my phone swings further and further to the right and gives me a spectacular reading - 319 Mbps download and an even more astounding upload speed of 243Mbps.  This kind of speed has been made possible by an experiment in York which could spark a change in direction for the UK's broadband strategy. That's certainly the ambition of TalkTalk and Sky, the two firms working with a fibre specialist Cityfibre to roll out a new fast broadband network, designed to reach 20,000 homes in the city.  Anywhere outside York, both firms are dependent for their broadband infrastructure on BT's Openreach division - which they've attacked for delivering a poor service and tying Britain into the wrong strategy. They have lobbied hard to persuade Ofcom that Openreach should be split off from BT, and we will hear the regulator's thinking on that next Thursday.  The York network is designed to demonstrate that fibre to the home - deemed too expensive an option by BT for most of the country - can be rolled out quickly and economically. The Cityfibre team are using a technique called micro-trenching to lay the cable. We watched as they cut a narrow channel down a pavement in the Huntington area of York, moving much faster than would be possible for a conventional cabling operation.  As for the customer, TalkTalk is offering a price of £21.70 a month including line rental for its ultrafast broadband, no more than its standard connection which it buys at a wholesale price from BT Openreach. Jessica North, a young mother with two small children, said the speed was attractive as the family used a number of devices and her husband did a lot of online gaming. But it was the price that was decisive in persuading the family to move from their existing supplier Virgin Media.  Now BT is going down a different cheaper route to the superfast broadband future, relying mainly on Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) where dozens, perhaps hundreds of homes are connected via a copper cable to a fibre hub in a green box by the side of the road. With York's Gigabit City trial only expected to reach about a quarter of homes, most will still be dependent on the FTTC option which offers speeds of up to 78Mbps.  I was surprised to find, however, that BT Openreach has made its own FTTP option available in York - and in the same areas that TalkTalk and Sky are building their fibre network. But that is sold by its arms-length customer BT Retail at a hefty price - about £60 per month including line rental, so I can't imagine people like Jessica North will be snapping it up.  What then can we learn from what's happening in York about the best way forward for our broadband future? At last there is some competition for BT in providing a fast broadband network, which must be good news. But while that £21.70 per month for a raging fast connection sounds great - is it really an economic price for TalkTalk and will it be available elsewhere?  I've seen a suggestion from their joint venture partner Sky that it costs £800 to hook each home up to an FTTP (Fibre to the Premises) service, so it may be a challenge to make profits in York, let alone in more rural areas. And while BT's record in using government money to roll out superfast broadband to rural Britain has been criticised, rivals like TalkTalk and Sky aren't exactly rushing to do the job.  And here's the big question - would the separation of Openreach from BT make any difference to investment in broadband in York or elsewhere? TalkTalk, Sky and some competition experts believe an independent Openreach would have more focus on its customers, and would hence make bigger and better investment decisions.  BT counters that the whole tortuous process of dividing up its business would impede progress at a crucial time in the rollout of fast broadband. It points to other countries - New Zealand, Singapore and Australia - which have tried the same kind of separation as is being proposed here and claims the results in terms of broadband rollout have been either unsuccessful or extremely expensive.  Ofcom's chief executive Sharon White has been weighing up all these rival claims, and we should find out on Thursday what she thinks of them. Whatever the results of her Strategic Review of Digital Communications, we can expect the arguments about Britain's broadband strategy to continue for years.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35583355	TED 2016: The Void offers new taste of virtual reality	A virtual reality theme-park offering a digital alternative to cinemas, bowling alleys and shopping centres is on show at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference.  VR firms such as Oculus and Samsung have concentrated on developing headsets for use at home.  But the Void will open its first entertainment centre in Utah in the autumn.  One expert said the idea of a physical VR park seemed "pretty compelling".  The Void's founder Curtis Hickman wants to open virtual reality parks in "cities all around the world".  "The Void is about creating the most immersive technology, so instead of sitting at your desk, you walk around an environment. It is a tangible world that seems like it never ends," he told the BBC.  "People like to feel that they are somewhere else, and feel the mist in a cave or the heat from a fire - or believe that they are going up in an elevator."  That experience is creating using haptic vests and a backpack alongside the more familiar VR headset.  The version at TED was a bespoke creation that challenged players to solve puzzles as they walked around an ancient tomb.  I have tried a few VR headsets in my time but generally I am very aware that, despite the amazing visions I can see through the goggles, I am basically standing in a room moving my head around in an odd fashion.  Entering the Void was a very different experience and felt like I had finally fulfilled my childhood dream of stepping inside the TV.  There are walls to touch and a stone throne that you are invited to sit on. It all takes place in a small room but the space feels much larger, with corridors that lead to jungles and pools full of sea monsters. You have to pick up virtual torches and when walls crumble you believe that the bricks are falling on you.  Despite believing entirely in the world I entered - and feeling like Indiana Jones - I didn't scream when I met a monster or fall down a pit having failed to solve the problem correctly.  This was partly because I experienced the Void with a partner, who I rather feebly suggested went first around every corner..  But it was also because I remained aware at all times that this wasn't "real".  Had I remained there longer than the 10 minutes it took to complete - and I could happily have stayed inside for hours - I may have started to believe more deeply in my strange new reality.  Coming back to a somewhat grey Vancouver was a bit disappointing and made me wonder about how we are going to cope with reality when such exciting worlds are just a headset away.  The entertainment centres being planned by the Void will offer a range of content and will be family friendly.  "It was a little rough around the edges but still fun and very immersive," she told the BBC.  "It does allow people to get their first taste of VR without having to plunk down cash to buy new gadgets."  Chris Savage, chief executive of video hosting platform Wistia said: "I've not experienced it myself but it sounds like laser tag taken to the millionth degree."  "The challenge will be to build different physical spaces to experience it in," he added.  As virtual reality becomes ubiquitous, he thinks the Void raises questions about how people will react to an alternative reality.  "Is it too real for some people? Do you forget you are a person if your avatar is too real?"  Curtis Hickman joked that, while there was a place for the real world, he preferred the Void.  "I know when I get out I want to go straight back in - it's an adventure that is difficult to have any other way," he said.  He added, on a more serious note, that he hoped the virtual world "would translate into the real world and help people to live their lives even better".

The claims - made by Channel 4 - allege that some bills were wrongly declared in the party's spending returns.  The commission said it would look at bills for two hotels in the Kent constituency.  A Conservative spokesman said spending was all legal and "correctly recorded".  During last year's election UKIP's Nigel Farage lost out in the race for South Thanet seat to the Conservative Party's Craig Mackinlay.  The rules around candidate spending and any potential criminal offence can only be investigated by the police under the Representation of the People Act (RPA) 1983 - not the Electoral Commission.  But while the commission has no powers to investigate or sanction alleged candidate spending offences, it does have powers in relation to national campaign spending.  Kent Police says it will not pursue an investigation over individual candidate spending in Thanet South during the commission's review.  "At this stage the matter will sit with the Electoral Commission. Kent Police officers will liaise closely with the Electoral Commission and investigate if appropriate," a spokeswoman said.  The commission said it would specifically consider whether stays at the Royal Harbour Hotel in Ramsgate and the Premier Inn in Margate, should have been included in national campaign spending or not.  "The investigation opened by the commission today focuses on whether the Conservative Party met their reporting obligations under the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act," a statement said.  The commission's sanctioning powers are limited to a civil penalty of up to £20,000.  The allegations were first made by on 20 January and relate to how much an individual can spend on their campaign during an election.  The commission said that during what was defined as the "short campaign" - which ran from 30 March to 7 May - £8,700 could be spent, plus 6p for every "registered parliamentary elector".  In his blog Michael Crick - the political correspondent for Channel 4 - said the legal expense limit in Thanet South for that period was £15,016.	politics

The captain, Massimiliano Marselli, reported the laser sighting to the control tower at Mexico City.  Alitalia flight AZ4000 was travelling from Havana with the Pope on board, and was preparing to land when the laser was spotted.  No crew or passengers were injured by the beam, the airline added.  "It is usual practice for the control tower to alert the competent, local authorities," Alitalia said.  On Sunday, a Virgin Atlantic flight to New York from London Heathrow Airport turned back following take-off after a laser was shone into the cockpit.  Virgin Atlantic said that the co-pilot reported feeling unwell and the return to London was a "precautionary measure".  Nearly 9,000 incidents involving lasers and aircraft in the UK were reported to the country's Civil Aviation Authority between January 2009 and June 2015.  "This is yet another incident that shows how serious and widespread the issue of laser attacks on aircraft is," said Jim McAuslan, General Secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa), in response to the case involving the Pope's plane.  "Modern lasers have the power to blind and the potential to dazzle and distract pilots during critical phases of flight," he told the BBC.  "Shining a laser at an aircraft is illegal and dangerous and puts all those on board and on the ground nearby at completely unnecessary risk."  Mr McAuslan added that Balpa would like to see greater restrictions on the sale of all but the least powerful lasers.  The Pope has now completed his five-day tour of Mexico.  According to the UK government, laser pointers - also known as laser pens - are those most commonly used against planes. They are usually portable, low-powered battery-operated devices.  Lasers are categorised by strength, ranging from Class 1 lasers - including those used to play CDs - to Class 4 devices - which can be strong enough to cut metal and to medically treat eyes.  The strength of laser pens can vary widely.  Public Health England says it has found laser pointers available to buy with many found to be Class 3 or higher.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35599774	TED 2016: Linux founder not a 'people person'	Linus Torvalds may have created one of the world's most collaborative tools with his open-source operating system Linux - but he actually prefers to work alone.  The software creator gave a rare interview at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver.  He revealed that he did not originally intend to make Linux open-source.  He also admitted that sharing his work was not an easy decision.  "I did not start Linux as a collaborative project, I started it for myself. I needed the end result but I also enjoyed programming," he said.  "I made it publicly available but I had no intention to use the open-source methodology, I just wanted to have comments on the work."  Mr Torvalds was surprisingly open as he was interviewed on the TED stage, revealing that he works at home in an office devoid of noise or distraction.  "It is the most boring office you'll ever see," he said.  "I often work in my bathrobe, and I have to have complete silence."  It may seem surprising for someone credited with kick-starting the open-source movement and running a software empire, but for Mr Torvalds it comes down to personality.  "I am not a people person," he revealed.  Asked what he was like as a child, he said that he had always been a "nerd".  "My sister had to brief me about who family members were. I was more interested in my Rubik's Cube than my younger brother."  He has, he explained, come to learn that having different people involved in a project is important.  "We need the 'people people' who are warm and friendly. I just care about the technology and there are things that I can't do.  "I am not a visionary. I'm an engineer. I'm happy with the people who are wandering around looking at the stars but I am looking at the ground and I want to fix the pothole before I fall in."  Just don't ask him to design a user interface (UI).  "I can't do it to save my life. If I was stranded on a desert island and the only way to get off was to create a pretty UI I would die there," he joked.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35602527	Hollywood hospital pays ransom to hackers	A Los Angeles hospital has paid $17,000 (£11,800) to hackers after its computer systems were taken offline by ransomware.  Systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center had been affected for more than a week.  Staff had been forced to carry out some tasks on paper.  However, the hospital's chief executive Allen Stefanek, said that the incident had not affected the delivery or quality of patient care.  Ransomware is a form of malware which infects a victim's computer, locking it, and demanding that a ransom - often in bitcoins - be paid in order to restore access.  Previously, local news sources had reported that the hackers were demanding a ransom payment of $3.4m - but Mr Stefanek denied this.  "The amount of ransom requested was 40 bitcoins, equivalent to approximately $17,000," he wrote.  "The quickest and most efficient way to restore our systems and administrative functions was to pay the ransom and obtain the decryption key."  All systems currently in use had been cleared of malware and thoroughly tested, he added.  Last year, security firm Kaspersky acknowledged what it said was a "bitter fact" - "unless precautions are taken, victims may not be able to recover their data in any other way than by paying the demanded ransom."  However, when the English county council for Lincolnshire was faced with a £350 ransomware demand last month, it refused to pay.  The council has since told the BBC that all systems have been restored without having to pay off the hackers.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35601035	a plain English guide	Apple chief executive Tim Cook says the FBI's court order to access the mobile phone of San Bernardino killer Syed Farook is "dangerous", "chilling" and "unprecedented".  The FBI says Apple's lack of co-operation is hindering its investigation.  Here's a plain English guide to the debate, and an explanation of what may happen next.  Before we begin, let's establish with the FBI isn't asking for: it doesn't want Apple to break the encryption on the device. Why? Because it can't.  Apple made the conscious choice in 2014 to remove itself from being able to access encrypted devices, mainly to avoid ethical dilemmas like this. So...  Here are the FBI's specific demands, as outlined in court documents.  The FBI wants Apple to alter what is known as a SIF - System Information File. In this context, the FBI is basically referring to the software that runs on the device. The FBI wants Apple to create a new SIF to place on Farook's iPhone that will allow it to carry out several functions normal iPhones do not allow.  The FBI wants to be able to:  As this row goes through the courts, expect that final element to be a key point the FBI makes - it will argue that the SIF will only work on Farook's phone, and will be known only by Apple, who could choose to destroy it.  In a letter to customers, Apple boss Tim Cook said he did not want to introduce what is known in IT security as a "back door". Like a literal back door, it's simply a different way in. In this case, a different way to get into the phone other than by using the passcode, i.e. the front door.  Back doors are a big deal in security. Hackers make their money from finding them - a back door into a major piece of software or popular device can be highly lucrative. Buyers range from criminals to governments looking to spy or obtain data they otherwise wouldn't be able to reach.  Apple says introducing a back door into the iPhone wouldn't just make Farook's phone insecure and accessible to the US government - it would every iPhone inherently weaker.  "You can't have a back door that's only for the good guys," Mr Cook said in an interview in 2015.  "Any back door is something that bad guys can exploit."  Most experts the BBC has spoken to think it is possible to access Farook's phone without harming the data. And significantly, Apple hasn't denied it's possible either, instead choosing to discuss the merits of why it thinks it shouldn't.  An in-depth explanation of how it could be done was posted by security research firm Trail of Bits.  By using the same technique that enables "jailbreaking" - the practice of forcibly removing restrictions and security measures within the iPhone's software - you could force new software onto the iPhone, researcher Dan Guido wrote.  He said that by using security signatures that only it possesses, Apple is capable of creating modified software that would just work on Farook's iPhone.  "This customized version of iOS (*ahem* FBiOS) will ignore passcode entry delays, will not erase the device after any number of incorrect attempts, and will allow the FBI to hook up an external device to facilitate guessing the passcode," he wrote.  "The FBI will send Apple the recovered iPhone so that this customized version of iOS never physically leaves the Apple campus."  On Wednesday, Apple's peers in the technology industry - also eager to keep reputations over security intact - gave their backing to the iPhone maker.  Jan Koum, the creator of Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook, wrote: "We must not allow this dangerous precedent to be set. Today our freedom and our liberty is at stake."  The Information Technology Industry Council, a lobbying group which represents Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Samsung, Blackberry and a host of others, put out this statement: "Our fight against terrorism is actually strengthened by the security tools and technologies created by the technology sector, so we must tread carefully given our shared goals of improving security, instead of creating insecurity."  Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said: "Forcing companies to enable hacking could compromise users' privacy."  Edward Snowden, whose revelations about US government spying provoked Apple's stance on passcode-protected data, said the FBI was "creating a world where citizens rely on Apple to defend their rights, rather than the other way around".  White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Wednesday that the FBI was "simply asking for something that would have an impact on this one device".  The FBI, he said, had the full support of the White House in the matter.  Potential Republican Presidential candidate Donald Trump has said he agreed "100% with the courts".  "We should open it up," he told Fox News.  While much of the technology community has backed Apple's stance, some commentators say the company is framing the debate poorly.  On mic.com, writer Jack Smith argued: "The truth is that there is a protection in place: a warrant.  "We should fight to make warrants difficult to obtain. But the real unprecedented feat is the idea that a corporation like Apple should be able to prevent our law enforcement from carrying out a lawfully obtained warrant."  In the UK, the family of murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby told the BBC Apple was "protecting a murderer's privacy at the cost of public safety".  Apple has a few more days to file its formal response to the court, which can be summed up as: "No."  After a series of briefings at this local level, if neither side is happy, the case will be passed on to the District Court.  The case would then be escalated to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court which handles these sorts of issues on the US West Coast.  If that court backs the FBI, and Apple again refuses, it could eventually reach the US Supreme Court, whose decision will ultimately be final, and in this utterly fascinating case, precedent setting.  That could take several years.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35601110	Apple Pay to be available in China from this week	Apple has confirmed that its alliance with China's state-owned bankcard association, China UnionPay, will allow the lender's cardholders to use Apple Pay from this week.  The union between Apple and UnionPay was announced late last year, but was subject to various approvals.  Shoppers around the world are being encouraged to use smartphones instead of cards to pay for in-store purchases.  Apple confirmed its expansion into China on its website.  "You can now support Apple Pay for your customers in China, providing an easy, secure, and private way for them to pay using their China UnionPay credit and debit cards," the firm said.  Apple's head Tim Cook later announced the launch of Apple Pay in China early on Thursday via his Weibo account.  Several reports have indicated that as many as 20 China-based lenders will be supporting Apple Pay, including the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).  ICBC had not responded to written inquiries on Thursday, however.  There has been a rapid take-up of smartphones in China, with an estimated 68% of the population now owning one - and digital wallets are becoming a more popular way to pay for goods and services.  UnionPay's alliance with Apple is an extension of its plans to make the most of that growing market.  However, analyst Bryan Ma of research firm IDC told the BBC that Apple was likely to garner a smaller user base in China compared to competitors like AliPay and Tencent's WeChat Payment.  "This is in part because Alibaba and Tencent payment systems are used for more things, like money transfers, whereas Apple Pay might be limited to just retail point-of-sale and possibly App Store transactions for now," he explained.  "There will be a natural, gravitational pull though for some people to Apple Pay - particularly people in big cities - because of Apple's brand. So they will be able to attract a selected customer base that way."  Mr Ma said another issue was that Apple Pay would use the Near Field Communication (NFC) method of contactless communication, rather than the barcode-like method of electronic payments using QR codes.  QR codes were widely used by Apple Pay's China-based competitors like Alipay, Mr Ma said, and could reach a wider market because more phones could read them compared to phones that could read NFC tags.  By 2017 it is estimated the global mobile payments market will be worth some $1tn (£650bn).  In addition to Apple Pay, Google's Android Pay is available at more than one million locations in the US, while Samsung Pay was launched in South Korea in August, followed by a launch in the US the following month.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35595840	Lee Rigby's family criticises Apple policy	The family of Fusilier Lee Rigby, who was murdered by extremists in 2013, has criticised Apple for opposing a court order.  On Wednesday, Apple said modifying its software to help the FBI access data on San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook's device would be "dangerous".  Mr Rigby's uncle Ray McClure said the company was "protecting a murderer's privacy at the cost of public safety".  But a number of privacy advocates have backed the company's stance.  In December, Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik were shot after killing 14 people in California.  US officials said Malik pledged allegiance to the so-called Islamic State in a social media post on the day of the shooting.  Apple had been ordered to help the FBI circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contained crucial information.  But the company said it would oppose the court order because it "set a dangerous precedent".  Mr McClure, the uncle of Fusilier Lee Rigby who was murdered by two Islamist extremists in May 2013 , said he thought Apple's approach was "short-sighted".  "Valuable evidence is on that smartphone and Apple is denying the FBI access to that information," he told the BBC.  "If a court issued a warrant in the UK or United States to search somebody's house, you wouldn't stop them, you would allow them in - why should a smartphone be any different?  "If Mr Cook has no sympathy for terrorists, why is he stopping the FBI accessing those phone records?"  In an open letter on Wednesday, Tim Cook said Apple did cooperate with law enforcement.  "When the FBI has requested data that's in our possession, we have provided it," he wrote.  "We have also made Apple engineers available to advise the FBI... we have worked hard to support the government's efforts to solve this horrible crime. We have no sympathy for terrorists."  The company said it would oppose the court order because creating a backdoor in its operating system was "too dangerous".  But Mr McClure said companies were forgetting about the victims of crime, and the families of those killed.  "I would hate to see on the streets of London another murder like what happened to Lee Rigby, I'd hate to see another attack like what happened in Paris," he said.  "How many victims of crime are not getting justice because of Apple's stance?"  "The FBI's request, which would in practice require Apple to rewrite its operating system to weaken security protections, would set a very dangerous precedent," said Sherif Elsayed-Ali from Amnesty International.  "Such backdoors undermine everyone's security and threaten our right to privacy.  "This isn't an issue about reading a known terrorist's texts - it's about how the functionality could be abused in other ways."  Greg Nojeim from the Centre for Democracy and Technology agreed: "If the order stands, Apple and other technology companies could be ordered to build backdoors - essentially defects - into other devices, rendering them insecure and vulnerable to attack by law enforcement and by others as well."  In its statement, Apple said: "The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.  "We can find no precedent for an American company being forced to expose its customers to a greater risk of attack."  Mr McClure said he appreciated the value of encryption but that some companies had taken things too far.  "I'm not saying take encryption off the iPhone, but there has to be a balance," he told the BBC.  "Where there is a legally obtained warrant for information we should be helping the authorities get that information.  "That can also clear an innocent person too, it works both ways."	tech

The X Prize was set up to push the boundaries of technology to solve issues such as climate change.  The winner, which will be announced at TED in 2020, will win $5m (£3.4m).  It will be awarded to the team that is deemed to have used artificial intelligence to solve one of the world's biggest problems.  Other X Prizes include one to put a robot on the moon, which was launched in collaboration with Google and one that aims to design a real-life health tricorder - a digital device that can scan the body and diagnose illness.  AI is often associated with dystopian visions of machines working against humanity and the new prize is partly to re-establish it as a technology capable of doing good.  Peter Diamandis, head of the XPrize Foundation, said that the rules and structure of the competition would be loose because it was such a fast-moving technology. What AI is used to improve will be left up to individual teams.  Every year leading up to 2020, teams will go head-to-head at World of Watson, IBM's annual conference, competing for interim prizes and the opportunity to advance to the next year's competition. IBM is jointly running the prize.  The three finalist teams will take the TED stage in 2020 to deliver talks demonstrating what they have achieved.  Ideas will be evaluated by a panel of expert judges for technical accuracy with the TED and X Prize communities choosing the winner.  More details about the competition will be made available in May.  Interested parties can pre-register at the X Prize website.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35599483	Chinese hoverboard firm counter-attacks US rival	The tables have turned on a US-based hoverboard maker that sued a Chinese competitor for patent infringement.  Future Motion's complaint led to Changzhou First International Trade's products being seized at the CES tech trade show in January.  But the Chinese firm is now seeking $100,000 (£69,900) in damages plus reimbursement of its legal fees after the Californian firm dropped its claim.  Changzhou said there had been no reasonable basis for its rival's case.  Both Future Motion and Changzhou make electric-powered hoverboards that are unusual for having a single central wheel rather than one at each end.  In January, Future Motion's chief executive Kyle Doerkson told the BBC that Changzhou's Trotter product was a "knock-off" of its own more expensive Surfing Electric Scooters.  "We have design and utility patents that cover our invention," he added.  US marshals enforced a restraining order after receiving a complaint from the US firm, which led to the closure of Changzhou's stall at the CES tech show on 7 January.  Footage of the incident was posted online by the news agency Bloomberg and it was widely reported elsewhere.  Changzhou subsequently rejected the allegations, saying a side-by-side comparison of the two firms' products demonstrated that the platform, footpad and tyres designs were "plainly dissimilar to the ordinary observer".  Furthermore, Changzhou said that the actual scope of Future Motion's patents were much narrower than had been indicated and that US firm could in no way could claim the rights to "all one-wheeled, self-balancing vehicles".  Future Motion maintains its claims, dismissing the first of the points as "legal puffery" and insisting that it still believes its intellectual property was infringed.  However, on 4 February it told the court that it wanted to voluntarily dismiss the case.  "We had achieved our goal of preventing [Changzhou's] exhibition at CES," Mr Doerkson told the BBC.  "Looking forward at the cost-benefit of continued litigation to seek an injunction, we decided that that cost benefit did not pencil out for us and that our intellectual property budget would be better spent in other ways."  But Changzhou has since petitioned the judge to re-open the case saying it wants to be reimbursed for "business expenses incurred, lost sales suffered, and reputational damage".  Moreover, the Chinese firm is also demanding Future Motion be forced to issue a press release notifying the public that it had dismissed its original claims.  Future Motion's lawyer told the BBC it plans to formally oppose these demands once Changzhou's legal team has filed some additional paperwork.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35583356	TED 2016: Meta augmented reality headset demoed at TED	An augmented reality headset has been shown off at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference whose makers say could transform computing and communication.  The Meta headset shows digital content superimposed over the user's view that they can manipulate with their hands.  They can also use it to make a phone call and "see" the person in 3D.  However, there remains questions about how willing people will be to wear headsets for such tasks.  Augmented reality layers a digital world on top of the physical one. Some experts believe it has more real-world uses than virtual reality, which separates the user from their real-world surroundings.  The demonstration at TED showcased the capabilities of the Meta 2 development kit.  Meta founder Meron Gribetz said: "We are creating an experience that merges the art of user interface design with the science of the brain, creating 'natural machines' that feel like extensions of ourselves rather than the other way around.  "For example, our natural hand motion doesn't rely on clicks or buttons, thereby maintaining the flow and connecting people to each other and the moment."  It has had an enthusiastic reaction from those who have tried it.  Robert Scoble, an influential futurist at data hosting firm Rackspace, has described it as "the most important new product since the original Macintosh."  Mr Gribetz said he was inspired to create the machine while watching people on their mobile devices in a New York bar. He said he thought that tools that allowed people to see and share content would be preferable to users "hunched over a small rectangle".  "I was thinking about how holograms can replace computers," he explained.  "If we can put a digital layer into the real world imagine what that could mean for storytellers and brain surgeons."  The firm was founded in 2012 and the first Meta prototype was a home-made affair, built with an oven-heated knife, a hot glue gun, and the best components Mr Gribetz could get his hands on.  In five years time he predicts that the headset will have shrunk to the size of a thin piece of glass.  The visor on the headset is see-through, to allow holograms to appear properly anchored to the physical surroundings using positioning tracking, so people using the technology always feel oriented.  The firm has told developers they will be able to obtain units by mid-2016.  Trying Meta feels a bit like being in Minority Report. 10 screens appeared in the either in front of my eyes and I was move them around by poking on screen and lifting it to another place.  Being a policeman of the future is all very well, but more visceral to me was the ability to go onto an Amazon webpage and literally remove a pair of trainers, walk around them, look inside them and even attempt to try them on.  I could see the huge potential of this technology for schools - the human body can be lifted out of a page and turned into a 3D model which you can then pull apart to separate skin from skeleton.  Perhaps the most impressive part of the demo was when I was asked to call one of Meta's employees via a button on the virtual screen.  On answering, he appeared before me as if he was sitting next to me.  Pretending for a moment to be architects redesigning the Sydney Opera House, the building popped up in front of me. It offers huge potential for collaborative working.  But one of the biggest downsides for me was how you handle content. Currently, you have to almost punch it, which doesn't seem all that natural and, on several occasions, I lost control of the objects I was manipulating.  I was told that this will improve over time but it reminds me that, however Iron Man it may seem, the technology is still very much in its infancy.	tech

This may just be it.  The team has created Orion, software which integrates Leap Motion into virtual reality environments.  While the likes of Oculus and HTC's Vive are experimenting with complex, often clunky controllers for VR - Leap Motion's tech allows for an accurate reconstruction of your entire hand.  The software has been released to developers today, and works with existing Leap Motion devices that have already been sold.  Leap Motion chief executive Martin Buckwald told the BBC that it was working with all the major VR makers to embed the device within their headsets.  For now, however, the device rests within a little mount attached to the front of the headgear.  The company hopes the tech will pave the way for innovative new user interfaces, as well as just fun.  After much initial excitement a few years back, Leap Motion has failed to capture the imagination of technology users and sales of the $79 device have been modest.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-32695399	Q&A: What Britain wants from Europe	David Cameron wants to renegotiate the terms of the UK's membership ahead of a referendum by the end of 2017. He has said he will campaign for Britain to remain in the EU if he gets the reforms he wants.  Mr Cameron said he did not want to reveal full details of his negotiating hand before serious discussions get under way.  Through a series of speeches and newspaper articles, he has given an overview of his priorities but, and in November, he set down his objectives on paper for the first time in a letter to Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council.  His four key objectives are:  The Conservatives want to free business from red tape and "excessive interference" from Brussels and to provide access to new markets through "turbo charging" free trade deals with America and Asia.  They also want trade barriers in the services and digital sectors to be removed to create a truly single market as well as specific protections for the City of London.  They support continued enlargement of the EU to new members but with new mechanisms in place to "prevent vast migrations across the Continent".  The prime minister has said Britain would resist any move towards a European Army and that he wants to free British police forces from EU interference. He has also ruled out Britain joining the euro.  But he has placed less emphasis in recent years on demanding changes to EU social policy, such as the maximum 48-hour working week, agency workers, maternity leave and non-discrimination rules - amid pressure from trade unions to leave such protections intact.  The official UK government position is that a referendum will be held by the end of 2017 but Downing Street sources have said: "If we can do it earlier we will." it is widely expected to be held in June or July if a deal is reached at the EU summit in February.  The Conservatives will attempt to repeal the Human Rights Act, which requires UK courts to treat the European Court of Human Rights as setting legal precedents for the UK, in favour of a British Bill of Rights.  The European Court of Human Rights is not a European Union institution. It was set up by the Council of Europe (CoE), which has 47 members including Russia and Ukraine.  David Cameron says that if necessary he would back a new law reasserting the power of the UK Parliament over the EU.  The freedom for people to move around Europe, enshrined in the EU treaties, works in parallel with the other three basic freedoms in the single market: freedom of goods, capital and services. It is a "red line" for other EU leaders, who do not want to see it eroded.  Mr Cameron's decision to seek the four year ban on some UK benefits for EU migrants was a way round it, but a number of EU countries - including Hungary and Poland - say they will not accept anything which discriminates against their nationals.  This has led to reports that the idea of an "emergency brake" to limit numbers when there has been a surge of migrants, might be back on the agenda.  In a speech in November 2014, David Cameron set out measures to reduce the number of EU nationals moving to the UK.  Jean-Claude Juncker, President of the European Commission, has said he is ready to work with Mr Cameron to "strike a fair deal for the United Kingdom in the EU".  But his spokesman reacted to the publication of Mr Cameron's negotiation objectives by warning that restrictions on benefits for new arrivals to the UK would be "highly problematic" as they affected the "fundamental freedoms of our internal market" and amounted to "direct discrimination between EU citizens".  The main sticking point has been opposition from countries including Hungary and Poland to the idea of the four year ban on claiming some UK benefits. The message from the rest of the EU is that there cannot be a policy which discriminates against other EU nationals.  However David Cameron has said he is willing to consider alternatives that have the same impact on migration flows, while his EU colleagues have also said they want to come up with a deal which achieves the UK's aims.  Mr Cameron has faced repeated calls to say whether he would campaign for Britain's exit from the EU in the referendum if he fails to get what he wants from the renegotiation process. All he has said is that he will "rule nothing out" and he has no "emotional attachment" to the EU.  Some Conservative MPs want Britain to leave the EU no matter what David Cameron manages to renegotiate. A larger group are likely to want more concessions than Mr Cameron has so far indicated he is prepared to demand.  Senior backbencher David Davis, who was defeated by Mr Cameron for the Tory leadership in 2005, told the Daily Telegraph the majority of the 332 Conservative MPs want Mr Cameron to negotiate an "opt-out" power to stop individual EU laws from applying to Britain. The prime minister has said this would be "impossible" without Britain leaving the EU.  Mr Davis claims as many as 60 Tory MPs would be prepared to rebel and vote for Britain's exit from the EU if the prime minister fails to deliver.  Graham Brady, chairman of the Tory backbench 1922 committee, which represents backbenchers, had urged David Cameron to give all Conservative MPs, including ministers, a free vote in the EU referendum despite Mr Cameron warning in January 2015 that serving cabinet ministers would have to quit the government if they wanted to campaign to leave the EU - if he had secured the reforms to it he wants.  That position has now changed with Mr Cameron agreeing to allow cabinet ministers to campaign - in a personal capacity - on either side of the EU referendum campaign, once his renegotiation is over.  In the 1975 referendum on whether Britain should remain in the European Economic Community, as the EU was then called, Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson decided to suspend collective responsibility because his cabinet was split on the issue.  Ministers were allowed to vote with their consciences and campaign against each other. The majority of them, including Mr Wilson, joined the Yes camp, but left-wingers, such as Tony Benn, played a leading role in the No campaign. The Yes campaign won easily with 67% of the vote.  Referendum on the UK's future in the European Union  The UK is to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether to remain a member of the European Union or to leave. The vote is being proceeded by a process of negotiations in which the Conservative government is seeking to secure a new deal for the UK.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum	politics

The $1m prize is awarded each year to an individual who is judged able to spark global change.  Dr Parcak is using the money to set up a website to crowdsource as yet undiscovered sites around the world.  The so-called citizen scientists will also be called on to spot and report looting at existing sites.  Dr Parcak is known as a space archaeologist because she uses satellite imagery collected above the Earth and analyses it using algorithms to identify subtle changes that could signal a hidden human-made structure.  Her satellite mapping of Egypt has already suggested the existence of 17 hitherto unknown pyramids, 1,000 tombs and 3,100 settlements.  Each TED prizewinner must articulate how they will spend the money via a "wish". Dr Parcak's is to get the world more engaged in archaeology.  "I wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites across the globe," she said.  "By creating a 21st Century army of global explorers, we'll find and protect the world's hidden heritage, which contains humankind's collective resilience and creativity."  Her website will offer the public access to satellite imagery and tutorials to help spot potential sites.  Users will be asked to fill in a checklist of what they have seen. Although they will be given imagery, they will not know the exact location of the sites they are exploring to prevent possible looting or misuse of information.  "If 50 people say that they have seen a tomb, then we will think that it is worth a look," she explained.  She added that the site would be launched in a game format. Users will be given points and high-scorers could win the opportunity to be involved in digs via social media if archaeologists follow up their discoveries.  "Archaeology is currently at a tipping point," she told the TED audience on accepting her prize.  "Isil is blowing up and looting temples in Iraq and Syria. If we don't do something, these sites will be gone."  The volunteers will also be called on to spot evidence of sites being raided and treasures stolen by locals who are desperate for money.  Dr Parcak's team has spent the last six months looking for looting pits in Egypt, which are distinctive and relatively easy to identify.  She said they had uncovered evidence of excavations across the country where people had tunnelled underneath to steal mummies, jewellery and other valuables.  "We can't keep up, we are losing the battle. It is heartbreaking," she said.  She hopes that by engaging an army of citizen scientists, some of the treasures at the ancient sites in the Middle East can be saved.  "If the platform can detect looting early enough we can alert the authorities and start protecting the site," she said.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35594245	Apple rejects order to unlock gunman's phone	Apple will contest a court order to help FBI investigators access data on the phone belonging to San Bernardino gunman Syed Rizwan Farook.  The company had been ordered to help the FBI circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contained crucial information.  In a statement, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said: "The United States government has demanded that Apple take an unprecedented step which threatens the security of our customers."  "We oppose this order, which has implications far beyond the legal case at hand."  Since September 2014, data on the latest Apple devices - such as text messages and photographs - have been encrypted by default.  If a device is locked, only the user's passcode can be used to access the data. If 10 incorrect attempts at the code are made the device will automatically erase all of its data.  Apple says even its own staff cannot access the data - a move the company made following the Edward Snowden revelations into government surveillance.  The FBI has asked Apple to do two things.  Firstly, it wants the company to alter Farook's iPhone so that investigators can make unlimited attempts at the passcode without the risk of erasing the data.  Secondly, it wants Apple to help implement a way to rapidly try different passcode combinations, to save tapping in each one manually.  The FBI wants to use what is known as a "brute force" attack, trying out every combination until stumbling across the correct one and unlocking the phone.  Farook is understood to have used a four-digit passcode which means there are 10,000 possible combiations.  "The FBI wants us to make a new version of the iPhone operating system, circumventing several important security features, and install it on an iPhone recovered during the investigation," wrote Mr Cook.  "The government is asking Apple to hack our own users and undermine decades of security advancements that protect our customers.  "Opposing this order is not something we take lightly. We feel we must speak up in the face of what we see as an overreach by the US government."  Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the California city last December before police fatally shot them.  "We have no sympathy for terrorists," said Mr Cook.  "We are challenging the FBI's demands with the deepest respect for American democracy and a love of our country."	tech

Farook and his wife killed 14 people in the California city last December before police fatally shot them.  A court order demands Apple help circumvent security software on Farook's iPhone, which the FBI said contains crucial information.  The BBC understands Apple will contest the order.  Since a software update released in September 2014, data on Apple devices - such as text messages and photographs - have been encrypted by default.  It means if a device is locked, only the passcode can be used to access the data. If 10 incorrect attempts at the code are made, the device will automatically erase all of its data.

Farook is understood to have used a four-digit passcode, meaning there are 10,000 possible combinations.  The FBI wants to use what is known as a "brute force" attack: literally trying out every combination until stumbling across the correct one and unlocking the phone.  Apple has yet to respond publicly to the order.  However, a source close to the proceedings told the BBC that Apple will likely contest the demand.  In the past, the company has fought strongly against calls to access users' personal data, saying it would jeopardise the trust it has with its customers.  On its website, Apple says: "For all devices running iOS 8 and later versions, Apple will not perform iOS data extractions in response to government search warrants because the files to be extracted are protected by an encryption key that is tied to the user's passcode, which Apple does not possess."  This latest order is unique in that it acknowledges Apple cannot access the data. Instead, it asks the company to make it possible for police to take a trial-and-error approach.  Other smartphones, including those powered by Google Android, also implement similar encryption technology on their devices.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35592916	Glibc: Mega bug may hit thousands of devices	A major computer security vulnerability has been discovered - with experts cautiously warning it could potentially affect hundreds of thousands of devices, apps and services.  However, due to the nature of the bug, it is extremely difficult to know how serious the problem is.  "Many people are running around right now trying to work out if this is truly catastrophic or whether we have dodged a bullet," said Prof Alan Woodward, a security expect from the University of Surrey.  Google engineers, working with security engineers at Red Hat, have released a patch to fix the problem.  It is now up to manufacturers, and the community behind the Linux operating system, to issue the patch to affected software and devices as soon as possible.  In a blog post explaining the discovery, Google's team detailed how a flaw in some commonly-used code could be exploited in a way that allows remote access to a devices - be it a computer, internet router, or other connected piece of equipment.  The code can also be within many of the so-called "building blocks" of the web - programming languages such as PHP and Python are affected, as well as systems used when logging in to sites or accessing email.  "It's not a sky-is-falling scenario," said Washington D.C-based security researcher Kenneth White.  "But it's true there's a very real prospect that a sizable portion of internet-facing services are at risk for hackers to crash, or worse, run remote code to attack others."  He said that while there is no publicly known attack code using the flaw, it's a "near certainty" hackers would try to exploit the weakness.  The bug is found in glibc - a open-source library of code that is widely used in internet-connected devices.  One particular function is domain look-up. This is when the device converts a typical web domain, say bbc.com, and finds its corresponding IP address so it can access whatever website or service is needed.  The domain look-up code in glibc contains a bug that could allow hackers to maliciously implant code within a device's memory. From here, attacks such as remote execution - controlling the device over the internet - could take place.  However, Google said carrying out such an attack was "not trivial". Google's engineers have discovered a way to exploit the flaw, but are not making it public for obvious security reasons.  The scale of the problem is difficult to determine because it is unclear how many devices and systems make use of the glibc code.  For instance, Google Android devices use a substitute library which is not vulnerable to this particular attack.  But hundreds of thousands of others could be, and so manufacturers are being urged to test their systems using a proof-of-concept attack developed and released on Tuesday by Google's team.  Major systems like Windows or OS X are unaffected - but consumers need to be more concerned about about smaller connected devices.  "Think routers and increasingly anything considered part of the 'Internet of Things'," said Prof Woodward.  Worryingly, it appears that the bug was first reported to the team that maintains glibc in July last year, but it was flagged as low priority.  The vulnerability is being compared to Shellshock, a bug discovered in 2014 which affected a huge range of computing devices.  The bug discovered in glibc has been present since 2008, experts said.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35587529	Students hit by University of Greenwich data breach	Personal details about hundreds of London-based research students were posted online in an apparent breach of data privacy laws.  The University of Greenwich has apologised and said it is in the process of contacting those affected.  The matter was brought to the BBC's attention by one of the students, who discovered the information could be found via a Google search.  They also flagged the matter to the UK's data watchdog.  The Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that an investigation is underway.  One legal expert warned there could be financial consequences.  "It does look as though there has been a significant breach of the Data Protection Act's obligations to process personal data securely, fairly and lawfully," said Ruth Boardman from the law firm Bird & Bird.  "[The university] may face enforcement action by the Information Commissioner (ICO) and claims by affected individuals.  "Under new rules due to be adopted in Brussels later in March, it would face a penalty of up to 10m euros [$11.2m; £7.8m]."  Students' names, addresses, dates of birth, mobile phone numbers and signatures were all uploaded to the university's website.  They were posted alongside minutes from the university's Faculty Research Degrees Committee, which oversees the registrations and progress of its research students.  In some cases, mental health and other medical problems were referenced to explain why students had fallen behind with their work.  In one example, it was disclosed that a student had a brother who was fighting in a Middle Eastern army and references were made to an asylum application.  Supervisors' comments about the students' progress were also documented.  In some instances, copies of emails between university staff and individual students were also published.  The university believes all the documents are now offline and has contacted Google to try to ensure cached copies of the documents cannot be retrieved from its search engine.  "I am very sorry that personal information about a number of postgraduate research students has been accessible on the university website," said Louise Nadal, the university's secretary.  "This was a serious error, in breach of our own policies and procedures. The material has now been removed. This was an unprecedented data breach for the university and we took action as quickly as possible, once the issue came to light.  "We are now acting urgently to identify those affected. I will be contacting each person individually to apologise and to offer the support of the university.  "At the same time, I am also conducting an investigation into what went wrong. This will form part of a robust review, to make sure that this cannot happen again. The findings and recommendations of the review will be published.  "We are co-operating fully with the Information Commissioner and we will take all steps necessary to ensure that we have the best systems in place for the future."  The university was unable to say whether or not any of its staff were aware of the problem before it was contacted by both the BBC and the ICO on Monday.  The watchdog confirmed that its investigation was at an early stage.  "We are aware of an incident at Greenwich University and are making enquiries," it said.  The student who discovered the uploads has not revealed their identity. They said they welcomed the fact the documents had been made inaccessible.  "It's sad that it took an investigation by the BBC to get the documents off the internet," they said.  "It's a huge relief. My motivation was that it is so wrong and I was worried about the Middle Eastern student who, to me, was put at great risk."  Ms Boardman said the affair served as a warning to other organisations who might not be properly reviewing the material they posted online.  "Public bodies do have obligations to publish information," the lawyer said.  "However, they must do so in a way which meets their obligations under data protection legislation.  "This breach shows the importance of doing this properly, so as to avoid causing significant distress to those whose information has been made available in this way."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35591594	Handheld ZX Spectrum Vega+ project announced on Indiegogo	The firm which recently re-launched classic games console the ZX Spectrum has announced a portable version of the device.  Sir Clive Sinclair, who created the original Spectrum, owns a stake in Retro Computers - the firm behind the refreshed versions of his console.  The Indiegogo project for the handheld Vega+ has already raised £44,780 ($31,000) of its £100,000 funding goal.  The Vega+ will come with 1,000 games if successfully funded.  On the Indiegogo product page for the project, Retro Computers explains that the device will feature an LCD screen but may also be connected to a TV.  The company adds that development of the product is complete and that a "fully working prototype" is ready to go into production - with units shipping as early as this summer.  "They obviously believe that there is room for retro gaming but at the same time people don't like necessarily sitting in front of TVs all the time to play games," said Stuart Miles, editor of gadget site Pocket-lint.  "By making it portable, it broadens it out to the same audience that would have played Gameboys years ago."  Mr Miles added, though, that "sometimes nostalgia for classic games was not always satisfied when they are played again.  Sometimes you're reminded how basic these games were," he told the BBC.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491835	TED 2016: The man making genes democratic	Keolu Fox is a man on a mission - he wants to overhaul the study of genes, which is increasingly revolutionising medicine, and find out why Polynesians and other indigenous groups are dying at faster rates than many other groups.  As a native Hawaiian, he has special interest in the second and as a medic is shocked by the fact that most of those who have so far contributed to the study of human genes are of European descent.  The Human Genome Project, which set out to identify and map all of the genes in a human body was completed in 2003 and since then there has been an explosion in the way medicine has used genetic sequencing to help treat and identify diseases.  "I started to study those things and I noticed some staggering trends. 96% of people who have their genes sequenced are of European ancestry," said Mr Fox.  "That means that the future of medicine, moving towards using genome sequencing as a tool for prediction, prevention and personalisation of disease and treatments is not going to include minority people. You begin to set the scene for social stratification, and the gap in health disparities will widen."  Mr Fox, who is a fifth year PhD student at University of Washington, is at TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) to talk about his new project IndiGenomics and he is particularly excited about a small box that he pulls out of his pocket on the stage.  The MinION, a palm-sized gene sequencer made by UK-based Oxford Nanopore Technologies, might not seem like the sort of shiny gadget that people would shout about.  But then most of the audience at the TED conference are not geneticists.  "I had a genome sequencer delivered to my house. Stop and think about how remarkable that is. No other time in history have we been able to democratise genomics in this way," Mr Fox tells the BBC.  He and his team aim to go out into the community with their mobile gene testers.  "We are de-blackboxing the technology - bringing it into the community, so that there is an understanding of how it works. Because of remote access to the internet, you can have a genome centre in your backpack.  "One of the first services of IndiGenomics will be a tribal consultation resource for indigenous groups. We will be educating indigenous communities about the potential use and misuse of genetic information with the hope that we begin to democratise genome sequencing so that indigenous people are partners not subjects of gene research," he said.  This work is crucial as indigenous populations often have unique health issues, some of which are down to cultural and societal influences but some of which may be genetic.  Polynesians, inlcuding Hawaiins, are more likely to suffer from Type 2 diabetes and obesity for example, while native Hawaiians die, on average, a decade earlier than their non-native counterparts.  "We want to understand the root cause of disease and your genome contributes to it" said Mr Fox.  There has been a long history of genetic research into indigenous communities but not all of it has gone down well.  "The reason that indigenous communities are wary of engaging Western research organisations is a history of mistrust," he said.  One of the most famous examples of this is a 1990s Arizona State University study of the North American Havasupai tribe.  "They took blood samples to alleviate Type 2 diabetes and then used those samples to assess schizophrenia, inbreeding and migration patterns which challenged their origin stories. The community were furious," said Mr Fox.  They successfully sued the university for $700,000 and banned the researchers from their land.  Vence L Bonham, a senior adviser at the US National Human Genome Research Institute agreed that "most genomic studies involve European ancestral populations" and that previous studies of indigenous populations have not always worked out well.  "One of the causes of the distrust are researchers, who conduct "helicopter research" where biological samples and health information are taken from the community, and there is no benefit to improving the health of the tribe or continued engagement with the tribe to provide information to the communities that participated in the research," he said.  He added that the organisation was "seeking to enhance the participation of ancestral diverse populations in genomics research including American Indian and Alaska Native communities if they desire".	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35589220	TED 2016: Google boss on why it is OK to fail	The head of Google's research and development lab X has been speaking about projects that failed, at the TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design) conference in Vancouver.  Astro Teller revealed the tech giant considered building air cargo ships and vast vertical farms but later rejected them.  The theme of this year's TED is Dream.  Mr Teller revealed that at X, dreams were big but failure was a key part of any project.  X, described as Google's "moon shot" factory, has many projects that have gone on to become reality, including Google's driverless car program and Project Loon, an attempt to use balloons to deliver internet to places that have been traditionally cut off from access.  Mr Teller revealed that the formula for deciding which projects to pursue was a simple one.  "We find a huge problem that affects millions of people, propose a radical solution and look for a breakthrough technology that can solve it.  "We spend most of our time breaking things and trying to prove we are wrong," he said.  Projects which were left on the cutting room floor included plans to build vertical farms.  Hydroponic farming, in which crops are grown indoors in boxes stacked on top of each other with no need for soil, is seen as a solution for an increasingly urban world population living in crowded cities with little space for land.  "One in nine people suffers from undernourishment and vertical farming uses 10 times less water, 100 times less land," said Mr Teller.  But the company rejected the idea of large-scale versions of such farms when it realised that staple crops such as rice and grain could not be grown in that way.  Others are ploughing ahead with vertical farming. Chicago-based FarmedHere plans to open a $23m (£16m) vertical farm in West Louisville while Japanese firm Fujitsu sells the produce it makes to hospitals, supermarkets and hotels.  The second project that Mr Teller revealed had been later ditched was a plan to build lighter-than-air cargo ships. That was dropped when the team working on it decided that it would cost too much to build a prototype.  "You can't spend $200 million on the first data point of a project," he said.  Failure is hugely important at X, Mr Teller told the TED audience.  "The only way to get people to work on big, risky things - audacious ideas - is to make it safe to fail," he said.  "The Silicon Valley hype machine has created this myth that visionaries are effortlessly creating the future. Don't believe the hype," he said.  Project Loon for instance, perhaps one of X's most outlandish ideas, has been a steep learning curve, Mr Teller said.  "We made round, silvery balloons, we made pillow balloons. We basically burst a lot of balloons," he said.  But, he added Project Loon now appears as a viable solution to the digital divide. He predicted that balloon-based net services along with other technologies would connect the rest of the world in the "next five to ten years".  "That will change the world in ways that we can't imagine," he said.	tech

The Times reported that Mr O'Carroll joined the party in Barrow-in-Furness after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.  The constituency MP, John Woodcock, and deputy leader Tom Watson were among those to say he was not welcome.  A Labour spokesman said: "Tom O'Carroll has been suspended from the Labour Party."  Mr Woodcock had tweeted on Tuesday that he was "dismayed" Mr O'Carroll had joined the party, and said he had written to Labour's general secretary, Iian McNicol to ask for him to be banned for life.  Meanwhile, Mr Watson, Labour's deputy leader, said in a tweet: "Just picking up on the Tom O'Carroll story. Have to verify the facts but he is not welcome in the Labour Party and nor are his views."  Formed in 1974, the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE) campaigned for "children's sexuality". It wanted the government to scrap or lower the age of consent.  In 1981, Mr O'Carroll, then PIE's chairman, was sentenced to two years in jail for "conspiracy to corrupt public morals". PIE was disbanded in 1984.  O'Carroll was sentenced to two and a half years in prison in 2006 for distributing child pornography images.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35586446	Android Mazar malware that can 'wipe phones' spread via SMS	A Danish security company has detected an attempt to spread a powerful form of Android malware via text messages.  Mazar can gain administrator rights on phones, allowing it to wipe handsets, make calls or read texts.  However, it will not install on phones where the language is set to Russian.  Additionally, users would have to have unchecked a default setting on Android devices that ensures software may only be installed from trusted sources.  Security firm Heimdal thinks the malicious texts could have been sent to over 100,000 phones in Denmark, though it is not sure whether users in other countries may have received the messages.  This is believed to be the first time Mazar has been detected in widespread, real world attacks.  In the examples studied by Heimdal, users receive an innocuous-looking text providing a link to what looks like a multimedia message.  This link downloads Tor software, which enables anonymous internet connections, to the phone.  Afterwards, the malware itself is downloaded through Tor in an apparent effort to hide the source of the malicious software itself.  One interesting feature of Mazar is that it cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with "Russian" selected as the operating system's language.  Similar controls have been detected in PC malware in the past, according to Morten Kjaersgaard, chief executive of Heimdal.  Infected phones are at risk from a range of threats - from attackers secretly monitoring devices to reading a user's texts or even erasing all personal data from the handset.  Or, the attacker could simply send a lot of texts to premium numbers.  "It can do a lot of damage - maybe running up a big phone bill for which the customer would be liable," Mr Kjaersgaard told the BBC.  "It's not like when you use your credit card and there's an international standard for banks covering [fraud]."  Heimdal tested phones running Android Kitkat (version 4.4) but Mr Kjaersgaard believes the issue is likely to affect all prior versions as well.  Later versions of the operating system have not been tested.  The advice to users is to never tap on web links in text messages from unfamiliar phone numbers and to be cautious of links even if the message appears to be from a known contact since sometimes this can be spoofed.  "Over one billion devices are protected with Google Play which conducts 200 million security scans of devices per day," a Google spokeswoman said.  "Fewer than 1% of Android devices had a Potentially Harmful App installed in 2014, and fewer than 0.15% of devices that only install from Google Play had a Potentially Harmful App installed," she added.	tech

The artist released The Life of Pablo on Jay-Z's music streaming service Tidal two days ago.  Thousands of subscribers have complained that they have been unable to download the album, despite paying for it.  It is currently one of the most popular music downloads on The Pirate Bay.  The new material appears twice in the controversial file-sharing site's top 10 music downloads, despite Kanye West himself tweeting that it would only be available on Tidal.  The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has also filed nearly 20 takedown requests to Google for websites illegally hosting the material, Torrent Freak reports.  However RIAA chief executive Cary Sherman wrote last year that the approach is increasingly ineffective.  "While the system worked when isolated incidents of infringement occurred on largely static web pages - as was the case when the [US copyright] law was passed in 1998 - it is largely useless in the current world where illegal links that are taken down reappear instantaneously," he said.  "The result is a never-ending game that is both costly and increasingly pointless."  The level of piracy of The Life of Pablo is unusual, Ernesto from Torrent Freak told the BBC.  "Generally we don't track music releases closely, so I'm not calling any records," he said.  "However, I haven't seen numbers this high before for a music release - not with Adele either."	tech

According to Callisto creator Jessica Ladd, sexual assault is "practically a rite of passage" in US universities.  Its website has already been trialled for a few months at the University of San Francisco and Pomona College.  Other universities are now being invited to take part.  The US Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network said it could help victims.  As a survivor of college sexual assault herself, Ms Ladd said she wanted to use technology to empower victims and do more to keep campuses safe.  "I went through the reporting process and found it needlessly re-traumatising and intimidating and it felt like a missed opportunity for justice," she told the BBC at the Vancouver event.  "Reporting a sexual assault should be a way to reclaim control over your life. Instead for many survivors it feels like you are losing control all over again."  She said that one in five women and one in 13 men experience some form of sexual assault during their time at college.  The statistics are borne out by a 2015 study from the Association of American Universities, although it noted that there was "wide variation" in the rates reported at the 27 universities surveyed.  More than 150,000 students were questioned. 23% of the women said that they had experienced some form of unwanted sexual contact carried out by force or the threat of force, ranging from fondling to rape.  About 50% of the women who stated that they were victims of sexual assault, said they had not reported it at the time.  Only 10% of victims report a sexual assault and the better they know their assailant, the less likely they are to report them, said Ms Ladd.  "Our system is designed to break down the barriers to reporting," she added.  "We provide clear information about the process if you report your assault. We provide a way to create an online, time-stamped record of what happened to you."  The latter is important because, she says, victims on average wait 11 months before they report an incident.  It also allows victims to enter a matching system which only reports the crime if the same perpetrator has previously been reported - although at no point do the users see details of other victims.  For a generation growing up used to finding out information via the web, it makes sense to create an online system, Ms Ladd told the BBC.  "Why not have first place for [reporting] sexual assault be the internet?" she asked.  "It is a huge step to talk to police or your school. People are worried they might not believe you and they are worried about what they will do with your information."  Scott Berkowitz, founder of the US Rape, Abuse and Incest National Network, thinks it could be an important tool.  "My initial reaction is that I'm excited by the idea of it and can see how it can potentially change the way victims react to these crimes and encourage reporting of them," he told the BBC, although he added that it is still at a very early stage.  "Being able to see that your actions could help others and that you don't have to go it alone is important."  Callisto is not the only online service designed to help sexual assault victims.  Circle of Six allows users to choose six trusted friends who can be automatically alerted in the event of an emergency at the press of a button.  It won the White House's Apps Against Abuse challenge in 2011 and has since gained thousands of users around the world.  More recently, an app dubbed I've Been Violated has invited victims to record their stories.  They are encrypted and geo-stamped so they can act as "contemporaneous evidence" of the assaults. However, one critic has suggested that preventing victims from being able to alter their reports sends out the wrong message about how trustworthy they are.  Callisto relies on a website rather than working as a standalone program because its creators say some students expressed concern at the idea of others spotting they had a sexual assault app on their phone.  Other solutions include nail varnish that detects date-rape drugs in drinks and necklaces with built-in panic buttons.  Mr Berkowitz acknowledged, however, that "technology alone can't solve the problem".  "Universities have historically downplayed the problem, claiming it doesn't happen on their campuses but research tells us it is a problem on every campus," he said.  "Prevention education needs to be a part of normal college experience."  He added that, while the statistics were high for colleges, the problem was not confined to universities.  "It seems to have less to do with college and more to do with the age group. The risk for women aged 18-24 who are not in college is actually slightly higher."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35581860	Government launches porn site age checks consultation	A public consultation over plans to implement age checks on pornography websites has been launched by the UK government.  The proposals follow a Conservative Party manifesto commitment that "all sites containing pornographic material" must check that users are over 18.  Internet providers, charities, academics and others will be asked to contribute to the consultation.  A security expert said the plans would struggle to tackle porn on free sites.  In the consultation document, the government proposes that the checks should apply to content that would receive - if formally classified - an 18 or R18 rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).  "We are keen to hear from parents, schools, child protection experts, the pornography industry, internet service providers and online platforms that provide access to pornographic content," the consultation document explained.  As part of the plans, the government intends to establish a new regulatory framework to enforce compliance with any rules that are made law.  "Just as we do offline, we want to make sure children are prevented from accessing pornographic content online which should only be viewed by adults," said Baroness Shields, the Internet Safety and Security Minister.  Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC said the issue was "a matter of urgency" and that children who had ready access to content rated over 18 could develop a "warped" view of sexual relationships.  Prior to the general election, then Culture Secretary Sajid Javid said that the appointed regulator would have the power to force internet service providers to block sites that did not perform effective age checks.  He also said providers who did not cooperate could be fined.  The consultation document explains that the regulator of age checks on porn sites could be given powers to impose "sanctions" - including fines.  Companies which support or provide services to the producers of pornographic content online could be "directed" to withdraw those services if sites were found to be persistently non-compliant.  This could involve directing payment firms to cease processing transactions for porn producers.  Ofcom's guidance on age checks for online video content suggest a range of options - from confirmation of credit card ownership to cross-checking a user's details with information on the electoral register.  "Age checking is nothing new," said Ben Jordan from Aristotle, which provides such services.  "The online gambling industry has been doing this for years and it's been very effective."  Dr Victoria Nash, at the Oxford Internet Institute, was the lead author of a report for the government on child use of online pornography.  She said that gambling sites may well also check registered users' credentials against data in the electoral roll or driving licence databases.  Dr Nash added that it was likely porn site age checks would use similar methods to ensure users are 18 or over.  However, a leading security researcher has said this would not stamp out much of the pornography that is freely available online.  "My initial response to this release is that while the UK government may get some traction with payment processors, and that that could have some effect, it won't affect the free pornography," said Dr Gilad Rosner, who is a member of the Cabinet Office Privacy and Consumer Advocacy Group.  Dr Rosner added that much pornographic content was available on free sites and blogs which do not take any payments from users.  "I would wager that we won't see much in the way of tangible results for the next five years," he said, "This is a particularly challenging regulatory goal."  Even so, one of the most visited free sites for pornography has already signalled its intention to co-operate.  "Pornhub will comply fully with any robust legislative and relevant local measures that emerge from this consultation," said a spokeswoman for the site.  "As members of the Digital Policy Alliance, we have already been working to carve out a technical solution which works for all.  "It's essential that all explicit adult content is covered, and non-compliant sites are quickly taken down."	tech

So, it's no small achievement that Star Citizen's creator says he has raised more than $108m (£75m) to develop the title via online crowdfunding campaigns.  In fact, it makes the sci-fi space simulator the biggest crowdfunded project of all time.  Not bad considering its creator, Chris Roberts, had originally hoped to raise about a tenth of the amount.  That would have funded a much smaller game than Star Citizen has evolved into, Roberts told the BBC.  "I never thought we would raise the money we have, I was going to start more contained and over time its sort of filled out," he said.  But with the title running years behind its originally announced schedule, he has still to prove he can meet the backers' expectations.  Roberts is famous among video game fans for the popular 1990's spaceship combat Wing Commander series.  The popularity of these games built Roberts a huge fan base, which dug into its own pockets to fund his new PC game.  Roberts' development company is called Cloud Imperium. It operates four studios spread across three different countries (the US, UK and Germany), all working to realise Star Citizen's grand vision.  It's what's known as a massively multiplayer online (MMO) game, which allows the player to pilot space ships, big and small, and even become part of the crew on huge vessels.  The universe is planned to be a huge explorable sandbox. Players should be able to engage in first-person combat, spaceship racing, visiting and exploring space stations and planets.  It is a persistent universe of huge ambition - so ambitious it's taking much longer to develop than originally anticipated.  The game was first announced back in 2012, with a release planned for 2014.  But at present only small taster portions of the game are available to play.  Inevitably some backers and internet observers have taken to forums and blogs to vent their anger at the delays.  "If you are building a two-bedroom house and suddenly change to building a castle it's going to be a different timeline."  But he also thinks this game is far from unique when it comes to delays.  "In the games business, games get cancelled all the time, games get pushed back and by the time you hear about the game it's probably been in development for years.  "Things always took longer than anyone thought."  He concedes that "there are always going to be some people that say, you told me it was going to be two years, I want it to be this big , I want it in two years."  "That isn't necessarily possible," he adds.  "Most of our customers aren't like that. They say: 'Take the time you need. If you need 10 years for a really great space game don't rush it out and make a bad one.'"  With the development studios spread out across the US and Europe, Roberts is often travelling between them all, checking the progress of the individual teams.  BBC Click visited the Los Angeles studio in California and the Wilmslow studio in the UK.  The atmosphere inside the studios was almost identical: dozens of artists and designers working on spaceship designs and character animations as well as painstakingly sifting though lines of code in search of bugs.  There was a sense of calm, but the size and complexity of the project is mind boggling to the outside observer.  There are almost 300 people working on this game and they are taking advantage of their different time zones.  The studio head in Los Angeles said that when a bug is found by his team, they can work on the problem and then, at the end of their day, hand it over to workers in the UK to crack, and vice-versa with bugs found at any of the other studios.  They call this "follow the sun" development. It means that work on Star Citizen is pretty much a 24-hour operation.  As well as the persistent universe there will also be a single player story-driven game called Squadron 42.  It sounds very much like Roberts is working in familiar Wing Commander territory here. In Squadron 42 the player assumes the role of a rookie pilot, embroiled in a war with a vicious alien species.  While the set-up is a little on the familiar side Roberts has assembled a star-studded cast for the game including Gary Oldman, Mark Strong and Gillian Anderson.  While the larger universe is still in development, Roberts says he aims to release Squadron 42 by the end of this year.  So, it looks like we are going to have to wait a little bit longer to play the full Star Citizen experience.	tech

Computer systems at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center have been offline for more than a week following a ransomware attack.  According to local news sources, hackers were said to have demanded $3.4m (£2.4m) to provide the codes to unlock the stolen data.  The hospital has confirmed the attack took place, but has not commented on the ransom.  A voicemail message at the hospital reassures patients that medical records had not been accessed by the hackers.  Investigations into the source of the attack - which hospital officials said appeared to be random rather than targeted at the facility - are being conducted by the FBI, Los Angeles Police and computer forensics experts hired by the hospital.  The hospital insists that day-to-day operations have not been impacted, although many tasks normally carried out on computer are now being done on paper, much to the frustration of staff.  Patients are also being told they must travel to pick up medical test results in person rather than receive them electronically.  Ransomware attacks are increasingly common, and are difficult to fully protect against.  Malicious software is placed on a computer - often via phishing attacks - and proceed to lock up files.  Ransomware will typically try to extort money from the user quickly, saying that if the demand is not met, the files will be deleted.  The most common type of ransomware is a malware package known as Cryptolocker, which experts say has infected hundreds of thousands of machines around the world.  Last month, the council for the English county of Lincolnshire was hit with a £1m ransomware demand - but it said it refused to pay.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC or on Facebook	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35579225	BT ad gets into a muddle about the internet's origins	An advert published by the UK's leading broadband provider indicates confusion within the firm about the internet's origins.  BT's Openreach division referred to the UK as the "country that invented the internet" in the ad, which was printed over the weekend.  However, the US is widely credited as being the net's creator thanks to a Department of Defense project that dates back to the 1960s.  "For most people, the words 'internet' and 'world wide web' are interchangeable," said a spokesman for the firm.  "We accept the language wasn't precise enough for some, but no harm has been done."  The internet refers to the millions of interlinked computer networks used to transmit data. It encompasses information sent via email, chat tools, apps and a range of other online services in addition to websites.  By contrast, the world wide web is a subsection of the internet made up of webpages, documents and other resources connected together via hyperlinks.  The internet was born out of Arpanet, a US government-backed scheme that initially only connected the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), 400 miles (644km) away.  It was not until 1973 that a university in the UK and a Norwegian research institute were added as the first international participants in the project.  Although University College London subsequently helped test the networking protocols that gave rise to what we now recognise as the internet, much of the original work on them had been carried out at Stanford.  "While Donald Davies and his team at the National Physical Laboratory can lay claim to having developed packet-switching that enabled the technological infrastructure of the internet, Vint Cerf and a number of Americans were the driving forces behind the Arpanet that became the internet," commented Prof Martin Campbell-Kelly, a trustee at The National Museum of Computing.  It is not clear, however, that the UK can even lay claim to having invented the web.  The English computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee was indeed its creator, but he was working at Cern - the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland - at the time.  Even so, one computing historian suggested BT's mistake was an easy one to have made.  "People mistakenly conflate the internet and the world wide web all the time," said Tom Lean.  "But while Britain may not have invented the internet, not only was the web co-invented by a Brit, BT themselves rolled out the world's first service that was a lot like the world wide web, Prestel, back in the 1980s.  "Sadly BT closed Prestel in the early 1990s, because they couldn't interest enough people in using it."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577506	New 'sexting' guidance 'to avoid criminalising children'	Police in England and Wales are producing new guidelines designed to avoid "criminalising" children caught sending indecent images to each other.  Under current Home Office rules any such "sexting" incident reported to the police must be recorded as a crime.  The National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) will advise teachers on when they should report such incidents.  It confirmed to the BBC that new guidelines were being developed but were in very early stages.  Sending indecent selfies to a friend or lover using a smartphone is known as sexting.  Typically in England and Wales, producing and distributing sexual images of anybody under 18 is a criminal offence, even if two under-18s are sexting one another.  If an incident of teen sexting is reported to police, the names of those allegedly involved can be stored on the Police National Database for at least 10 years, even if no criminal charges are brought.  In 2015, a Freedom of Information request by the Sun revealed that 1,000 under-18s had been investigated by police for sexting between 2012 and 2014.  The new guidance, which will be sent to schools and police forces in England and Wales, will advise teachers on when they should report sexting to the police.  "These incidences do not need to be reported in every situation," said Deputy Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, of the NPCC.  "Parents and professionals can use their own judgement on when to involve the police."  The Sunday Times newspaper suggested that the guidance might advise that incidents involving children being blackmailed or bullied over their naked pictures were the sort of more "serious cases" where teachers might decide to involve the police.  Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the news.  Alan Wardle, its head of policy, said: "Clearly it is an issue. It is how young people are living their lives and expressing their sexuality... we have to deal with the reality of that."  "What we don't want to be doing is necessarily criminalising 15-year-olds sending pictures of themselves in a consensual relationship... it is an issue that needs to be looked at.  "If they're going to university, they're going for jobs... they don't want something that happened when they were younger haunting them for years to come."  The police chiefs' council said it would work with schools and families to help prevent young people becoming "the victims and perpetrators of crime".  "Sexting may seem like a harmless or normal activity but there are many risks involved," said DCC Pinkney.  "It is essential that we work, alone and alongside partners such as schools and families, to intervene early."	tech

The problem affects voice-over-internet-protocol (Voip) phones, commonly used by businesses.  Snom, the manufacturer whose phones were used in the research, has said the attack affects outdated software.  A spokesman said the tested firmware was "never in wide circulation".  The researcher carried out tests on a phone that was reset to "default" factory settings.  Just by running a couple of lines of code on a website visited by the phone user, the researchers demonstrated how premium-rate calls could be made.  By exploiting the fact that Voip phones and desktop computers are connected to the same internet network at many organisations, attackers are often able to access the phones themselves and operate them without the owner becoming aware.  "It's incredibly easy to do," said security researcher Per Thorsheim, who was involved in the demonstration by fellow researcher Paul Moore.  However, a spokesman for Snom said, "Snom's internal investigation reveals that the desktop telephone used in Mr. Paul Moore's experiment was an old 2008 telephone model utilizing outdated beta firmware... which was never in wide circulation.  "The latest and current firmware is version 8.7.5.35 and there have been multiple firmware releases since the outdated beta release."  The spokesman added that Snom telephones by default request that both users and network administrators set a password during installation.  "If a password is not set, a continuous non-stop, endless visual warning on the device's display is illuminated," he said.  Mr Thorsheim explained that the tested phone could be compromised if the user visited a web page containing a couple of lines of Javascript web code.  Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey, said attacks on Voip phones were a "significant problem" and pointed out that by using online tools he was able to find many examples of phones that could be accessed using the method.  "The one we do know where it's being used a lot is premium-rate scams," he told the BBC.  "They use your phone to dial a premium-rate number. There's a lot of that going on - we're talking millions being made out of that."  The practice of using phone lines paid for by companies to make expensive calls for little or no fee is thought to be increasingly common, according to research by security consultancy Nettitude.  In a report last year, it said that the UK was particularly badly affected.  Prof Woodward said the issue was similar to other flaws found in internet-connected devices and warned that with the rise of the Internet of Things, similar tricks were likely to become more and more common.  "It's a huge wake-up call to anybody who's building devices with embedded software," he said.	tech

Open data published by Nasa was used to make the map, which has been posted on the OS Flickr account.  This is the first time in history that OS has produced a map of territory from another planet.  It has also been printed in a one-off edition for a British scientist helping to plan the landing of a rover on Mars in 2019.  "It was a little hard at first to actually understand the data itself in terms of things like the elevation and the scale and so on," said the OS cartographer behind the map, Chris Wesson.  "But actually the physical process was almost identical to what was used to make an Earth map, or any OS map."  The map itself covers roughly 10 million sq km (3.8 million sq miles) - or about 7% of the total Martian surface.  Mr Wesson said he could imagine a future astronaut using a copy of the map - perhaps in digital form - when exploring Mars.  "You have these large areas that looked flat but they're actually really rocky and uneven surfaces - that was the most difficult bit of the map, to try to show that but put it in proportion to these huge craters," he told the BBC.  OS was asked to make the map by Dr Peter Grindrod, a British scientist at Birkbeck, University of London.  Dr Grindrod is helping to plan the landing of the European ExoMars rover in early 2019.  "He's given extremely good responses so far," said Mr Wesson.  Dr Grindrod said he had always admired OS maps and pointed out that they are good at including lots of information in an easily read format.  "It's wonderful to see the same style applied to Mars, and especially such a fascinating region," he said.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35580758	Councils warned of penalties over political boycotts	Councils are being warned of "severe penalties" if they impose political boycotts on products from overseas.  New government guidance suggests boycotts could breach an existing World Trade Organization agreement and weaken community relationships.  Cabinet Office Minister Matt Hancock will make a speech later, warning that such "divisive" action can also undermine national security.  Labour said the Conservatives were attacking local democracy.  But a government source said foreign policy was a matter for national government, not local councils.  The guidance will specify that locally imposed boycotts by public bodies - including councils - are "inappropriate" unless formal legal sanctions or embargoes have been put in place by the government.  It will warn such action risks breaching a World Trade Organization agreement signed by both the EU and Israel, which requires equal treatment for suppliers from all signatory nations.  The Cabinet Office said town hall boycotts could also "undermine good community relations, poisoning and polarising debate, weakening integration and fuelling anti-Semitism", as well as hindering Britain's export trade and harming international relationships.  Mr Hancock is making the announcement in Israel, which has often been the subject of boycotts in the past.  He is expected to say the guidelines, and new rules on investing pensions funds, will "help prevent damaging and counter-productive local foreign policies undermining our national security".  A spokesman for Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the ban would have outlawed council action against apartheid South Africa.  He said: "People have the right to elect local representatives able to make decisions free of central government political control. That includes withdrawal of investments or procurement on ethical and human rights grounds."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35577458	Centuries-old vellum tradition 'to be saved'	A centuries-old tradition of recording copies of Parliament's laws on calf skin will continue, a minister has said, after peers signalled its end.  Matt Hancock said the technique was "cost-effective" and the Cabinet Office would look at how to pick up the bill.  The Lords had said switching from a parchment called vellum to archival paper could save about £80,000 a year.  It said it had not received an offer from the government department and so would proceed with the original plans.  "If the Cabinet Office write offering to take on the responsibility for printing Acts of Parliament on vellum, it would of course be considered.  "As of yet, that offer has not been made," a spokesman said.  Two copies are made of Acts of Parliament. One is stored in the National Archives and the other in the Parliamentary Archives.  Significant state documents - such as Magna Carta and thousands of Acts of Parliament - have traditionally been recorded on goat or calf skin.  MPs had handed the decision to end the practice to the House of Lords, which is responsible for the cost of vellums for Parliament, and peers decided to push ahead with the cost-cutting measure.  The House of Lords said vellum was "extremely expensive" and the cost of printing copies of laws on it - which it put at £100,000 a year "cannot be justified".  "Archival quality paper is an extremely high quality and durable alternative," said chairman of committees Lord Laming.  The Commons Administration Committee backed the Lords' proposal, saying it was "convinced by the arguments".  However, it encountered criticism from MPs, with Conservative James Gray calling for the "retrograde decision" to be reversed.  Mr Hancock told the Daily Telegraph: "Recording laws on vellum is a millennium-long traditions and surprisingly cost-effective.  "While the world constantly changes, we should safeguard some of our great traditions."  In 1999, the House of Lords decided in favour of scrapping the use of vellum - but the move was rejected in the Commons by 121 votes to 53, a majority of 68.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35577498	Fury after Adobe Creative Cloud deletes files	Adobe has patched its Creative Cloud apps after people noticed the software was deleting Mac users' files without warning.  After customers updated Creative Cloud, it accessed their hard drive and deleted the first folder that appeared in alphabetical order.  Due to file-naming conventions on Mac computers, the bug often deleted hidden system folders or data backup files.  Adobe issued a fix for the issue on Sunday.  Many people in the creative industries have reacted angrily on social media.  "So Creative Cloud is what screwed up my Backblaze backups. Thanks, Adobe," said college instructor JJ Litke.  "I think Adobe owes us an explanation, and owes Backblaze a public apology. This bug is disturbing and terrifying," tweeted Funjon.  "Great news that fix is out but very disappointed Adobe haven't been very transparent or apologetic about the issue," said another user.  The problem came to light on Thursday after Backblaze, which makes data backup software, started receiving hundreds of support requests from its customers.  The firm's software detected that some of the files it uses to perform its duties had been deleted, and staff discovered that Creative Cloud was responsible after a designer installed Adobe's update.  The issue was present in Creative Cloud version 3.5.0.206 on a Mac.  "We kept testing and realised that this was occurring upon 'sign-in' to Creative Cloud," Backblaze said on its blog.  The company later identified the Creative Cloud bug was deleting the first folder that appeared on the hard drive in alphabetical order.  On a Mac, hidden files and folders are prefixed with "." which the operating system places before A in alphabetical order.  The flaw interfered with Backblaze's software by chance because the backup software places a hidden folder called ".bzvol" on the hard drives it indexes, which happened to be top of the list.  On machines without the backup software installed, a different folder may have been deleted instead.  "As someone affected by this bug I am pretty annoyed. Materially it hasn't (yet) cost me any work, but it's a huge violation of trust," said one user on Reddit.  In a statement, Adobe said: "On the 12 Feb we were notified that some customers had an issue with an update to the Creative Cloud Desktop application.  "We removed the update from distribution and deployed a new one which addresses the issue."	tech

The site briefly hosted a digital copy of Het Achterhuis, the first version of the diary compiled by Anne's father Otto, which was published in 1947.  It had been put online in the belief that the copyright expired in January 2016, 70 years after Anne's death.  However, under US law it is protected until 2047.  The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia as well as Wikisource, said its action was "an unfortunate example of the overreach of the US' current copyright law".  "In general, the US copyright for works published before 1978 is 95 years from date of publication," it said.  "Foreign works of countries that are treaty partners to the United States are covered as if they were US works."  The removal of the book has highlighted confusion over the copyright status of Anne Frank's famous diary, because so many different editions exist and legislation varies around the world.  Under European law, books typically leave copyright 70 years after the author's death and can then be reproduced freely.  Anne Frank died in 1945, which suggests that her elements of the original Dutch language version of the diary are now copyright free.  "The elements of the original, un-edited version written by Anne Frank - which were first published in 1947 - are now in the public domain in the UK, given she died in 1945 and the copyright duration in the UK for the version published then will be no longer than 70 years after her death," commented Adam Rendle from the law firm Taylor Wessing.  However, this is disputed by Anne Frank Fonds, a charitable foundation founded by Otto Frank.  It says that because Anne's father compiled and edited the initial version of the book sold to the public, he earned his own copyright, even though it acknowledges that he should not be considered its "co-author".  Since Otto Frank died in 1980, it says that means the copyright of the 1947 edition would not expire in many countries until 2050.  Furthermore, the foundation notes that Anne Frank's full, unedited manuscripts were not published until 1986, so it argues these are protected by copyright for even longer .  "Copyright duration can be tricky to determine because the rules can be different in different countries, it can depend on facts that are very difficult to determine and the law as applied to those facts can be complex," said Mr Rendle.  "It gets even trickier when different versions have been published and different authors have had different levels of input into those versions, as seems to have happened here."  Mr Rendle also pointed out that translations of the book will be under the copyright of the people who translated them.  "Publication on the internet can become a minefield when different countries have different copyright durations," he pointed out.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11483334	Obituary: Lord Avebury	Eric Lubbock, later Lord Avebury, caused one of the most sensational by-election victories in British political history when he took Orpington for the Liberals in 1962.  The poll was hailed as the beginning of a Liberal revival, and the end of the two party domination of British politics.  In the event it turned out to be no more than a freak result and Liberal hopes were, as would happen so often in the future, doomed to disappointment.  After losing his seat Lubbock continued his political career in the Lords becoming a doughty campaigner for human rights.  Eric Reginald Lubbock was born on 29 September 1928 in the Kentish village of Dene, part of the Orpington constituency, a grandson of the first Baron Avebury,  He was educated at Harrow and at Balliol College, Oxford, where he took an engineering degree and won a Blue for boxing.  Lubbock did his National Service in the Welsh Guards, first as a Guardsman and later as a junior officer before joining Rolls Royce where he worked as an engineer.  He became a Liberal councillor in 1960 and was selected to fight the by-election in what was seen as the safe Conservative seat of Orpington following the appointment of the sitting Conservative MP, Donald Sumner, as a High Court judge.  Lubbock had a mountain to climb. The Conservatives were sitting on a majority of nearly 15,000 and, in the 1959 general election, the Liberals had trailed in third.  But he fought a tenacious campaign highlighting the perceived shortcomings of Harold Macmillan's government. "We must not stop in our efforts to overthrow Tory blunder," he told his enthusiastic supporters.  Cracks began to appear in the Conservative campaign when their candidate Peter Goldman, who came from outside the seat, announced he had no intention of moving to live there if he became the MP.  At the same time the government announced a public-sector pay freeze that badly hit commuter areas like Orpington and impacted most severely on nurses, a move that was deemed highly unpopular.  Despite this, few political analysts predicted anything other than a Conservative win and there was general astonishment when Lubbock overturned the 1959 result - leaving the Conservatives with a deficit of nearly 7,000.  The result helped hasten the end of the Macmillan government and raised hopes within the Liberal Party that were never in fact realised.  During the next eight years, Lubbock earned a reputation in the House of Commons, not only for a conscientious devotion to the interests of his suburban constituents, but also by his tenacity in cases involving civil liberties and his grasp of technological affairs.  For good measure, he also served during most of this period as Liberal Chief Whip.  Lubbock held Orpington against fierce Conservative opposition at both the 1964 and 1966 general elections, but was defeated by the Conservative candidate in 1970.  "In 1962 the wise, far-seeing people of Orpington elected me as their Member," he said. "In 1970 the fools threw me out."  A year later he succeeded to the Avebury peerage on the death of his cousin, the third Baron; it seemed likely at first that he would renounce the title so as to contest Orpington again, but after consultation with the Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe he decided to accept his inheritance.  Before taking his seat in the House of Lords he visited Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, on behalf of Amnesty International to report on political detentions in the island. The government of Ceylon did not encourage his inquiries and eventually expelled him.  In the Lords he continued to fight for civil liberties, often taking up immigrant cases and speaking out against racism. And, as chairman of the Parliamentary Human Rights Committee, he campaigned for better treatment for prisoners in the UK and abroad.  He became part of the Liberal Democrats Foreign Affairs team in the Lords, cycling to sittings from his home in Camberwell.  Avebury was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Humanist Association and, in 2009, won a National Secular Society award for his part in the abolition of the law on Blasphemous Libel.  He also caused controversy in 2011 when he came out strongly in support of traveller families facing eviction from the Dale Farm site in Essex  In his later years he was diagnosed with a form of blood cancer and became an advocate for assisted dying.  "It is unthinkable that we should not take measures to enable people to alleviate their own suffering," he said.  A convert to Buddhism, he was passionate about recycling and once declared that he intended to leave his body to Battersea Dogs' Home. The offer was gracefully declined.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35493443	The dating apps taking on Tinder	Valentine's Day is not just a big day for couples - millions of singles are expected to fire up dating apps today in search of romance.  Tinder leads the market in the UK, boasting 26 million "matches" per day globally. The company says it broke its own records last Valentine's Day as people flocked to the app looking for love.  Behind the app is dating giant Match, which also owns other big names including match.com, OKCupid and Plenty of Fish - but there are plenty of start-ups hoping to charm singles and top the app store charts.  "Whatever competitors do, they will need to be cash rich and able to support the business to stand a chance of success," says Paolo Pescatore, director of Multiplay and Media at CCS Insight.  "But there is scope for new players to emerge that focus on a specific niche."  Combining match-making with games and quizzes, DatePlay is designed to generate "more meaningful matches" than its rivals.  Behind the app is entrepreneur Vana Koutsomitis, who first pitched her idea on the BBC television series The Apprentice.  She did not win Lord Sugar's investment - he judged the project too risky - but she has continued work on her app, which she hopes will make online dating more fun.  "If you sign up for any of the online dating sites that focus on meaningful relationships, you'll be asked to fill out tonnes of questions about yourself," she says.  "What we're doing is making an interface that is a game instead of these self reports."  Singles hoping to challenge strangers to a round of battleships or gin rummy will have to look elsewhere, for now. The app will be launched with its first game this summer, with more added later.  "Our first game is a Buzzfeed-style quiz where you will be answering questions about your preferences in terms of photos. You'll work through it in a fun and interactive way."  One concern raised on The Apprentice was that people might spend all day playing a game, only to be matched with somebody they did not find attractive. But Koutsomitis says playing for longer improves your chances of finding the perfect date.  "As you continue to play the game we continue to get more data about you... that allows us to match you with better people," she explains.  "We think it's more important to have a few meaningful matches."  In a bid to cut out "creeps and timewasters", Hanky lets existing members decide whether new joiners should be allowed in.  The app, for men only, launched in January. At the time, founder Jonas Cronfield boasted: "Our users are nicer and more sexy."  But critics say Hanky fosters superficiality and superiority, by providing an environment where people are judged on their appearance.  And while it is not the first dating service that lets people judge others on their looks, critics say the app divides a community that has fought discrimination.  The company insists it has good intentions.  "The vetting system is there just because we are trying to narrow it down a little bit, it's trying to help people not waste so much time on these apps," says Johan Andersson, the firm's chief evangelist.  "The process of joining is harder than normal. You can't just go on there, upload a photo and start chatting to people. By the time you're approved, if you're still just looking to waste people's time, you've gone through a lot of trouble to do that."  The app has attracted 85,000 members since its launch - although many more have tried to join. Andersson says eight out of 10 applicants are rejected by existing members.  A system that can validate members' identities has an obvious appeal to a community of men that has been targeted by criminals through rival apps.  But critics say Hanky's self-regulating process falls short, letting members judge whether new joiners are "creeps" or "timewasters" just by looking at their photographs.  "The point was never to stop crime," says Andersson. "We can take no responsibility for what happens between two people when they communicate online."  While other apps focus on providing you with a wide choice of singles, Once strives to provide quality over quantity.  The app allows you just one match a day, hand-picked by a human curator and delivered to your phone at noon.  Daters have 24 hours to initiate a conversation and move things forward, before their "match" disappears and is replaced with a new one to consider over lunch.  "You have 24 hours of full, undivided attention," says the app's creator Jean Meyer. "There's nobody else, no noise. It's a special moment for 24 hours."  A special moment, or perhaps 24 hours of awkward silence.  While rival apps such as Tinder give you plenty of people to scroll through, with Once there is no skipping ahead, and your first "match" is chosen by a stranger.  "Anybody can pick someone who is very good-looking and smart, that's easy. But you need this person also to like you," explains Meyer.  "When we have a matchmaker forcing you into a match, you have a lot of chances that the person you're being matched with is also going to like you."  Rejection is easy to accept on Tinder, where a new match is only a swipe away. Does Once risk upsetting people who could go a week without anybody saying hello?  "It's a dating app, not a self-esteem app. It's not about boosting your ego, you have Instagram for that," says Meyer.  One in three matches turns into a conversation, he reassures me. And those unhappy with today's match can take control and choose somebody they would like to speak to from a list of 10.  But they won't be offered up for conversation until at least noon the following day - and with a maximum of seven introductions a week, finding "the one" could be a lengthy process.  "If you pass, your next match is going to come the next day, so you can do something else," says Meyer.  "Go take a hike, or walk, or go to the movie theatre with your friends... don't spend three hours swiping, because technology should help you gain time not waste it.  "When you're done with your match of the day, do something else - please! Live your life."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35562697	Police consider Newark by-election spending claims	Nottinghamshire Police is considering evidence relating to accusations of overspending by the Conservative Party during the 2014 Newark by-election.  The move follows claims by Channel 4 News that some bills were not included in local spending returns during the poll and two other by-elections.  Labour's defeated candidate in the Newark poll, which the Conservatives won, has called for an investigation.  The Conservatives say all spending was recorded in accordance with the law.  Earlier this week, Channel 4 News said it had obtained hotel bills which suggested the party broke electoral rules in the Newark, Clacton and Rochester & Strood by-elections, the first of which the Conservatives won and the other two it lost to UKIP.  Conservative MP Robert Jenrick, who won the Newark contest, told BBC News he was "very confident" his election expenses were compiled "in complete compliance with the law".  "The allegations that were on Channel 4 News are, as far as I can see, completely unfounded," he added.  Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.  But Channel 4 News' political correspondent Michael Crick said he had uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.  The programme found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.  Michael Payne, who represented Labour in the Newark by-election, wrote to Nottinghamshire Police on Tuesday asking it to look into claims of "undeclared" spending by his rivals, saying he wanted reassurance that electoral laws and procedures had been complied with.  Nottinghamshire Police confirmed it had received an e-mail on the issue, adding: "This is the first communication we have received. The force will review the content of the communication, but we should make it clear that no investigation has been launched at this time."  The BBC understands that detectives in the Fraud and Financial Crimes Unit at Nottinghamshire Constabulary are handling the case.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage, whose party came second in Newark, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.  A Conservative spokeswoman, speaking on Wednesday, said: "All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35561246	Streetmap loses Google High Court challenge	A website that accused Google of abusing its position in the search market by "driving traffic" to Google Maps has lost its High Court action.  Streetmap said it had a "dramatic loss of traffic" following the launch of Google's "big map" service at the top of its search results page in 2007.  But in the ruling the judge said that, on the assumption Google held a "dominant position", it did not commit an abuse.  Streetmap said it would appeal.  In response to certain geographic queries, a clickable image from Google Maps - known as Maps OneBox - is displayed at the top of its search engine results pages.  UK-based Streetmap, which launched its online mapping services in 1997, argued that by having the clickable image and by the consequent relegation of a link to Streetmap lower down the page, Google was abusing its dominant position in the online search market.  The company had asked Mr Justice Roth to rule that Google had engaged in "anti-competitive conduct" contrary to provisions of the Competition Act 1998.  But the judge said the launch of Maps OneBox by Google was "not reasonably likely appreciably to affect competition" in the online map market, ruling that it was not important enough to be noticed.  He added that, in any event, Google's conduct was "objectively justified".  Speaking after the hearing, Streetmap director Kate Sutton said the decision was "unfair for small businesses".  "The decision makes it effectively impossible for a small business to bring a competition law complaint until it is too late, because the information required will simply not be known to them," she said.  "By raising the standard of proof from probability to 'appreciable effect' a complainant needs to have information which will usually only be known to the dominant company."  Tim Cowen, partner at law firm Preiskel & Co LLP, which acted for Streetmap, said: "This decision says that companies do not need to have evidence of compliance at the time, so long as they can find something later that may work as a defence.  "When Google introduced Google Maps in 2007 it did not check for effects outside the US and put forward no evidence that any check was performed for the UK.  "This decision raises a question what big companies need to do to show compliance with EU and UK law."  A Google spokesman said: "The court made clear that we're focused on improving the quality of our search results. This decision promotes innovation."  The ruling comes after the European Union filed a complaint against Google in April last year over its alleged anti-competitive behaviour.  The firm has said it "strongly disagreed" with the allegations and looked forward to making its case.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35558349	Tribunal rules computer hacking by GCHQ is not illegal	GCHQ is operating within the law when it hacks into computers and smart phones, a security tribunal has ruled.  Campaigners Privacy International have lost a legal challenge claiming the spying post's hacking operations are too intrusive and break European law.  The case was launched after revelations by US whistleblower Edward Snowden about the extent of US and UK spying.  GCHQ admitted its agents hack devices, in the UK and abroad, for the first time during the hearings.  Its previous policy had been to "neither confirm nor deny" the existence of such operations.  Hackers can remotely activate cameras and microphones on devices, without the owner's knowledge, log keystrokes, install malware, copy documents and track locations among other things, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) was told.  The Home Office has now published a code of practice for hacking, or "equipment interference" as it is also known, and aims to put it on a firmer legal footing in its Investigatory Powers Bill, which is due to become law later this year.  The Investigatory Powers Tribunal, a panel of senior judges, said in its ruling that the code struck the right balance between the "urgent need of the Intelligence Agencies to safeguard the public and the protection of an individual's privacy and/or freedom of expression".  But the judges were "satisfied" the agency was already operating in a lawful and proportionate way, whatever the outcome of Parliament's scrutiny of the Investigatory Powers Bill.  Privacy International, which launched the legal challenge with seven internet service providers, said it was "disappointed" by the ruling and would continue to challenge "state-sponsored hacking," which it said was "incompatible with democratic principles and human rights standards".  Scarlet Kim, Privacy International's legal officer, said: "Hacking is one of the most intrusive surveillance capabilities available to intelligence agencies.  "This case exposed not only these secret practices but also the undemocratic manner in which the government sought to backdate powers to do this under the radar.  "Just because the government magically produces guidelines for hacking should not legitimise this practice."  She added that hacking "fundamentally weakens the security of computers and the internet" by exploiting the "weaknesses in software and hardware used by millions of people".  "It is akin to unlocking a person's window without their knowledge and leaving it open for any attacker - whether GCHQ, another country's intelligence agency or a cyber criminal - to access."  "The ability to exploit computer networks plays a crucial part in our ability to protect the British public," he said.  "Once again, the law and practice around our Security and Intelligence Agencies' capabilities and procedures have been scrutinised by an independent body and been confirmed to be lawful and proportionate.  "The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will further strengthen the safeguards for the Agencies' use of these powers, including a new double-lock authorisation process.

But in 1997, devolution - the transfer of some powers from central to regional bases - entered a new phase.  That year, referendums were held in Scotland and Wales, with both parts of Ireland following in 1998.  These resulted in the creation of the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly.  Another major shake-up came in the form of the 2014 Scottish referendum. Although voters said "No" to full independence for Scotland, the period leading up to the vote led to an intense debate over what Scotland should be able to decide for itself.  The debate has already resulted in more powers being offered to the Scottish Parliament - and is likely to influence how the process of devolution continues, not just in Scotland, but across the UK.  Indeed, since its election in May 2015, the Conservative government has brought forward measures to devolve more powers away from Westminster. The devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales are to receive extra powers, and a number of "city regions", notably Greater Manchester have been granted extra control over some local spending and decisions.  The table below gives an overview of the main powers given to the Northern Irish and Welsh assemblies, and the Scottish Parliament. The UK government's proposals for the devolution of further powers to each constituent nation are discussed further below.  * Scotland has always had its own legal system  The UK government, led by the prime minister in Downing Street, is responsible for national policy on all powers which have not been devolved - known usually as "reserved powers".  The main areas which are reserved to Westminster are:  The Scottish Parliament sits at Holyrood in Edinburgh and is made up of 129 elected Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs), who scrutinise and pass bills in various areas of its many devolved responsibilities.  In addition to the main devolved powers, the Parliament can legislate on planning, natural and built heritage, sport and the arts, statistics, public registers and records.  But Holyrood will soon get control over more areas of Scottish life.  In the wake of the "No" vote in the Scottish independence referendum, all parties participated in the Smith Commission, a body which undertook to look at the devolution of further powers. Its recommendations form the basis of the 2015 Scotland Bill currently making its way through the UK parliament at Westminster. If agreed to, the Scottish Parliament will be granted powers over and around:  The SNP, which currently controls the Scottish government at Holyrood, says the proposals fall short of the mark and it continues to argue for full independence.  With polls suggesting that Nicola Sturgeon's party will again form a majority government at the forthcoming Scottish Parliament elections, the powers held by Edinburgh and Scotland's place in the Union will likely continue to be the matter of considerable debate.  The National Assembly for Wales sits at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay, and is made up of 60 elected Assembly Members (AMs). The Welsh government is its executive branch.  Since 2011 the Welsh assembly has had primary law-making powers over devolved areas, and in 2014 it gained tax-raising powers including stamp duty and landfill tax.  Arrangements are also in place for some powers over income tax; these were originally to be subject to approval in a referendum. This requirement has now been removed.  In addition, the assembly can make laws relating to ancient monuments and historic buildings, public administration, sport and recreation, tourism, town and country planning, flood defences, the assembly itself, and the Welsh language.  The government is currently consulting on a draft bill that would put devolution in Wales on a similar model to that in Scotland. Whereas powers are currently "conferred" on the Welsh Assembly, the UK government wants to move to a "reserved powers framework" whereby everything is devolved to Cardiff unless specifically stated otherwise. The bill also proposes the devolution of some transport and election powers.  The Northern Ireland Assembly sits at Stormont in Belfast, and is made up of 108 elected Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs).  The power-sharing agreement between the nationalist and unionist communities in Northern Ireland is critical to the functioning of the assembly; devolution of powers has been suspended and reinstated several times since it started in 1998.  Devolution here is slightly different to Scotland and Wales, with government powers divided into three categories: transferred, reserved and excepted.  In addition to the main devolved powers, the assembly can also legislate on culture, arts and leisure, learning and employment and regional and social development.  In March 2010, an agreement was passed to transfer powers of justice and policing to Northern Ireland.  As devolution to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has gathered pace, many people have argued that England's regions are being left behind.  There are two particular sources of tension.  The Treasury gives block grants to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to spend on devolved policy areas, calculated through the Barnett formula on the basis of population size.  Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish MPs' can vote on laws that only apply in England - which some people believe should be addressed through English votes on English laws, the idea that only English MPs should be able to vote on laws which predominantly affect England.  The Barnett formula is set to be revised as Scotland gets more tax-raising powers, but it is not clear whether there will be any similar reconsideration of the way it funds Wales and Northern Ireland.  To deal with "English votes for English laws" the government has come up with a complicated set of arrangements which MPs are currently trying on a trial basis.  A new stage has been added to the parliamentary process whereby consent is needed not just from the Commons as a whole, but also from MPs who sit for the relevant part of the UK. For example, English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.  On top of that, government plans are afoot for devolution to England's cities and regions, including through the introduction of elected mayors and "city regions".	politics

The US researchers analysed nearly 1.4 million users of the open source program-sharing service Github.  They found that pull requests - or suggested code changes - made on the service by women were more likely to be accepted than those by men.  This means the results have yet to be critically appraised by other experts.  The researchers, from the computer science departments at Caly Poly and North Carolina State University, looked at around four million people who logged on to Github on a single day - 1 April 2015.  Github is an enormous developer community which does not request gender information from its 12 million users.  However the team was able to identify whether roughly 1.4m were male or female - either because it was clear from the users' profiles or because their email addresses could be matched with the Google + social network.  The researchers accepted that this was a privacy risk but said they did not intend to publish the raw data.  The team found that 78.6% of pull requests made by women were accepted compared with 74.6% of those by men.  The researchers considered various factors, such as whether women were more likely to be responding to known issues, whether their contributions were shorter in length and so easier to appraise, and which programming language they were using, but they could not find a correlation.  However among users who were not well known within the community, those whose profiles made clear that they were women had a much lower acceptance rate than those whose gender was not obvious.  "For outsiders, we see evidence for gender bias: women's acceptance rates are 71.8% when they use gender neutral profiles, but drop to 62.5% when their gender is identifiable . There is a similar drop for men, but the effect is not as strong," the paper noted.  "Women have a higher acceptance rate of pull requests overall, but when they're outsiders and their gender is identifiable, they have a lower acceptance rate than men.  "Our results suggest that although women on Github may be more competent overall, bias against them exists nonetheless," the researchers concluded.  Despite various high profile initiatives, tech firms continue to face challenges in terms of the diversity of their staff, in terms of both gender and ethnicity, particularly in more technical careers.  Just 16% of Facebook's tech staff and 18% of Google's are women according to figures released in 2015.  However the researchers' findings are still encouraging, computer scientist Dr Sue Black OBE told the BBC.  "I think we are going to see a resurgence of interest from women in not only coding but all sorts of tech-related careers over the next few years," she said.  "Knowing that women are great at coding gives strength to the case that it's better for everyone to have more women working in tech.  "It was a woman - Ada Lovelace - who came up with the idea of software in the first place, we owe it to her to make sure that we encourage and support women into the software industry," Dr Black added.	tech

Since India's telecoms regulator banned Facebook's Free Basics on Monday the row over the social network's motives in offering a free but limited mobile internet service has deepened.  When Marc Andreessen waded in, the temperature rose to boiling point. The legendary Silicon Valley venture capitalist and Facebook board member was contemptuous of India's ban on Free Basics, then tweeted: "Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the lndian people for decades. why stop now?" He deleted the tweet but not before his words were held up as an example of Silicon Valley's arrogance towards developing countries.  I'm talking to Mahesh Murthy, a tech entrepreneur who clashed with Marc Andreessen on Twitter and was then blocked. He says he's lived in Silicon Valley and is a fan - but says there is still an arrogant "masters of the Universe" attitude there which assumes that Americans know what's good for India.  Dave Lee in San Francisco speaks to Om Malik, the technology journalist who's been based in Silicon Valley for many years. He's more sympathetic to Facebook, believing Mark Zuckerberg's motives are essentially altruistic - but says Silicon Valley's boundless optimism can blind it to the realities of life in India.  The fallout from last year's hacking of the toy company VTech continues. This week it emerged that the company had slipped out some new terms and conditions which warned parents that there was no guarantee that its online products could not be hacked again. They were told to "acknowledge and agree that any information you send or receive during your use of the site may not be secure and may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorised parties".  The security researcher Scott Helme tells us what happens when you first turn on a VTech children's tablet. He says VTech has a point when it says no company can guarantee it won't be hacked - but it still should shoulder the responsibility if it happens.  We will also get our special guest Professor Angela Sasse, head of information security research at University College London, to give her take on the story.  By the way, we tried to put a few questions to VTech about trust in its technology last month at London's Toy Fair. You can see what happened here.  This week saw another example of the boom in investment in artificial intelligence. A Silicon Valley-based company called Diffbot raised $10m from investors who had backed firms like Google and Tesla in the past. Diffbot is teaching computers to read the web and understand it just like humans do - in other words, look at this page and say that's about a radio programme called Tech Tent and this picture is of Mark Zuckerberg so it must relate to a story about Facebook. It doesn't sound hard - but this simple task has proved a big challenge for AI researchers. Mike Tung of Diffbot talks us through the technology - and reveals that unlike most AI ventures, this is a business which actually makes money.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35559244	John Bercow: Speaker's entertainment bill revealed	Commons Speaker John Bercow has spent thousands of pounds on entertaining other MPs and foreign politicians since April 2012, including £1,600 on a lunch for his Lithuanian counterpart.  The Press Association has published details of expenditure from Mr Bercow's official House account, obtained under Freedom of Information rules.  It includes £1,023 for beeswax candles and £286 to tune a grand piano.  The Speaker's office said spending was 19% lower than under his predecessor.  Mr Bercow has been Speaker since 2009, when he replaced Michael Martin - who stepped down amid the Commons expenses scandal.  He is not subject to such stringent rules on expenses as other MPs, whose claims for food and drink are capped. MPs travelling outside their constituency on parliamentary business can claim £25 a day on food and drink, excluding alcohol.  According to the Press Association, Mr Bercow spent £2,223.34 on a dinner for the "panel of chairs" - a group of MPs who chair public bill committees - in January 2010. In 2015, he spent £2,057 on a dinner to mark the retirement of former Deputy Speaker and Labour MP Dawn Primarolo.  Up to £7,400 has been charged to the taxpayer, since 2012, on annual receptions for members of Parliament following the State Opening of Parliament while £3,000 was spent on a reception for new MPs in July 2015.  Spending on functions for foreign parliamentarians are also recorded in the figures. A lunch for the Romanian Speaker in December 2012 cost £1,521.37 while a similar event for the Slovenian Speaker a year later cost £1,444.74.  A dinner in honour of the Australian Speaker in May 2014 cost £1,954.38.  Other miscellaneous items of spending included £286 on tuning the grand piano in Speaker's House which is "available for members to use upon request". Official postcard-size portrait photographs of the Speaker and senior officials taken at the State Opening of Parliament, which are available "on request", cost £307 to produce in November 2014 and £210 in December 2012.  An order for "hand-finished" beeswax candles was made in July 2012, to be used for official gatherings in the State Rooms.  A spokeswoman for the Speaker's Office said they were not querying the figures but defended the outlay, saying every Speaker in modern times has hosted receptions for MPs after the State Opening and the cost of doing so had fallen by 77% since 2009.  She said it was "long-established practice" for the Speaker to pay for drinks ahead of the panel of chairs' annual dinner, which he did not routinely attend, while the Speaker was traditionally expected to host occasions for foreign dignitaries and to mark the departure of retiring and new MPs.  She said the Speaker was committed to cutting costs wherever possible and total spending by the Speaker's Office had fallen from £626,029 in 2009-10, the year in which he was elected, to £504,737 in 2014-15.  "These costs relate to nearly four years of expenditure including, among other things, staff pay, office supplies, telephone calls and rental as well as the official entertainment of foreign dignitaries and parliamentarians traditionally provided by the Speaker's Office," she said.  The Press Association said the Commons was unable to supply any information prior to April 2012 since it had been "destroyed in accordance with the parliamentary records disposal policy".  Pressure group the Taxpayers Alliance said no-one "begrudged" the Speaker for footing the bill for official functions he was responsible for hosting and it was encouraging that overall spending by his office had fallen.  But it said all spending by the Speaker's office should be made public as a matter of course so it could be subject to "proper scrutiny".  Details of Mr Bercow's travel expenses are published every year. Between April 2014 and April 2015, he claimed more than £31,000 in travel and accommodation expenses, figure published last July showed.	politics

As the lawsuits represent around 25 million US Uber customers, this amounts to an individual payout of just over a dollar each.  The proceedings claimed that the lift-hailing app was charging a "safe ride fee" but not carrying out adequate background checks on its drivers.  Uber said it would rename the charge a "booking fee".  It also pledged to change the wording of its advertising to avoid safety-related language.  The settlement requires court approval and applies to journeys booked in the US between 1 January 2013 and 1 January 2016.  "We are glad to put these cases behind us and we will continue to invest in new technology and great customer services so that we can help improve safety in the cities we serve," the firm said in a statement.  Uber track its drivers' cars via GPS and shares a photo of the driver with customers before they get in the car.  "No means of transportation can ever be 100% safe. Accidents and incidents do happen," it added.  "That's why it's important to ensure that the language we use to describe safety at Uber is clear and precise."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35559592	Is Google feeling unloved?	There was a painful moment in this week's UK parliamentary hearing about Google's tax affairs when the company's European boss Matt Brittin was asked to reveal his pay.  He hesitated, and then said "I don't have the figure but I will happily provide it." Now this turned out to be the worst possible answer - the MP who had asked the question was able to point out that anyone who didn't even know the size of their own pay packet must live in a different world from most people.  A better answer might have been that, like any commercial business, Google was not required to disclose the salaries of executives other than those on the main board - which Mr Brittin is not - so the politician should not be so nosy.  The trouble is that Google has never wanted to be just any old business. It sees itself as having a higher mission - and it wants to be admired, even loved.  Back in 2004, in the offer document sent to potential shareholders when the search firm floated, the two founders said this: "Google is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one." And they expanded on that by explaining that "don't be evil" would be the principle by which this unconventional company would be run.  The search engine giant is not alone amongst technology companies in this desire to paint itself as being on a higher mission than mere sordid money-making. Ever since Facebook's arrival on the stock market, it has talked far more about its desire to help people share and connect than any of that tedious stuff like growing profits and boosting shareholder value.  But of course once you become a public company, with a duty to update investors on your finances every three months, that mission thing becomes harder to sustain. Your offices may still be full of ping pong tables and free food but your tax planning department is occupying a whole floor.  Over in Washington DC your corporate lobbyists are hard at work, and they're wearing suits and ties not jeans and t-shirts. And your remuneration committee is looking at the competition and saying: "Our chief executive has transformed the business into the world's most valuable company, so we had better reward him with a healthy chunk of shares or he might go elsewhere." In other words, Google has in many ways become the conventional company that its founders were so sniffy about back in 2004.  And when it comes to paying taxes, just like Facebook and other technology giants, Google is no less adept at organising its affairs in the most efficient way than any other multinational. It's not its fault that there are all these clever wheezes to shift profits around the world to minimise tax liabilities - and to fail to take advantage of these loopholes would amount to negligence in the eyes of many shareholders.  So when politicians, journalists and the public ask rude questions about how Google can pay its chief executive more in one year than it hands over to the British tax authorities, the company should have a simple answer. You make the rules, we obey them - if you don't like it make some new rules, otherwise go away and leave us alone.  That is, in essence, what Google has been saying - except that something of that "don't be evil" ethos still seems to lurk at the back of the corporate mind. Its executives still want the company to be loved, so try in vain to assuage the anger about those tiny tax payments rather than shrug their shoulders and get on with the job.  The strange thing is that many of the millions who use the services of Google, Facebook and other tech giants seem to have bought into the illusion that they are charitable organisations rather than businesses.  When I wrote this week about Twitter's apparently doomed quest to attract new users without alienating the old ones, an angry Tweeter responded in apparent shock: "It's all about the money", adding the hashtag #RIPTwitter.  Whatever dreams they start with - and hold on to - it is all about the money for technology companies. At least, that is, if they want to survive and grow into the kind of businesses that can pay their bosses $200m a year.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35543194	Snowballs, handstands and famous sons	It was 80 years ago this week that the two million acre constituency of Ross and Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands was the scene of one of the most farcical by-elections of the 20th Century.  The National Government had just won the general election, and Malcolm MacDonald, son of former Prime Minister Ramsay, had lost his seat - but not his place in the cabinet - so he needed to get back to the Commons as quickly as possible.  This meant despite being a National Labour candidate MacDonald had the backing of Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin.  The endorsement of MacDonald really irked the local Unionist association, particularly the farmers - who were expected to fall into line and support him, but they wouldn't - they called on Randolph Churchill, son of Winston to stand for them instead.  So this was a battle with two famous politician's sons, but not only that - the Churchill and MacDonald families had a history of clashes and recrimination going back 30 years.  Winston Churchill's grandson Sir Nicholas Soames MP says Randolph Churchill stood for the seat against his father's advice.  "Randolph was incredibly impetuous and he didn't want to be told what to do by his father."  Sir Nicholas says that Winston Churchill's own father had been "beastly to him" and he therefore was determined to have a good relationship with Randolph, but all that he did was "spoil him rotten".  Randolph was a strange sight arriving in Dingwall with a large cabin trunk and golf clubs, addressing meetings wearing a red waistcoat with gold buttons.  His manner irritated many people - and MacDonald's supporters felt, with their man being a Scotsman and Highlander, this could only help their campaign.  Calamity was never far away from this contest - terrible weather left roads impassable. The Labour candidate Hector MacNeil crashed his car twice.  The Ross-shire Journal reported that Malcolm MacDonald was hit "in a bespectacled eye" during a snowball fight. The broken glass scarred his eye - leaving him out of the race for several days.  The next drama was the death of King George V but rather than creating a moment of unity the candidates immediately fell out over whether they should stop campaign as a mark of respect.  Finally the weather started to thaw, but the rivalries didn't. The night before the vote MacDonald spoke from a balcony on the National Hotel in Dingwall - so Randolph Churchill started speaking loudly from a balcony at the other side of the hotel in an attempt to drown out his opponent.  At the declaration 2,000 people gathered at the town hall, blocking the street. When the Sheriff simply announced MacDonald's name the cheering was so loud he couldn't continue for several minutes.  MacDonald had won. His nearly 9,000 votes gave him a comfortable majority over Hector McNeil's respectable 6,000. Randolph Churchill should have listened to his father's advice not to stand, as he trailed in third with just under 2,500.  Back at the National Hotel for the celebration party, MacDonald's team found Churchill sitting alone and invited him to join them.  It had been a tough fight and MacDonald treated the party-goers to a fine piece of gymnastics as he walked the length of the room on his hands.  Randolph was heard to say: "I'd rather be able to do that than win Ross and Cromarty."	politics

It emerged earlier this week that the toy company had changed its terms to say that families using its software did so at their "own risk".  This prompted a backlash in which some security experts suggested parents should boycott its products.  The UK's Toy Retailers Association has since said VTech remains "reputable".  However, at least two major stores have told the BBC that they are in talks with the Hong Kong-based manufacturer to decide how to proceed.  VTech was alerted to the fact it had been hacked in November when it was contacted by the Motherboard news site.  It later confirmed that more than 6.3 million children's accounts and 4.8 million parent accounts had been compromised.  Photos, voice messages, and chat conversations between the adults and their children were among the profile data exposed.  The company later hired the security firm FireEye and subsequently restored its Learning Lodge app management platform at the end of last month.  But it caused further controversy when it changed its European terms and conditions to state parents must assume "full responsibility" for using its software.  "You acknowledge and agree that any information you send or receive during your use of the site may not be secure and may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorised parties," it added.  "Use of the site and any software or firmware downloaded therefrom is at your own risk."  The firm told the BBC that the move was intended to help protect itself from legal claims.  "The Learning Lodge terms and conditions, like the T&Cs for many online sites and services, simply recognise that fact by limiting the company's liability for the acts of third parties such as hackers," a spokeswoman explained.  "Such limitations are commonplace on the web."  The terms include the caveat that VTech only absolves itself of responsibility in so far as "applicable laws" allow it to do so.  The Information Commissioner's Office has confirmed that this would not be possible in the UK.  "The law is clear that it is organisations handling people's personal data that are responsible for keeping that data secure," said a spokeswoman.  A data protection specialist added that this would be the case for other EU countries too.  "If VTech did suffer another breach, some people might be dissuaded from bringing a claim because of the terms and conditions, or VTech might be trying to give themselves room to argue that they aren't liable," said Paul Glass from the law firm Taylor Wessing.  "But under European and UK law the obligation is on the company in control of the data to take appropriate steps to protect the information from unauthorised disclosure or access.  "Even if VTech did try and argue that people were contractually prohibited from bringing a claim, it is a difficult position for the firm to take."  Two of the UK's leading retailers told the BBC that they had contacted VTech to discuss its approach.  "The security of our customers' personal data is of the utmost importance to us," said Argos.  "We are aware of the story relating to VTech and we are in conversations with them to learn more before taking any action."  John Lewis added: "We are in active conversations with VTech around this issue and are looking at reviewing how we communicate the use of the Learning Lodge to customers as a result."  The Toy Retailers Association, which represents much of the trade, was more robust in its defence of the firm.  "VTech are and have been a reputable supplier of toys and [were] subject to an indiscriminate hacker," said the body's chairman Alan Simpson.  "Under the circumstances they have and will continue to take all reasonable precautions to protect their customers.  "But like everyone else a hacker does not play by any moral rules."  Some security experts, however, remain critical of VTech's handling of the breach.  "No company can protect 100% against the possibility of being hacked, but taking sufficient precautions and ensuring a good level of security is maintained should be the fundamentals of any policy where users' private data is being held," commented Mark James from the cybersecurity firm Eset.  "To shift ownership over to the users is bad enough in itself but to make it known through walls of text in T&Cs is a bad way to do it - no one honestly reads it, especially a parent trying to set up something for their children.  "Our minors' data should be ultra-important for any organisation and protecting that should be their number one priority. If voting with your feet is the best way to make them understand, then maybe that's the right thing to do."	tech

Mr Benn highlighted global political dangers as he insisted the case for staying in is "stronger than ever".  But Vote Leave, one of the groups campaigning for an exit, accused him of resorting to scare tactics.  It comes as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the UK still has "issues" with a proposed EU reform package.  "There is no deal at present; there is a working draft," he said.  "We have issues, some of which have been addressed - language issues - in the latest iteration of the draft, some of which have not been addressed," Mr Hammond told reporters in Brussels.  "So the discussions continue and I do not think it is sensible to draw any conclusions about the shape of the deal until we see the final text that emerges from the European Council meeting," he added.  David Cameron is hoping to secure a deal on the proposed reforms at the EC meeting in Brussels next week, paving the way for a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU in June.  Delivering a speech at the Chatham House think-tank in London, Hilary Benn said leaving the European Union would mean the UK was less able to deal with international challenges such as the migrant crisis and climate change.  Referring to Russian action in the Crimea and Ukraine, Mr Benn said it was down to "Europe's collective response that we have been able to exert real pressure and have an impact".  "Efforts towards the creation of an EU-wide energy union will, over time, weaken Russia's dominance as an energy supplier in Europe," he added.  "Let's be clear. President Putin would shed no tears if Britain left the European Union. He would see Brexit as a sign of our weakness and of the weakness of European solidarity at the very moment when we need to maintain our collective strength."  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the Vote Leave campaign, hit back at Mr Benn's claims.  "Pro-EU campaigners cannot make a positive case for remaining in a political project that is incapable of dealing with the challenges of the 21st century," he said.  "Instead of accepting that we need a new relationship with the EU, they are whipping up fear about dictators and economic doom despite the fact that neither are remotely credible.  "Voting Leave is the safe option as it will allow us to make our own trade deals, end the supremacy of EU law and invest in our priorities."  Mr Benn also used his speech to restate his position on the replacement of Britain's Trident nuclear weapons, which are at odds with those of his party's leader Jeremy Corbyn.  He said other nuclear powers would not throw their missiles "in the dustbin" if the UK unilaterally disarmed.  "I think you get there by multilateral negotiation and not by unilateral action," he said.  "If we gave ours up I don't believe for a second that any one of the other nuclear powers in the world would say 'well if you're not going to keep yours any more we'll throw ours in the dustbin'."  Labour is carrying out a review of its defence policy, including whether Trident should be renewed.	politics

It said the Pope and other clergy would use the app to broadcast recordings of Gospel readings and commentary during the Christian festival.  It also said it had ditched WhatsApp, the platform it used last year, saying Telegram was "better".  Telegram lets users send highly encrypted messages but has gained notoriety for its use by so-called Islamic State.  According to the Vatican, subscribers to the Telegram channel @pgpompei will receive the religious messages from Ash Wednesday until Easter.  According to Telegram, the channel had over 5,600 subscribers on Thursday. The Vatican was closed so unable to comment on the campaign's progress, but Telegram told the BBC it welcomed the news.  Telegram was set up by the two brothers who founded VKontakte - a Russian social networking site inspired by Facebook - and claimed in December to have 50 million monthly users.  The free app allows users to send strongly encrypted messages to phones, tablets and computers, without detection by outsiders.  Users can also create groups for up to 1,000 people, or channels for broadcasting to unlimited audiences. The BBC itself has a number of channels on the platform.  However, Telegram attracted controversy last year when the so-called Islamic State group (IS) said it had shifted its propaganda distribution to the app from Twitter, where its accounts had been repeatedly shut down.  Officials investigating last year's Paris attacks also found that some of the attackers had used Telegram, and its rival WhatsApp, to plot and communicate.  Following criticism, Telegram's founders said they had blocked 78 public channels of ISIS propaganda In November.  In his first broadcast using the app, Pope Francis reflected on the Gospel reading from the Ash Wednesday Mass - in which Jesus warns against practising good works so others may see them.  "When we do something good, sometimes we are tempted to seek praise and to be rewarded: that's human glory," he said.  "But it's a false reward because it makes us focus on what others think of us."	tech

The compositions - which are coupled with moving emoji designs - last just five seconds and can be sent to friends over the messaging platform for free.  The musician said he had at first considered the project a "strange proposition" but then changed his mind.  "I thought, you know what, why not? Something fun, and nice and new."  A video shows the 73-year-old in the studio creating short tunes for 10 emojis, which capture emotions such as "flirting", "blushing", "love" and "lust".  He uses instruments including the Moog synthesizer, harpsichord and electric guitar, as well as his voice, although the so-called "Love Mojis" contain no lyrics.  "It turned out to be a great laugh at the same time as challenging, as you suddenly realise you've got to compress a musical interpretation of an emotion into less than five seconds," he said in an interview on his website.  "So with some of them, which were five and a half or six seconds, we had to work out a way to take the front off or just squeeze this or just take that bit out."  The recording project, which he thought might take a day, ended up taking a week, he added.  Some emotions had been harder to capture than others.  "There were a couple that were more challenging; 'flirting' and 'blushing'," he said.  "But I just kind of had a go at it and thought, 'There you go!' And then if I didn't think it was enough, I might just add another instrument to try and get the feeling."  Skype's Mojis, which were launched last September, differ from emoticons in that they can feature sound and video.  Head of MIDiA Research Mark Mulligan said the partnership with Sir Paul made sense, because messaging platforms were "the next place digital audiences congregate".  "First there were websites, then social networks and now messaging platforms which number more than five billion monthly active users globally," he told the BBC.  "Skype is trying to reinvent itself in this environment and has clearly considered investing in a 'partnership' with Paul McCartney a useful tactic.  "However, if Skype wants to build the same sort of relevance with younger users that Snapchat and Instagram have, it should really be exploring opportunities with artists two or three generations younger."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35553408	Analysis: What MPs say is wrong with spy bill	Everyone agrees a new law governing surveillance powers is required but the devil is in the detail, as a series of parliamentary reports have illustrated.  The existing law, all agree, is complex and lacking in transparency but all the signs are that the new one has not yet overcome this problem entirely.  The Joint Parliamentary Committee makes 86 recommendations overall but the central thrust is that while the direction of the draft bill is broadly correct, the government still needs to make significant changes, particularly in making a number of provisions clearer.  The bill aims to takes powers which were previously exercised using often obscure legal provisions and put them onto a clearer footing.  But one of the most controversial provisions is a new power - to compel companies to keep Internet Connection Records (ICRs) for 12 months which detail the sites everyone visits on the web (although not what exact page).  Not enough has been done to explain what is involved, the committee says.  Law enforcement rather than spies are the chief sponsors of this provision and the committee gives them support for the overall concept (even adding that they could be expanded to identify people visiting websites which hold illegal material rather than just for identifying forms of communication).  However, it says that more needs to be done on the detail. In particular there are problems over defining ICRs, over the technical feasibility of their collection and storage as well as the costs involved. All of this may make it challenging to deliver them in the timescale envisaged.  Bulk Personal Datasets are another area of concern.  Clear justifications and operational cases for why the powers are required remain lacking, the committee says, also criticising government for being unwilling to provide much detail of what kinds of datasets would be involved.  Some might be obvious such as passport records but others - like health records - would be far more sensitive.  It is notable in the report that the committee tried to get an answer on whether records such as health data would be excluded but was not given one by government.  There is relatively little detail on the issue of encryption which has been of concern to many companies (notably Apple which submitted detailed evidence).  A report from the Science and Technology Committee raised concerns from industry about the potential impact of ambiguity in some provisions.  The indications are that the government wants to retain its right to seek unencrypted data even if it knows it may not always be possible to obtain it.  There are still some concerns from industry over what is meant when its said that companies need to take "practicable" steps to provide such data and what impact it has on end-to-end encryption systems.  Some companies also remain concerned they could be compelled to hack into their own products under equipment interference provisions.  The Joint Committee also calls for some significant changes to the way in which judges provide oversight over powers to increase independence.  On intelligence sharing, the Joint Committee also notably calls for it to be made illegal to get another country to spy on behalf of a UK agency or body when it does not have the authorisation to collect such information.  The legislation is often technical by necessity and so a lot of weight is placed on "codes of practice" which outline how exactly the powers should be used. The committee say these should be published along with the bill to provide greater transparency and clarity.  The Intelligence and Security Committee report earlier in the week focused more narrowly on intelligence agency powers but took a tougher line.  It criticised the lack of an over-arching privacy protection and also said that when challenged about what the power of bulk equipment interference actually involved, officials were unable to provide an answer.  The committee have rejected the idea of a sunset clause in which the powers would expire after five years instead calling for a joint committee to review the use of the powers as the five year point approached.  There were clearly differences of opinion within the committee and despite the huge amount of evidence it took, some still feel it may have had to rush.  One member, Lord Strasburger argued the government had not learnt the lesson of drafting a bill too broadly and said that essential information was missing that parliament needed in order to decide if the powers were necessary and proportionate.  The issue now is how far the Home Office takes on board some of the criticisms and whether there is enough time to do so - a final bill is due to be introduced soon so that it can be debated and passed by the end of the year.	politics

The IKO Creative Prosthetic System won the Grand Prix award at digital technology summit Netexplo.  Lego attachments, including a remote-control digger, fit on to the battery-powered arm and 3D-printed socket.  Creator Carlos Arturo Torres, a former intern at Lego's Future Lab research department, hopes to secure investment for its development this year.  He told the BBC: "I'm super happy with it.  "As a Colombian, you grow up with the arms conflict and we are so aware of people losing limbs or having difficulties because of war."  Mr Torres hopes children will work together to design their own attachments.  "When I was at Lego, I realised how social toys can be," he said.  Mr Torres estimates the prosthetic will sell for $5,000 (£3,500) with a fee of $1,000 for each 3D-printed sockets, bought as the wearer grows out of the old ones.  Jo Dixon, national co-ordinator at Children's charity Reach, said using cheaper materials in the construction of prosthetics made them "far more affordable" for children and easier to maintain.  "The popularity of the new, simple 3D versions, including a build-your-own Lego kit, with their robotic appearance and bespoke colours means that they can help to increase self-confidence," she told the BBC.  "[This can] help with the acceptance of difference rather than being a functional replacement hand."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35544789	Spy law needs significant changes, says parliamentary committee	The draft Investigatory Powers Bill will force internet service providers to store all web activity for a year.  It will also authorise the bulk collection of personal data and hacking of smartphones by Britain's spies.  Ministers say the changes will help to catch terrorists and tackle organised crime by updating laws to fit the new technology being used by criminals.  But civil liberties campaigners claim the measures contained in it amount to mass surveillance of UK citizens - and that the committee's report meant the home secretary needed to go "back to the drawing board".  Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: "This report shows just how much homework the government has to do on this landmark legislation."  Labour's shadow home secretary Andy Burnham has written to Mrs May to say that while Labour supports the overall aim of the bill - to give police and security services the powers they need - the government must now take time to reconsider its plans to ensure they strike "the right balance for our security and privacy".  Mrs May said the government would "carefully consider" the conclusions of three committees which have reported on the Bill before presenting its final proposals.  "This is vital legislation, and we are absolutely determined to get it right.  "Our draft Bill followed three independent reports on investigatory powers, whose authors were unanimous a new law was necessary.  "We are clear we need to introduce legislation which responds to the threats we face in the digital age, protects both the privacy and security of the public, and provides world-leading oversight and safeguards."  Communications firms - such as your broadband or mobile phone providers - will be compelled to hold a year's worth of your communications data.  In simple terms, police say they want to be able to get at these records, going back a year, so that if they get a lead on a suspect, they can establish more about their network or conspiracy.  Under existing law, agencies can already ask firms to start collecting this data - but they can't access historic information because companies don't keep it. Police argue that this means many investigations into crime with an online element go cold because they can't link activity to specific people or devices.  The Joint Committee on the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill said in a 194 page report it was satisfied the value of so-called Internet Connection Records to law enforcement agencies "could outweigh the intrusiveness involved in collecting and using them".  But it echoed concerns from tech firms about the feasibility of protecting users' privacy in the way Mrs May has promised, by only collecting the names of websites visited, rather than individual web pages.  The committee was told this might not be technically possible, but it said the Home Office was working with the industry to find a solution.  Ministers must also spell out their plans on encryption to ensure that they will not force tech firms to provide a "back door" for spies, the parliamentary committee said.  And the Home Office must also provide greater justification for the sweeping up of emails and other internet traffic passing through the UK by the security services, as revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden, and other so-called "bulk" data gathering exercises.  Committee chairman Lord Murphy of Torfaen said the Home Office had a "significant amount of further work to do before Parliament can be confident that the provisions have been fully thought through".  The bill was criticised as "a dragnet approach" and "disproportionate" by former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who blocked Mrs May's previous attempt to pass spying legislation, dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, when he was in government.  The Lib Dem MP told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Home Office wanted to "collect everything on everyone" in order to find the information on suspected terrorists or criminals they are looking for.  "Implying that everyone may be guilty when millions of innocent people are just going about their everyday business free of any wrongdoing at all is... something which is not in keeping with long-standing British traditions," Mr Clegg said.  He asked if it was "proportionate in a liberal democracy to retain information on everything from the music you download on Spotify, to the app that you open, to the supermarket website that you visit, in order to go after the bad guys?"  He said he favoured a "narrower approach" to data retention, and that other countries concentrate on collecting data on those people who "flicker on the radar screen of security services in the first place."  Much of the vast bill is devoted to the activities of Britain's intelligence agencies, and is focused on making clear the legal basis under which they operate, following Edward Snowden's revelations.  It proposes "equipment interference" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.  Other warrants will cover the downloading of "bulk" databases of personal data, which could include medical records, and the sweeping up internet traffic passing through the UK for future analysis by GCHQ.  Some of these techniques were not known to the public until recently and were covered by disparate and obscure pieces of legislation, some of which predated the internet.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35548540	Lithium-ion battery air shipments face scrutiny in US	The US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has said shipments of lithium-ion batteries on planes should be restricted due to safety fears.  Lithium-ion batteries should be physically separated from flammable hazardous material, the NTSB said.  It also wants to limit the quantity of such batteries, used to power many portable devices, allowed as cargo.  A US senator is now calling for authorities to be able to ban lithium-ion batteries from aircraft.  The NTSB said gadget batteries could be "a fire and explosion ignition source", "a source of fuel to an existing fire" and "subjected to overheating that can create an explosive condition."  The updated advice follows an investigation into a fire on an Asiana Airlines cargo plane in 2011.  Two crew members died when the plane, which was carrying lithium-ion batteries, then crashed into the Korea Strait.  NTSB chairman Christopher A Hart said the body's recommendations would "reduce the likelihood and severity of potential cargo fires" and "provide additional time for the crew to safely land a cargo aircraft in the event a fire is detected".  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) also said this week there was "potential risk of a catastrophic aircraft loss" due to damage resulting from a lithium-ion battery fire.  Current procedures for dealing with cargo fires on planes were incapable of controlling a lithium-ion battery blaze, the FAA added.  The FAA arrived at these conclusions following testing of lithium-ion batteries and methods to extinguish fires caused by them.  US senator Bill Nelson now plans to introduce legislation that would allow the FAA to ban lithium-ion shipments.  "If FAA testing has found that fires or explosions caused by lithium-ion batteries can lead to a catastrophic loss of an airplane, then why on Earth would anyone want to prohibit safety regulators from banning large shipments of these batteries on passenger airliners," Mr Nelson told news site The Hill.  The Air Line Pilots Association has also suggested the FAA should have greater powers to restrict lithium-ion shipments.  Any new regulations would not apply to individual batteries contained in devices carried by air passengers.	tech

Pensions scheme members reported "hardship, distress and inconvenience" caused by the late payment of pensions, the NAO said.  MyCSP said its performance was now back to a "steady state".  The PCS union said the mutualisation had been "a textbook case in how not to reform public services".  MyCSP, a joint venture between government and private sector firm Equiniti, took over civil service pensions administration from Capita in September 2014.  In a report on Thursday Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office said the mutual "did not cope with the workload and a large backlog of work built up".  "Some people were paid late and members struggled to contact MyCSP," he added.  Due to a lack of staff, a backlog of work grew, peaking at 22,000 urgent cases in January 2015, and many thousands of calls went unanswered.  Between September 2014 and March 2015, MyCSP failed to answer 99,408 calls, the NAO said.  The mutual was unable to prioritise urgent cases once a backlog had built up because of the way its system ran, NAO added.  In January 2015 the Cabinet Office told the mutual to develop a plan to tackle the backlog.  By September 2015 MyCSP had managed to re-establish previous performance levels and was not hit with any financial penalties, the NAO added.  MyCSP said: "We recognise the findings of the National Audit Office report published today.  "It has been well documented that a number of factors led to the reduction in service levels, including a communication to 1.1 million members which resulted in significantly increased call volumes and a corresponding impact on 'business as usual' workload."  It added that it had recruited new staff, increased call centre opening times, and started in-house training.  "Call handling levels have been back to normal for the past six months, with a corresponding reduction in member complaints, significantly down from their peak at the time of the service challenges," it said.  "Service to members remains our utmost priority and we will continue to work with... the Cabinet Office and employers to deliver towards that aim," MyCSP added.  The PCS union said the NAO report had "exposed the failings of the government's only mutual venture in a damning verdict on the administration of civil service pensions".  The new pension administration IT system, Compendia, was not fully ready when MyCSP took on the extra work, PCS said.  Compendia was developed by Equiniti, which took over a controlling stake in the mutual in 2014, PCS added.  PCS general secretary Mark Serwotka said: "The mutualisation of MyCSP has from the start been a textbook case in how not to reform public services."	politics

Under the "right to be forgotten" ruling, EU citizens may ask search engines to remove information about them.  Now, removed results will not appear on any version of Google when viewed from Europe.  EU privacy regulators previously asked the firm to do this.  Until now, search results removed under the "right to be forgotten" were only omitted from European versions of Google - such as google.co.uk or google.fr.  The French data protection authority had threatened the company with a fine if it did not remove the data from global sites - such as google.com - as well as European ones like.  This filtering will be applied whenever a European IP address is detected - so users outside Europe will still see a set of unedited results.

He was attempting to limit the damage caused by a tweet that could have far-reaching consequences as he continues to expand Facebook around the world.  When Marc Andreessen dismissed India's decision to block Facebook's "free" mobile internet scheme as "anti-colonialism", he stoked the fears of those who believe Zuckerberg's stated philanthropic ambitions are actually a front for his desire to dominate the internet in the developing world.  "I found the comments deeply upsetting," Zuckerberg wrote on Tuesday, as uproar grew.  "They do not represent the way Facebook or I think at all."  Andreessen, an early Facebook investor, has apologised - and deleted his tweet.  It's damaging because it hits right to heart of what is a perennial problem for Facebook: trust.  In the developed world, every privacy policy change and feature addition is met with fierce investigation.  And that's because people want to know why? Why, for instance, does Facebook use face-recognition software on our photos? Why does Facebook insist we use our real names?  The answer - to help us organise our digital and real lives - is only partially satisfactory to some.  That may be so, users say, but... why else?  In the developing world this suspicion is more fraught.  Of the world's top 100 billionaires, Zuckerberg currently comes in at number eight. Much of Facebook's value, and therefore his, is down to the phenomenal growth the network has enjoyed since its launch in 2004.  This needs to continue, but with more than half of the entire online world already using Facebook, it needs to expand deeper into emerging economies.  It's why Zuckerberg spent $22bn (£15.2bn) to buy messaging service Whatsapp. It's likely why he has wooed China by going to great lengths to learn Mandarin.  And it's why he gave up his trademark hoody and jeans to instead wear a suit to welcome the Indian Prime Minister to Facebook's campus last year.  If he was going to be accepted in India, he needed to build bridges and gain trust.  And it's why Marc Andreessen's comment, as a member of Facebook's board, is so damaging - it's put Zuckerberg once again on the back foot.  Because colonialism, albeit digital, is precisely what some in India were afraid of.  The suggestion by Andreessen that India, with its history, should somehow be pro-colonialism was treated by many as absurd.  In centuries gone by, colonialism was about exploitation of resources. In the modern world, it's digital - moving in, setting up companies and building insurmountable user bases before any other company can.  That's arguably an extreme interpretation of the purpose of Free Basics - but it's the argument made by local businesses to India's telecoms regulator.  An Indian social network wouldn't stand a chance against free Facebook, they said, and websites that are not part of the Free Basics scheme would lose out. The regulator agreed when it ruled in favour of net neutrality.  As did many Western onlookers. The Electronic Frontier Foundation, which campaigns for an open internet, said Facebook was doing what it could to open up the Free Basics scheme to local companies, the inherent flaw of the program was that Facebook remained the sole gatekeeper.  After Free Basics was banned, Zuckerberg said he was "disappointed" but wouldn't give up.  There's no suggestion Andreessen's comments represented anything other than his own, loosely tweeted thoughts. But these weren't the words of a random member of staff - he's on the board, and has influence.  "Facebook stands for helping to connect people and giving them voice to shape their own future," Zuckerberg wrote on Wednesday.  Do people trust him? After this week, perhaps fewer will.

What is less celebrated, but no less true, is his role as the father of Britain's nuclear bomb.  It was Attlee, as Labour's post-war prime minister, who made sure Britain got its own "nuclear deterrent", committing millions to its development at a time when the country was technically bankrupt.  He did it in secret, without a debate in Parliament or the Labour Party, partly out of a desire to avoid damaging rows.  The rows would come soon enough - and are continuing to split the party more than 70 years later, as Jeremy Corbyn wrestles with the seemingly impossible task of reconciling its pro and anti-nuclear factions.  Attlee had his reasons for wanting Britain to become a nuclear-armed nation. He had just been elected prime minister when America dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, in August 1945.  He realised in an instant that the air raid wardens and fire engines that had fought to limit the damage done by Nazi bombs, were now useless in the face of the awesome destructive power of this new weapon. The only way to protect the population, he reasoned, was to have the ability to fight back.  "The answer to an atomic bomb on London is an atomic bomb on another great city," he wrote in a secret memo to a cabinet committee 22 days after Hiroshima.  This is the concept of a nuclear deterrent and "mutually assured destruction" in embryo.  But Attlee was no warmonger. He wanted to rid the world of the menace of nuclear war by handing control of the weapons to the United Nations, even arguing that information about the bomb should be shared with the Soviet Union.  "He immediately recognised the potential importance of nuclear weapons both for the conduct of war and for the conduct of international relations," wrote Len Scott, former professor of international history at Aberystwyth University in an essay on Labour and the bomb.  But at the same time, added Prof Scott, he believed that Britain must have its own bomb, a need that became more pressing when the Americans passed a law, in August 1946, preventing it from sharing atomic secrets with other nations, including its closest wartime allies Britain and Canada, whose scientists had worked alongside the Americans to develop the Hiroshima bomb at Los Alamos.  Debate raged in cabinet committees between those, like Chancellor Hugh Dalton, who argued that Britain could not afford a bomb, or the new V-force aircraft needed to deliver it, and those who argued that the country needed to keep its place at the top table and avoid being humiliated by the Americans.  "We've got to have this thing over here, whatever it costs," foreign secretary, and former trade union leader, Ernest Bevin, is reported to have told one committee.  "We've got to have the bloody Union Jack on top of it."  A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement  Is there such a thing as a nuclear button?  How important is Trident to the UK's security and international standing?  Bevin's national prestige argument won the day - and it would surface again in 1957, when Attlee's successor as Labour leader, Hugh Gaitskell, hit back at growing calls from Labour MPs for Britain to get rid of it nuclear weapons by telling that year's party conference the unilateralists were gripped by an "an emotional spasm" that would send a future Labour foreign secretary "naked into the conference chamber".  Labour's leadership argued at the time that Britain should only abandon its weapons if it could persuade other countries, such as China and France, to do likewise (persuading the Soviet Union and the US to disarm was seen as a non-starter).  But the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) was at the height of its influence within the party, arguing on moral grounds against weapons of mass destruction, with the Hydrogen bomb, a vastly more powerful weapon, recently tested by Britain, looming over the debate.  CND's calls for Britain to unilaterally scrap its weapons briefly became party policy, before being overturned at the 1961 conference.  Gaitskell's successor Harold Wilson fought the 1964 general election questioning Britain's nuclear deterrent, declaring in Labour's manifesto that Polaris, American nuclear weapons to be fitted to British-built submarines under an agreement brokered by Tory PM Harold Macmillan, "will not be independent and it will not be British and it will not deter".  Attlee was even wheeled out, in a party election broadcast, to denounce the independent deterrent as a "nonsense".  But the manifesto did not include an explicit commitment to abandon Polaris, just reassess the deal with the Americans, and although Wilson reduced the number of submarines from five to four, and brokered a non-proliferation treaty, Polaris became operational in 1968, beginning the round-the-clock patrols that continue to this day.  The left felt betrayed by Wilson and when Labour unexpectedly went into opposition after the 1970 general election the party renewed its commitment to scrap Polaris and end moves towards a new generation of nuclear weapons, neither of which it did when it returned to power in 1974.  When Margaret Thatcher entered Downing Street in 1979, the nuclear issue erupted with renewed ferocity in the Labour Party, against a backdrop of escalating tensions between NATO and the Soviet Union.  It had now become a hugely symbolic issue for the party, a key dividing line between the left and right, who would eventually break away to form their own party, the SDP, to fight the 1983 general election.  Then Labour leader Michael Foot, a founder member of CND, was a unilateralist, who also vowed to remove US nuclear weapons from British soil. His successor Neil Kinnock, was also a unilateralist, although he would drop the policy after losing the 1987 election, arguing that the best way to achieve a nuclear-free world was through negotiation between nuclear-armed nations.  Kinnock had united the party behind scrapping nuclear weapons by arguing that the money spent on Trident - the replacement for Polaris - should go towards bolstering Britain's conventional forces instead, but he still faced accusations from the Conservatives that he was "soft" on defence and would make Britain a target for Soviet invasion.  There were also questions about how Labour could scrap its weapons on moral grounds yet still expect to shelter under America's "nuclear umbrella" and how it could remain a member of nuclear-armed NATO.  Tony Blair banished unilateralism from New Labour's vocabulary, along with other policies thought to be harming its credibility with centre ground voters.  But the nuclear issue still had the power to split the party - in 2006 he faced his biggest rebellion since the Iraq war over plans to push ahead with a replacement for Trident, when 88 Labour MPs voted against the government. The backing of the Conservatives ensured Blair won the vote convincingly.  His argument to MPs was that Trident was the "ultimate insurance" and that it would be "unwise and dangerous" for Britain to unilaterally give up its nuclear capability.  One of the rebels who spoke against Blair that night was veteran backbencher and CND stalwart Jeremy Corbyn, who quoted the mayor of Hiroshima in his speech, who had "pleaded" with Britain not to "develop a new generation of nuclear missiles".  "We face an important decision tonight," said the Islington North MP.  "Either we endorse this vast expenditure, or we encourage a public debate that I believe will come down on the side of sanity, sense and peace in the world, and we do not go ahead with this vast expenditure that can lead only to a more dangerous world."  The idea that Corbyn would one day succeed Blair as Labour leader, and re-open the party's debate about unilateral disarmament, would have seemed pretty far-fetched to the MPs in the Commons chamber that night, including Corbyn himself. But he has now has the chance he has long craved to persuade the public of the "sanity" of his case.  Labour has tended to be gripped by internal rows about scrapping nuclear weapons when it has been in opposition for some years, only to maintain the deterrent when it returns to power.  But, as the party's resurgent unilateralists point out, this is the first time Labour has seriously debated the issue in a post-Cold War context. It is a very different world to the one facing Attlee in 1945.  The challenge for Labour's defence review, headed by Emily Thornberry, is to avoid the Cold War thinking that still tends dominates both sides of the debate and see the issue with fresh eyes.  Given the party's tortured history, that will not be easy.	politics

The Public Administration Select Committee said the arrangement could end up as a "short term experiment" due to levels of opposition in the Commons.  Legislation deemed to affect England, or England and Wales only, is now subject to an extra stage of scrutiny, involving only MPs elected there.  Ministers said it was an "important balance" to devolution elsewhere.  The rules, introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland, were activated in the House of Commons for the first time last month.  English and Welsh MPs gave their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies, as part of a new stage in the legislative process for considering bills applying only to their constituents.  In a report on the new system, the cross-party committee of MPs said there was "strong English demand" for measures to address the "constitutional anomalies" that devolution had brought.  But it said the new provisions were "ad hoc", lacked transparency and appeared incompatible with the 40-year old Barnett Formula for distributing funds to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  "The new standing orders do require further consideration and evaluation if they are to be anything more than a short-term experiment in the House's internal procedure," the MPs said.  "That former clerks of the House of Commons - individuals steeped in decades of learning about Parliamentary procedure - should have difficulty in discerning what these standing orders mean should raise serious further doubts about how sustainable they are."  The report said the test for whether legislation applied only to England, which is determined by the Commons Speaker, was not "very simple" and risked putting the Speaker in an "unnecessarily controversial position".  The extent of the opposition to the system, which has united Labour, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Democratic Unionist Party, "underlined their vulnerability", the committee said.  The SNP has said the changes are "driving Scotland out of the door".  "With only the Conservative Party in favour of the new arrangements, these standing orders face a high risk of being overridden as soon as there is a non-Conservative majority in the House of Commons," it said.  "That the standing orders have attracted such hostility and can be removed on the basis of a simple majority must raise doubts as to whether they can ever be more than a temporary expedient, and currently they cannot be considered to be part of a stable constitutional settlement that will endure."  Tory MP Bernard Jenkin, who chairs the committee, said the new system had little cross-party support and urged ministers to come back with "more comprehensible proposals" during a review later this year.  A government spokesman said: "The government is committed to a stronger Union and a fair settlement for the whole of the United Kingdom, and English votes for English laws brings an important balance to the unprecedented powers that have been devolved to other parts of the country.  "We will be reviewing the operation of the standing orders later this year, drawing upon the work of both the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee and the House of Commons Procedure Committee."	politics

In future, the MP involved will be consulted and named only if there is an issue of "parliamentary privilege or constitutional significance" at stake.  The cross-party Procedure Committee said revealing names of arrested MPs was incompatible with a privacy right.  Chairman Charles Walker said he was not asking for special treatment for MPs but for the law to be applied equally.  The Commons approved changes to the existing rules, which require the police to notify the Speaker when an MP is arrested and for the Speaker in turn to tell the House, without a vote.  Mr Walker, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, in Hertfordshire, told the Commons that MPs should have the same rights to privacy as any other citizen, and in future their names should not be put in the public domain if they were arrested, unless this was directly connected to their role as an MP.  But Labour MP John Mann argued that it would give MPs special rights in law that do not apply to everyone else.  Deputy Commons leader Therese Coffey said it was up to the Commons to decide although the government has indicated that the change brings MPs into line with the rest of the public.  The Procedure Committee's recent report revealed that in the last Parliament, Tory MPs Nigel Evans and David Ruffley were named after their arrests. Mr Evans was later acquitted of sexual offences and Mr Ruffley cautioned for assault.  Green MP Caroline Lucas was arrested during an anti-fracking protest and later acquitted of obstruction.  Meanwhile it has emerged that police have been involved in a total of five cases linked to MPs' expenses under the current system, with none of the politicians identified.  In December it emerged that the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), the MPs' expenses watchdog, had referred three potentially criminal cases to police in March without any public announcement, or identifying the individuals involved.	politics

The codes could have been used to seek payouts had the scam not been detected.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said no personal taxpayer data had been compromised or disclosed by its systems.  It added it was monitoring use of its web application for any further signs of fraudulent activity.  The agency said the attackers had used personal data stolen from elsewhere to compromise its systems.  The information had then been processed by a software bot - meaning an automated program - to make one application after another for a Pin.  "Based on our review, we identified unauthorised attempts involving approximately 464,000 unique social security numbers, of which 101,000 SSNs were used to successfully access an e-file Pin," it said in a statement.  Affected taxpayers should receive a letter to alert them to the fact their social security number had been misused in this way, the IRS said.  Furthermore, it said, it had marked the affected accounts to protect them against any further attempt of tax-related fraud.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35539868	Twitter puts video ads and top tweets at start of timelines	Twitter is making two major changes to the way its users' timelines appear.  The app will show a selection of prioritised tweets, based on what it thinks users are "most likely to care about", ahead of the normal list of posts shown in reverse chronological order.  And a new First View feature will let marketers place a video ad high up in the feeds.  The announcements came ahead of the company's latest financial results.  They are designed to make users more engaged with the platform and appeal to advertisers.  But one expert said the extra prominence Twitter was giving to video ads might backfire.  "The reason why Facebook has been so successful of late is that it has been able to put sponsored posts and videos into people's feeds," commented Richard Holway, chairman of the TechMarketView consultancy.  "But Twitter is a different affair as people typically spend a much shorter time looking at each post, and putting intrusive videos at the top of their feeds, making it more cluttered, is going to upset a lot of people."  Unlike normal ads on the platform - which algorithms target at specific users - a First View video will be shown to everyone within a region or country who uses Twitter over a 24-hour period.  That makes it a potentially more effective way to build mass awareness of a product over a short period of time.  But another company watcher also expressed doubts about the idea based on the examples Twitter had posted online.  "The whole point of in-feed ads is that they should seamlessly roll through and not interrupt your experience," said Sarah Vizard, Marketing Week's news editor.  "Brands will love [First View] as it sits across the top of the page and everyone will see it, but for the users themselves, they will think: 'It takes over most of the feed. I came here to see what the people I follow are posting and to find information, and to get to that I now have to clear the ad.'"  Twitter is due to post its full year's earnings after the US markets close.  The loss-making firm's shares are trading about 69% lower than where they were a year ago, partly because of concerns that its number of users is not growing fast enough.  Last month the Recode news site reported that the service had cut the number of ads being shown to some of its most active users as part of an effort to keep them engaged.  More recently, the hashtag #RIPTwitter began trending on the service after Buzzfeed reported that the platform planned to change the order tweets were presented in.  The firm has since clarified that a toggle switch in its app's settings will allow the new function to be turned on and off.  If left selected, the "never miss important tweets" setting will affect up to the first 60 tweets shown at the top of a timeline.  If the user pulls to refresh the feed, it will return to its normal reverse-chronological ordered state.  Twitter said that users would see an on-screen prompt to alert them to the feature the first time they encountered it.  "No matter how much time you spend on Twitter, you probably feel like you've missed important tweets from accounts you follow," it said.  "We hear this from people every day. As a content consumer, the new Home timeline feature will help you catch up on tweets you don't want to miss from the people and topics you care about.  "As a content creator, it means your followers are more likely to see and engage with your best tweets. We've already noticed that people who have used this new feature tend to retweet and tweet more."  The firm's chief executive Jack Dorsey is expected to be quizzed about the expected impact of both the new changes during a conference call with analysts following its earnings announcement.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35540187	Flash banner ads banished by Google	Google is to banish most ads built in Adobe Flash from its advertising networks, the company has announced.  From 30 June, its AdWords and DoubleClick networks will no longer accept new "display ads" such as banners built in Flash.  From January 2017 it will stop displaying Flash ads on websites - but some video ads built with Flash will still be accepted.  Google said it wanted to "encourage" advertisers to switch to HTML5.  Today, immersive websites and streaming video can be delivered using HTML5 - an open-source coding language that works across all modern web browsers and devices.  Adobe Flash is a proprietary technology that can be added to web browsers to enable animations, interactivity and streaming video on websites.  It was first released in 1996, at a time when the web was largely static.  But the software has been plagued by security problems, and has been criticised for affecting computer performance and battery life.  Flash failed to make a successful transition to mobile devices, so websites that rely on it do not work as intended on smartphones and tablets.  Google's advertising networks AdWords and DoubleClick place promotional content on more than a million websites.  The company said: "We've rolled out tools to encourage advertisers to use HTML5, so you can reach the widest possible audience across screens."  In August, online shopping giant Amazon announced it would no longer accept Flash ads on its website.  The BBC is currently working to move its video streaming service iPlayer away from Flash too.  Adobe has developed its own HTML5 tools to help developers produce content that works across most modern devices.  But the company said it would support Flash as long as customer demand remained.  In November, it told the BBC: "Until alternative technologies accommodate all our customers' needs, for example in delivery of HD video content on the desktop, we will continue to support Flash."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35534463	Housing: Corbyn and Cameron clash over 'right-to-buy'	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused David Cameron of presiding over a "very damaging housing crisis," at Prime Minister's Questions.  Mr Corbyn said the PM had failed to replace homes sold off under "right-to-buy", which is being extended to housing association tenants in England.  He said the government's action on housing was "simply not good enough".  Mr Cameron hit back by saying he would "increase the housing supply in the social sector".  He said two new homes would be built for each one sold off by local authorities in London, where shortages are the most acute.  But Mr Corbyn said measures in the Housing Bill would result in the loss of 180,000 affordable homes while only one in every eight council homes sold under "right-to-buy" had been replaced with a social home.  He accused Mr Cameron of "overseeing a very damaging housing crisis, it's pricing out people from buying, it's not providing enough social housing, therefore many people are forced to rely on the private rented sector".  A committee of MPs earlier warned that the flagship Conservative policy of housing association tenants in England, the "right-to-buy" their homes, could reduce the stock of affordable housing.  Those taking advantage of it will get a discount, to be funded by the sale of "high value" council houses.  But the Commons communities and Local Government committee says this could leave councils short of cash to replace sold-off properties.  It predicts a "substantial surge" of demand to buy homes from the 1.3 million housing association tenants in England when the new scheme comes into effect, leading to the risk that the policy will "stall" for lack of funds.  It also raises concerns that a 1% rent cut for four years imposed on housing associations would threaten their ability to build new homes and provide other services to tenants.  The government says it wants to ensure "anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream".  But the Communities and Local Government committee says the funding model it is using, which will force councils to compensate housing associations with the money raised from council house sales, is "extremely questionable" and is effectively a "levy" on councils.  It says the scheme should be funded by central government and questions how ministers are going to meet their target of replacing every property sold off with a new one.  Potential buyers must have been tenants for at least three years, the same as with council tenants.  The government says that means up to 1.3 million housing association tenants will be eligible in England. Around 500,000 housing association tenants are already eligible for some discounts. So the new scheme will extend rights to a further 800,000 tenants, and increase the discounts available.  Committee chairman Clive Betts said: "The fundamental success of this policy depends not just on whether more tenants come to own their home but on whether more homes are built.  "The government needs to set out in more detail how it will meet its target of at least one-for-one replacement of the sold homes, particularly given issues such as the availability of land, the capacity of the building industry and the uncertainty of income from council home sales."  The scheme, which is partly designed to reverse the steady decline in home ownership levels in recent years, is currently being piloted in Norfolk, Oxfordshire, Surrey, Merseyside and a number of London boroughs.  It will be phased in across the rest of England in due course, although it is voluntary - housing associations are not being forced to adopt it. The government is updating interested tenants on its progress here.  Housing associations taking part in the scheme will be expected to sell properties to tenants interested in buying them at a discount of £103,900 in London and £77,900 elsewhere.  The government is committed to building 400,000 new affordable homes by 2020-21.  Under the the Housing Bill currently going through Parliament, local authorities make payments to government based on the value of their housing stock, on the expectation that more expensive properties would be disposed of when falling empty.  Ministers say that the sums raised from selling "high-value" council homes will pay not only for "right to buy" discounts, but also for the construction of cheaper social housing to replace them and a new £1bn Brownfield Regeneration Fund to support building on derelict land.  But the committee's report quotes estimates from the Chartered Institute of Housing which suggest that the sale of high-value homes will raise only £1.2bn - £2.2bn a year of the £4.5bn needed.  The committee warns that the amount raised from the sale of vacant council homes will vary across the country, depending on property prices.  It warned that a large number of properties sold through the existing right-to-buy scheme had quickly been put on the rental market and that it might be necessary to limit the ability of housing association tenants to become private sector landlords.  It also called for safeguards to protect the amount of affordable housing in rural areas, including allowing housing associations to offer tenants "portable discounts" to purchase an alternative property to the one they live in where it was difficult to replace.  The Department for Communities and Local Government said more details about the sale of vacant council houses would be set out in due course but the principle of using them to pay for new house building was the right one.  "There are billions of pounds locked up in local authority housing assets. It is only right that when they become vacant they are sold enabling the receipts to be reinvested in building new homes and supporting home ownership through right-to-buy," a spokesman said.  He added: "Anybody who works hard and aspires to own their own home should have the opportunity to realise their dream."  Labour housing spokesman John Healey said: "Government policies should be funded by government, not a cash-grab from councils forced to sell off their own housing to pay for right-to-buy discounts.  "Unless the legislation is changed, ministers will force cash-strapped councils to pay for their pet policy project."  The Labour government in Wales is planning to abolish right-to-buy entirely while in Scotland it will be phased out by August. A separate scheme exists in Northern Ireland.	politics

Jose Manuel Barroso said plans for an "emergency brake" on in-work benefits for migrants was a creative compromise but would not reduce immigration.  He said the EU would be "weaker" if the UK voted to leave in a referendum.  He spoke out as the six founding members of the EU recommitted to building an "ever closer union".  PM David Cameron wants EU leaders to agree to a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership this month and then hold a referendum on whether the UK stays in the EU.  Leaders will debate the proposals in Brussels on 18 and 19 February. Mr Cameron requires the approval of all 28 EU members for the package, which includes limiting in-work benefits for migrants for up to four years.  Speaking to BBC's Newsnight, Mr Barroso described the UK as "one of the most important shareholders in Europe".  But the former Portuguese prime minister said: "The way the British look at Europe is frankly different from the way France, or Germany do.  "It is not only Britain that cares about sovereignty, we all want the rights of our country respected," he added.  He was speaking as the foreign ministers of Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands resolved "to continue the process of creating an ever closer union".  But, reflecting the differing view in the UK, they acknowledged that not every country should have to agree.  Mr Cameron says his draft deal aimed at keeping Britain in the EU would deliver "substantial change".  The deal includes an "emergency brake" on in-work benefits paid to EU migrants and paves the way for the UK's referendum to take place as early as June.  However, when asked whether the proposed measures on in-work benefits would put anyone off from coming to the UK, Mr Barroso replied: "No, frankly not."  "People who want to go to Britain, if the basic rights of the people are ensured, they will be willing to go but of course with slightly different conditions," he said.  Mr Barroso, who stood down from the European Commission last year after 10 years as the EU executive's president, said: "Everyone wants Britain to remain."  Reacting to his interview, a spokesman for Vote Leave - which is campaigning for the UK to leave the EU - told the BBC: "Even the EU's biggest advocate knows the PM's renegotiation is trivial.  "The final package won't bring powers home, won't cut the cost of Brussels and won't fix the fundamental flaws at the heart of the European project."  The exchanges came as the Britain Stronger In Europe campaign unveiled 30 new cross-party recruits - ten each from the Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems.  And in other developments on Wednesday a report by Migration Watch said that 1.8 million illegal border crossings had been recorded by the EU border agency Frontex in 2015.  It says another three million migrants were expected over the next two years, adding that Greece and Italy "cannot possibly cope with such numbers", yet only 683 migrants have been returned.  Arron Banks, co-founder of Leave.EU, said: "This scandalous policy and security shambles demonstrates how the EU cannot control its borders and why it is heading for further catastrophe this summer."  On Tuesday papers released ahead of next week's crunch summit suggest any agreement on changes to the UK's membership of the EU would be "legally binding".  Draft conclusions of the summit, issued in advance, state any deal would be "fully compatible with EU treaties".  If Mr Cameron can secure agreement from the other 27 EU member countries, he is expected to proceed with an in-out referendum on the UK's membership by the end of June.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35532644	Parents urged to boycott VTech toys after hack	Cybersecurity experts have said parents should boycott or at least be cautious of VTech's electronic toys because of how it has handled a hack attack.  They gave the advice after it emerged that VTech's new terms and conditions state that parents must assume responsibility for future breaches.  More than 6.3 million children's accounts were affected by last year's breach, which gave the perpetrator access to photos and chat logs.  VTech says it stands by the new terms.  "Since learning about the hack of its databases, VTech has worked hard to enhance the security of its websites and services and to safeguard customer information," said a spokeswoman.  "But no company that operates online can provide a 100% guarantee that it won't be hacked.  "The Learning Lodge terms and conditions, like the T&Cs for many online sites and services, simply recognise that fact by limiting the company's liability for the acts of third parties such as hackers.  "Such limitations are commonplace on the web."  The new terms were flagged by a blog by the Australian security specialist Troy Hunt.  In it, he detailed additional flaws with VTech's products and alleged that it was misleading for the firm to have described the attack as being "sophisticated".  He also disclosed that the company had issued new terms and conditions on 24 December for the software that lets parents add apps to its devices and copy off photos and other saved files.  "You acknowledge and agree that you assume full responsibility for your use of the site and any software or firmware downloaded.  "You acknowledge and agree that any information you send or receive during your use of the site may not be secure and may be intercepted or later acquired by unauthorised parties.  "You acknowledge and agree that your use of the site and any software or firmware downloaded there from is at your own risk."  Another security researcher, Scott Helme, later confirmed the terms appeared when Europe-based owners of the VTech's InnoTab Max tablets updated its firmware.  "People don't even read these things!" he wrote.  "If [VTech] honestly feel they're not up to the task of protecting personal information, then perhaps put that on the box and allow consumers to consciously take their chances rather than implicitly opting into the 'zero accountability' clause."  His condemnation of the firm has since been echoed by four other security experts.  "This is an unbelievably arrogant and derogatory response considering their track record with data security," said Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners.  "If VTech think that those T&Cs are the answer to their problems I think they should be given a bigger problem to deal with. Boycott them and take your money somewhere else."  Prof Angela Sasse - director of the UK Research Institute in Science of Cyber Security - added that she would be "cautious" about all of the firm's products.  "The nature of the security flaws identified, and their displayed lack of urgency in fixing them, casts doubt on their security competence," she told the BBC.  "Instead, they change the T&Cs to 'dump' any risk on their customers - I would not trust a vendor who behaves in this way."  "The existence of vulnerabilities that result from beginners' mistakes in the VTech website is disappointing, as is their handling of the situation, so it raises serious questions about whether there are vulnerabilities in their other products," he said.  "It would be understandable that potential customers will look elsewhere."  Meanwhile, Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson said the firm's behaviour was "unforgivable, ignorant and indefensible".  "Would I advise consumers to avoid an organisation that attempts to take advantage of its customers' goodwill and to absolve itself of its legal responsibilities with weasel words? Unequivocally, yes."  "It's unusual to see these terms in consumer contracts and it's questionable if they would be enforceable," said Callum Murray, head of commercial technology at Kemp Little.  VTech's reach is about to grow following a deal to take over its US rival Leapfrog, which makes child-centric tablets computers, smartwatches and apps of its own.  But one company-watcher commented that the impact went even further.  "A lot of eyes are on VTech because nothing on this kind of scale has happened in the toy industry before," said Billy Langsworthy, editor of the Toy News trade magazine.  "Toy firms need to be aware that these kinds of cyber-attacks are going to become more common, so right from how they set up their security to how they deal with the PR of a breach is something that this sector is going to have to look at."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35531228	North Korea campaigners seek USB sticks	Two US human rights charities have launched an appeal for donations of old USB sticks, also known as flash drives.  About 10,000 USB sticks are smuggled into North Korea each year by groups of people who have defected from the Communist state.  They are loaded with Hollywood films, South Korean TV shows and other material such as the Korean language version of Wikipedia.  In North Korea it is illegal content, and delivering it is dangerous.  In addition, the groups usually have to bear the cost of buying the flash drives themselves.  They often also have to fund bribes for North Korean officials when smuggling them in, and sometimes they are stopped by the South Korea authorities, who say the illicit activity increases tension between the two nations.  "After food and water, the next thing people in North Korea want is knowledge," said Alex Gladstein, chief strategy officer of the non-profit Human Rights Foundation.  Most North Korean citizens have no access to the internet. Contact with the outside world is largely forbidden by the government, led by Kim Jong-Un.  "We really believe education is the solution in North Korea," Mr Gladstein told the BBC.  "For many of us flash drives are becoming an obsolete technology - we have the cloud, and we can share things. But every single flash drive could save someone's life."  The Human Rights Foundation and Forum 280 are working with organisations such as the North Korean Strategy Center (NKSC), in Seoul, which distributes the sticks.  "It's always been a challenge to get people to understand why North Koreans' access to information is important, and this gives us a physical representation," Sharon Stratton, from the NKSC, told Wired.  "It's literally a key that will unlock a new world for North Koreans."  About 200 sticks have been sent in by individuals since the campaign's launch last week, and one has pledged to buy 10,000 for the appeal.  Mr Gladstein said he hoped corporations would donate unused branded drives ordered in bulk for corporate events.  Defectors describe increased demand for material from the outside world - and the preferred format has shifted from DVD to USB.  "Arnold Schwarzenegger, Leonardo DiCaprio and Sylvestor Stallone are very popular," said Mr Gladstein.  US TV series Desperate Housewives and Spartacus and the Hunger Games films are also favourites.  Last year, Mr Gladstein was involved in a campaign that saw 10,000 copies of a 10-minute montage from The Interview airdropped into North Korea.  The film's fictional plot to kill Mr Kim outraged the government.  And the US believes North Korea was behind the subsequent hack of Sony Pictures, the studio behind the film.  North Korea has always denied the accusation.	tech

The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) - which sets rules and regulations on America's roads - shared its thoughts in a letter to Google made public this week.  Until now, any car without a human driver would not be considered roadworthy.  However, in light of technological advancements, the NHTSA has changed its perspective.  "If no human occupant of the vehicle can actually drive the vehicle, it is more reasonable to identify the driver as whatever (as opposed to whoever) is doing the driving," it said.  "In this instance, an item of motor vehicle equipment, the Self-Driving System, is actually driving the vehicle."  It means Google's self-driving pod, which has no typical in-car controls, is one crucial step closer to being allowed on public roads.  With the NHTSA's blessing, the car now fits the key criteria required to pass the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards test.  It's the latest regulatory boost for Google after the US government announced in January a $4bn plan to create nationwide regulations for self-driving cars.  Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx said the initiative would provide consistency between states.  It followed an announcement by the Californian Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that said cars absolutely did need a driver - a ruling Google described as "perplexing".

David Cameron hopes to get agreement for his proposed renegotiation at a meeting of EU leaders on 18 February, paving the way for a future referendum.  Draft conclusions of the summit, issued in advance, state any deal would be "fully compatible with EU treaties".  No more detail is given about the final agreement still being negotiated.  The two-day meeting is a crucial moment in the debate over the UK's future in the EU. Mr Cameron requires the approval of all 28 EU members for a draft package of reforms to the UK's membership outlined earlier this month.  If he secures it, he is expected to proceed with an in-out referendum on the UK's membership by the end of June.  However, a former president of the European Commission has cast doubts on the likely impact of plans to limit payments of in-works benefits to EU migrants, which Mr Cameron has claimed is one of his main negotiating achievements and will affect the numbers coming to the UK.  Jose Manuel Barroso told the BBC's Newsnight programme that a proposed four-year emergency brake on benefits was a "creative and intelligent compromise" that upheld the central principle of freedom of movement and could win the backing of all member states.  But asked whether it would put anyone off from coming to the UK, he replied: "No, frankly not", adding that levels of immigration would be dependent on future labour market conditions.  "People who want to go to Britain, if the basic rights of the people are ensured, they will be willing to go but of course with slightly different conditions," he said.  Guide: All you need to know about the referendum  EU renegotiation: Did Cameron get what he wanted?  Referendum timeline: What will happen when?  The view from Europe: What's in it for the others?  The BBC's Brussels correspondent Ben Wright said draft conclusions are always circulated to member states a couple of weeks before EU summits and usually leaked to the media.  Drafts, he pointed out, often change significantly before the final agreed text.  The documents issued by the European Council on Tuesday briefly restate the broad areas of negotiation set out last week - including proposed limits on the payments of migrants' benefits, new powers for national parliaments and safeguards for countries outside the eurozone.  They also state that if EU leaders endorse the agreement, the new arrangements would become effective on the date the UK government informed the Council it was staying in the EU, were that to be the outcome of the referendum.  Amid continuing speculation about the timing of the referendum, one Conservative Eurosceptic MP has urged Mr Cameron to "bring it on".  Speaking during a Commons debate on the issue, Sir Edward Leigh said those seeking a British exit from the EU know their arguments and are confident of winning.  "We say to the prime minister: 'bring it on'. No delay, don't look worried, bring it on and we can have a proper debate and we can win this."  No date has yet been announced for the referendum although Downing Street is reported to favour staging the poll on 23 June.  The SNP, Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein all object to this, saying it would be too close to elections in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on 7 May, while the first minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, has also called for it to be deferred until the autumn.  Former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond accused the prime minister of "gambling this country's entire European future on his sham negotiation and this shame of a campaign".  He described the lead up to the referendum as "thoroughly depressing", attacking Mr Cameron's suggestion that leaving the EU could lead to migrant camps like the "Jungle" in Calais being set up in the UK.  "The truth is, of course, it doesn't matter," he said. "It would take at least five years to withdraw from the European treaties. By then we could have 10 times the number of refugees or indeed, we could have none at all.  "No one knows how it would affect the bilateral arrangements between Britain and France. It is pointless, pathetic, puerile debate - typical of what looks like it is going to be, a depressing campaign - the political equivalent, I would suggest, of a no score draw."  Immigration Minister James Brokenshire said political figures in France indicated they would like to see an end to "juxtaposed" border controls in Calais, which allow UK officials to check passports on French soil.  He told the Commons Home Affairs committee: "That is certainly not our view. The French government have indicated that is not their view. But the situation could change. That sense of certainty is what the prime minister is pointing to and the impact if the juxtaposed controls were changed."	politics

Charles Walker said claims by Channel 4 News that some bills were not included in local spending returns during three 2014 by-elections and in Thanet South in May's election should be examined.  The Tories say all their spending was recorded in accordance with the law.  Channel 4 News said it had obtained hotel bills which suggest the party broke electoral rules in the Newark, Clacton and Rochester & Strood by-elections, the first of which the Conservatives won and the other two it lost to UKIP.  Campaign spending in by-elections is limited to £100,000 for each party.  But Channel 4 News says it has uncovered £56,866.75 of undeclared hotel bills in Rochester, which would have taken the party £53,659.83 over the £100,000 limit.  It found bills totalling £26,786.14 in Clacton, which would have taken the party £10,835.36 over the limit, and receipts totalling £10,459.30 in Newark, which would mean an overspend of £6,650.28.  Charles Walker, the Tory MP for Broxbourne, told Channel 4 News that the matter should be examined.  "I'm going to raise it at the board but I suspect others will be raising it at the board. These are serious allegations," he said.  "I'm not diminishing the nature of these allegations. But the Conservative Party believes it has complied with election law."  Labour's candidate in the 2014 Newark by-election, Michael Payne, has written to his local chief constable asking for an investigation.  "Channel 4 appear to be in possession of documents which raise questions relating to spending by the Conservative Party during the 2014 Newark by-election; the questions raised allegedly relate to spending that appears not to have been declared," he wrote.  "I am seeking assurance this evidence and matter will be investigated, and if necessary referred to the appropriate authorities in order to reassure the residents of Newark constituency that established electoral laws and procedures, which are designed to protect our democracy have been complied with."  Nottinghamshire Police are yet to respond to the letter.  UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who lost a fiercely contested battle with the Conservatives in Thanet South last year, has said the party will not make a formal complaint but he would support any complaints made by members of the public.  A spokesman for the Electoral Commission said it was aware of the allegations.  "Alleged breaches of the rules around candidate spending at by-elections or parliamentary general elections are matters for the police to investigate under the Representation of the People Act 1983," he said.  A Conservative spokeswoman said: "All by-election spending has been correctly recorded in accordance with the law."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35534469	Corbyn plotters told to 'stop sniping' by union boss	Unite leader Len McCluskey has accused a "cabal" of Labour MPs of plotting against their leader Jeremy Corbyn.  The union boss said some Labour MPs did not accept Mr Corbyn's mandate although their alternative vision for the country was "stale and uninspiring".  In a speech in Oxford, he urged malcontents to "stop the sniping" and to "take the fight" to the Tories.  Mr Corbyn has faced criticism of his leadership and stance on issues such as defence and counter-terrorism.  His handling of a shadow cabinet reshuffle last month, in which one prominent critic was sacked and opponents of the leader's position on Trident were sidelined, was widely criticised.  Earlier on Tuesday, a senior figure in the shadow cabinet said it might be impossible for the party to reach an agreed position on whether to renew the UK's nuclear weapons system.  But Mr McCluskey said it was time for those who have questioned the direction in which Mr Corbyn is taking the party to pipe down, saying the Labour leader deserved their loyalty.  "Their analysis of Labour's defeat in 2015 was unconvincing, their proposals stale, minimalist and uninspiring - and for the most part, they have still not shaped up after Corbyn's victory," he said. "Until they can do that, they are a plot without a programme; a cabal without a critique."  The "continual war of attrition" between different camps in the party was "achieving nothing beyond taking the pressure off the government", he said.  "So my clear message to the plotters is - stop the sniping, stop the scheming, get behind Jeremy Corbyn and start taking the fight to the Tories."  In his opposition to austerity and to foreign military interventions, Mr Corbyn was in tune with public opinion, Mr McCluskey said.  The Labour leader, he said, offered a "radical challenge to the status quo and business-as-usual politics", likening the insurgency which propelled him to victory in September's leadership contest to US Democratic politician Bernie Sanders' current bid for the White House.  "What Jeremy Corbyn offers - like Bernie Sanders in the US - is a calling out of corporate corruption, a rejection of the austerity that has made the UK the most unequal economy in the G8 and the promise that politics and politicians can and will put things right for ordinary working people."  And he criticised those who, he claimed, were suggesting May's elections in Scotland, Wales, and across England were a referendum on the Labour leadership.  "I am not a supporter of... changes designed to intimidate or undermine Labour MPs. But I also believe that we need to issue a clear warning to those who are advocating the parliamentary Labour Party being used as a lever to force Jeremy Corbyn out."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35528108	Trident: Getting agreed Labour position 'may be impossible'	Shadow home secretary Andy Burnham says it may be "impossible" for Labour to reach an agreed position on Trident.  Mr Burnham, who backs renewal of the UK's nuclear weapons, said a review by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry would be "very difficult".  Jeremy Corbyn backs unilateral nuclear disarmament and Scottish Labour has already adopted such a policy.  But Ms Thornberry has been accused of living in "la la land" amid claims the leadership might "fix" the outcome.  The shadow defence secretary received a hostile reception when she discussed the review at a meeting of Labour MPs on Monday evening. Ex-shadow defence minister Kevan Jones said Ms Thornberry had taken questions "but didn't answer any", adding that she had been "waffly and incoherent".  Some MPs told reporters outside the room that she had said Trident could soon be as obsolete as the Spitfire fighter aircraft was after the Second World War.  Ms Thornberry said she had been trying to explain that Trident may be overtaken by technology such as underwater drones, which were being developed to track submarines.  "The idea of the Trident replacement is that it can hide in the sea. If technology is moving faster than that then it may well be that Trident may not be able to hide.  "And if that's right, and if we are to bet everything on 'mutually assured destruction', we have to be assured that it will work - and if it cannot hide any more then that is a problem."  She told BBC Radio 4's Today on Tuesday that "four, five or six people kicked-off" at Monday evening's meeting of Labour MPs but they did not necessarily represent the whole Parliamentary party.  She said she had wanted to challenge those who had said "it has to be Trident" or nothing.  Asked why she did not just admit that she was against nuclear weapons, she said it was important to discuss all options.  "We need to have all the options on the table and we need to have a proper debate within the party," she told Today.  Labour peer Admiral Lord West, a former home office minister, telephoned into the Today programme during Ms Thornberry's interview to say that her argument about underwater drones was "nonsense".  She said the Chinese, Americans and Russians would not be spending billions on research if there was nothing in it.  Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.  The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.  The submarines carry up to 8 Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads.  Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear weapons system  Mr Burnham had earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We always knew this was going to be a difficult debate for the party - there are two positions here that are difficult to reconcile, maybe impossible to reconcile, and the party's got to find some way of accommodating those positions and move forward and not let this issue take over everything."  Defence analyst Paul Ingram, from the British American Security Information Council, said the advent of new technology meant it may no longer be possible for submarines to go undetected in 20 years.  This was a "particular problem" for the UK, he told BBC Radio 4's World at One, because it was the only nation that was "entirely dependent" on submarines for its nuclear capability.  Jeremy Corbyn is a longstanding opponent of nuclear weapons but some MPs and peers have threatened to resign if Labour reverses its decades-long support for British missiles. Others are understood to be thinking of making clear their personal support for Trident renewal to voters at the next election, if the party puts disarmament in its manifesto.  Ms Thornberry's review is due to be published in the summer but MPs could be asked to vote on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet before that.  Renewing the Trident fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade, is estimated by the government to cost £31bn, although opponents claim the final bill will be far higher than that.  Union leaders have warned that scrapping Trident could devastate communities reliant on the defence industry. But Scottish Labour will argue against renewing Trident in May's Holyrood elections having agreed its position last autumn.  Kezia Dugdale, Scottish Labour leader, told the BBC there had been a "healthy debate" in the party in Scotland and it now had an "honest position".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35531721	Internet monitoring bill 'must do more to protect privacy'	Plans to authorise mass data collection and hacking by Britain's spies do not do enough to protect privacy, a watchdog has warned.  The extent of the intelligence agencies' computer and internet spying operation has recently become clear.  The draft Investigatory Powers Bill is meant to put it on a firm legal footing.  But the Intelligence and Security Committee says the bill lacks clarity and is a "missed opportunity".  "Given the background to the draft Bill and the public concern over the allegations made by Edward Snowden in 2013, it is surprising that the protection of people's privacy - which is enshrined in other legislation - does not feature more prominently," says the committee's report.  "One might have expected an overarching statement at the forefront of the legislation, or to find universal privacy protections applied consistently throughout the draft Bill.  "However, instead, the reader has to search and analyse each investigatory power individually to understand the privacy protections which may apply.  "This results in a lack of clarity which undermines the importance of the safeguards associated with these powers."  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, said: "We have therefore recommended that the new legislation contains an entirely new part dedicated to overarching privacy protections, which should form the backbone of the draft legislation around which the exceptional powers are then built. This will ensure that privacy is an integral part of the legislation rather than an add-on."  Mr Grieve added: "The draft bill appears to have suffered from a lack of sufficient time and preparation."  The Home Office is due to publish a final, amended version of the bill later this year.  The draft bill, which is one of the longest pieces of legislation to be considered by MPs in recent years, would force internet service providers to store web browsing records of everyone in the UK for a year.  This is meant to help the police and security services keep pace with technology being used by terrorists and organised criminals.  But security chiefs told the ISC, a cross-party committee of MPs and peers, that they already "have a range of other capabilities which enable them to obtain equivalent data" so this part of the bill will mainly be used by the police.  The ISC wants to restrict the scope of proposed "equipment interference" warrants, allowing spies to hack into suspects' smartphones and computers and download data from them. either within the UK or abroad.  Given that the "targeted" warrants could cover "a target as broad as an entire hostile foreign intelligence service" it is not clear why "bulk" warrants are also included in the bill, the committee says.  The committee is also concerned about the downloading of large databases, which might include medical or bank records, known as bulk personal data sets, to aid investigations.  Dominic Grieve said: "Given that each Bulk Personal Dataset potentially contains personal information about a large number of individuals - the majority of whom will not be of any interest to the agencies - the committee considers that each dataset is sufficiently intrusive that it should require a specific warrant.  "We therefore recommend that Class Bulk Personal Dataset warrants are removed from the legislation."  The draft bill allows the security services to hold - but not use - bulk personal data sets for a temporary period without a warrant in certain circumstances.  This could happen, the report says, when the data has been acquired "opportunistically," without the time to apply for a warrant, but it means the agencies could hold the data without authorisation indefinitely which was clearly "not appropriate".  The committee is also calling for more clarity about the privacy safeguards to be applied to the examination of material gathered by the trawling of internet traffic passing through the UK, a practice revealed by US whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The draft bill is being scrutinised by a joint parliamentary committee which is due to report on Thursday.  The ISC, which took evidence in private from Home Secretary Theresa May and the heads of MI5, MI6 and GCHQ, has confined its scrutiny to the parts of the bill that relate to secret intelligence material, which other committees cannot see.  Sir Francis Richards, a former head of GCHQ, said said the agencies already had most of the powers they needed but the bill was needed to increase transparency and public confidence in a "post-Snowden" world.  "The old legislation was designed to be obscure because there was not supposed to be any public understanding of the agencies' techniques," he told BBC Radio 4's the World at One.  There was now a need to "put the record straight" but the draft bill, in his view, struck the right balance between security and privacy.  The ISC report was welcomed by civil liberties campaigners.  Jim Killock, of the Open Rights Group, said: "Rushing through legislation has to stop. It's time for a proper debate about whether bulk surveillance powers are acceptable in a democracy like the UK."	politics

Last year, it made changes to the way the site is viewed in Belgium following a similar order from the Belgian Privacy Commissioner.  The French data protection body also demanded stronger password complexity, requiring at least eight characters rather than the existing six.  Facebook said privacy was its priority.  "Protecting the privacy of the people who use Facebook is at the heart of everything we do. We... look forward to engaging with the CNIL [French data protection authority - Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes] to respond to their concerns," a spokeswoman said.  The social network tracks everyone who visits the site, regardless of whether they are members, by installing cookies - small text files which gather information about web activity.  The type used by Facebook, known as datr, can last for two years.  In Belgium, visitors to the site must now log on before they can view any pages.  The CNIL also told the firm to cease the transfer of some personal data to the US, as the Safe Harbour agreement has ended.  The agreement, which enabled the transfer of data between the EU and US, was ruled invalid in October 2015, and while a new pact has been drawn up, it is not yet operational.  If Facebook fails to comply with the French privacy body within the three-month time frame it may face a fine, Reuters reported.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35526160	Whitehall urged to tighten hospitality rules for officials	Government departments have been urged to be "more stringent" over accepting corporate hospitality and gifts.  A National Audit Office review found officials were justified in accepting most offers but some were questionable in terms of relevance and frequency.  Tickets to sporting events, bottles of champagne and iPads accepted by senior officials may not have been consistent with official guidelines, it said.  The Cabinet Office said the clear principles in place were working well.  Under the guidelines, officials are only supposed to attend functions and accept gifts when they are in the interests of government, and the offer is proportionate without presenting any conflict of interest.  The spending watchdog examined how rules on acceptance and disclosure of corporate hospitality had worked across Whitehall between 2012 and 2015, focusing in particular on three departments: the Department for Business (BIS), HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Defence, Equipment and Support (DE&S) arm of the Ministry of Defence.  It found that senior officials accepted gifts and hospitality on 3,413 occasions over the period, from nearly 1,500 different organisations. The Department for Business accounted for the most (718), while the Department for International Development (20) had the fewest instances.  While lunches and dinners accounted for more than 60% of hospitality, only 40 gifts were reported over the period.  In 2014-2015, the 200 most senior officials in Whitehall accepted an estimated £29,000 in overall hospitality, with BIS officials accounting for the most, an estimated £7,170. Over the same period, it is estimated that BIS officials as a whole accepted £35,000 worth of hospitality and gifts, compared with £100,000 at DE&S and £19,000 at HMRC.  The watchdog said most of these were routine sandwich lunches, dinners and drinks receptions which were "reasonable" for officials to attend and in line with government business.  But it said there were exceptions, with officials accepting tickets to football matches, including the FA Cup semi-final, tennis games at Wimbledon, movie premieres and pop concerts. In some cases, officials were also accompanied by their spouses or their children.  Gifts accepted that were deemed to be disproportionate, in terms of their value, included a hamper from Fortnum and Mason, a £300 painting and a £300 Mont Blanc pen, although the latter was surrendered to officials.  Some officials at DE&S were also deemed to have overstepped the mark in terms of the frequency with which they accepted hospitality from defence companies such as BAE Systems and Airbus Group.  Although there was no evidence of hospitality or gifts causing a conflict of interest, the watchdog said meetings with firms such as Deloitte or PwC, that provide services to government, risked a perception of conflict.  It also questioned the decision of officials to accept hospitality from the British Bankers Association when some of its members were subject to regulatory and criminal investigations.  "Public officials are sometimes offered gifts and hospitality by external stakeholders which it is reasonable for them to accept," said Amyas Morse, the NAO's director general. "This can however, undermine value for money or affect government's reputation.  "While most, but not all cases, declared by officials appear on the face of it to be justifiable in the normal course of business, we found some weakness in the oversight and control of gifts and hospitality. This needs to be addressed by the Cabinet Office and departments."  Details of hospitality and gifts accepted by senior civil servants were first made public in 2009. Departments are required to publish registers four times a year. Twelve out of 17 departments managed to meet this quarterly target between 2012 and 2015, the watchdog said.  The Cabinet Office, which drew up the official guidelines, welcomed the report, saying it "showed that the system is working well, with offers of hospitality being recorded and properly acted upon".  "Clear and well understood principles governing the acceptance of gifts and hospitality are in place for all civil servants," a spokeswoman said.  "This government is the most transparent ever and publishes an unprecedented range of information about gifts and hospitality received by ministers, special advisers and senior civil servants."	politics

A hacker, or hacking group, published via Twitter what they said were records of 9,000 DHS employees.  According to technology news site Motherboard, the hacker has said he will soon share the personal information of 20,000 DoJ employees, including staff at the FBI.  The news site said it had verified small portions of the breach, but also noted that some of the details listed appeared to be incorrect or possibly outdated.  In a statement, the DHS told journalists: "We take these reports very seriously, however there is no indication at this time that there is any breach of sensitive or personally identifiable information."  The Department of Justice also downplayed the breach's significance.  The hacker is understood to have used simple human engineering to bypass one stage of the authorities' security systems.  Motherboard quoted the hacker, who explained: "So I called up, told them I was new and I didn't understand how to get past [the portal].  "They asked if I had a token code, I said no, they said that's fine - just use our one."

He also denied the delay in making the decision had anything to do with May's London mayoral election - where the anti-Heathrow expansion Zac Goldsmith is standing for the Conservatives.  Mr McLoughlin insisted the delay was based on environmental concerns.  Last year, the Davies Commission, looking at how to increase airport capacity in the south east of England, recommended the building of a third runway at Heathrow rather than a second one at Gatwick.  But Conservative MP for Richmond Park and North Kensington, and candidate for London Mayor, Zac Goldsmith has long pledged to resign as an MP and force a by-election if the Conservatives decided to go ahead with the airport's enlargement.  Asked by Transport Committee chair, Louise Ellman whether the delay in making a decision on where to build a new runway had anything to do with the mayoral election in May, Mr McLoughlin said: "We knew when the mayoral election was going to be when we said we hoped to take a decision, when we hoped to take a decision.  "So I think to somehow now say the only reason we're not taking a decision is because of the mayoral election is not really credible. But I know that's what some people want to interpret on that."  The transport secretary said it was in fact Sir Howard Davies' own evidence to the Environmental Audit Committee late last year that caused the government to postpone its decision on where to build the runway.  Mr McLoughlin said Sir Howard's evidence to the Committee on environmental impact was "an issue" and did cause the government "to pause".  He added that the mayoral election and potential referendum on the UK's membership of the EU could impact on the timing of any announcement on airport expansion but that he "very much hoped" the decision would be made before the Summer recess at the end of July.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35520820	Should Twitter ignore its users?	For the last 48 hours Twitter has been… well, all of a Twitter.  An article in Buzzfeed suggesting that the social network was about to introduce what is known as an algorithmic timeline - promoting tweets deemed most relevant rather than publishing them in reverse chronological order - sparked a wave of what can only be described as furious panic.  Under the hashtag #RIPTwitter, thousands, perhaps millions, told the world that this was the end of civilisation as we know it, that a beautiful thing was being crushed, that the company, whose share price has been tumbling for months, was signing its own death warrant.  Finally, the CEO Jack Dorsey was forced to react. "Hello Twitter!" he called out. "Regarding #RIPTwitter: I want you all to know we're always listening. We never planned to reorder timelines next week."  He went on "Twitter is live. Twitter is real-time. Twitter is about who & what you follow. And Twitter is here to stay! By becoming more Twitter-y."  But was Dorsey right to blink in the face of pressure? And should he be "always listening" to his users? That depends on whether you believe the hoariest old cliche of management books: "The customer is always right."  I certainly sympathise with those who say that Twitter isn't broken, so it does not need the kind of radical fixing implied by an algorithmic timeline. For me, it works just fine, connecting me to like-minded communities of dog-owners, sourdough loaf bakers, and gadget enthusiasts, while providing the best breaking news service on the planet.  Like many other heavy users of Twitter, I have been sniffy about recent innovations such as "Moments" and would rather things carried on just as they are. But perhaps Mr Dorsey and his management team should not be listening to people like me - we're almost certainly going nowhere. He has to cock an ear to the concerns of three other constituencies - investors, advertisers and the people who use Twitter infrequently or not at all.  Because the crisis in his company is not about revenues, which are growing nicely, and it's not about what loyal users think - it is about growth. The last set of results showed Twitter user numbers had barely moved over the previous three months, up just four million.  Investors who bought into the business when it floated on the hope that it would grow at the same rate as Facebook, shuddered at that news and will be watching nervously when the next set of results is published on Wednesday. Advertisers are asking why they should spend money with a network when it is not delivering the kind of audience available elsewhere. So Twitter's top team is trying all kinds of tricks to make the experience of joining and using the network more intuitive.  And there's another reason why Jack Dorsey might be tempted to ignore those users protesting about a change that has not even happened yet. If he looks at the history of Facebook, he will see that just about every innovation introduced by Mark Zuckerberg has met with dismay from existing users. Here's how Techcrunch reported the arrival of something called Newsfeed in 2006:  "There has been an overwhelmingly negative public response to Facebook's launch of two new products yesterday. The products, called News Feed and Mini Feed, allow users to get a quick view of what their friends are up to, including relationship changes, groups joined, pictures uploaded, etc., in a streaming news format."  Petitions were signed, boycotts organised, but quite soon the News Feed was seen as core to the Facebook experience, and then when it was tweaked there were again protests - from people who thought it was just perfect as it was. By the way, Zuckerberg's reaction to the Newsfeed protests was to say: "Breathe. We hear you…" and then carry on with his original plan.  So the customer is not always right, and if you listen too closely to your existing users, you will end up preserving your site in aspic. That would be fine by me - I like Twitter in its current form. But maybe Jack Dorsey should ignore me...	tech

Subsidised rents for households earning more than £30,000, or £40,000 in London, will be scrapped in April 2017.  Social housing tenants will be asked to pay rent at or near market rates.  Ministers say it "better reflects people's ability to pay" - but Labour and the Local Government Association say it would hit hard-working families.  The department for communities and local government argues that is "not fair that hard-working people are subsidising the lifestyles of those on higher than average incomes, to the tune of £3,500 per year".  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said people who could afford to pay more in rent "should do so" - but it would be graded, so that those on lower incomes would not have to pay full market rates.  "We have always said we would consider carefully how much more people pay as they move through the pay scales, once they get over £30,000," he told BBC Radio 5 live's Pienaar's Politics.  He said the government would "listen to what comes in before we make a final decision in the period ahead of us".  According to the LGA-commissioned study, almost 60,000 households in England will not be able to afford to pay rents at the market rate or take advantage of the right to buy.  Councillor Peter Box, housing spokesman at the LGA, which represents hundreds of local councils in England, said: "Many social housing tenants across the country will be unable to afford market rents or take up the offer to buy their council home under this policy.  "A couple with three children, earning £15,000 each a year, cannot be defined as high income. Pay to stay needs to be voluntary for councils - as it will be for housing associations.  "This flexibility is essential to allow us to protect social housing tenants and avoid the unintended consequence of hard-working families being penalised, people being disincentivised to work and earn more and key workers, such as nurses, teachers or social workers, having to move out of their local area."  The LGA figures, compiled by the estate agent Savills, show that almost 215,000 social housing tenants will be affected by the "pay to stay" policy.  The policy is expected to save £245m a year by 2019-20, ending a situation where higher-income social tenants benefit from taxpayer-funded subsidies of up to £3,500 per year.  Former head of the civil service, Lord Kerslake, now a crossbench peer, will attempt to amend the housing bill, which is being scrutinised next week in the House of Lords, to place the scheme at the discretion of local authorities.  The peer, who is now chairman of the Peabody Trust housing association, has warned that the proposals were part of a package that could "threaten the future of social housing".  He told The Observer: "When this was originally discussed in the coalition government, it was intended to deal with the very small number of high earners on over £60,000.  "The current proposals will affect a lot more households with earnings of half that."  Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey said: "This new research backs Labour's concerns that this Tory 'tenant tax' could force thousands of working families from their homes.  "As the Housing and Planning Bill is debated in the House of Lords over the coming weeks, ministers should take a hard look at the effect their plans will have and use this opportunity to think again."

Treasury Select Committee MPs raised concerns that banks fined millions for wrongdoing may be exploiting loopholes and "unclear" rules to pay less tax.  It is important taxpayers do not "bear the burden", committee chairman Andrew Tyrie told the chancellor in a letter.  The Treasury said it would respond to the letter in due course.  Under UK law, banks are not allowed to log fines they are forced to pay for mis-selling and other misconduct as a cost in order to reduce their profits and, in turn, the amount of tax they pay.  There are also tight restrictions about off setting compensation payments to customers against tax.  However, Mr Tyrie said it appeared in some circumstances banks were able to claim fines they paid to the regulator were tax deductable.  He called on Mr Osborne to confirm this was not allowed, as there appeared to be "some doubt" about the rules.  In the early 1990s some firms had been deducting from their tax bill - i.e. treating as a legitimate expense - protection money paid to the Provisional IRA. The then Prime Minister John Major intervened and banned the practice. But there still remains no clarity on the issues of what can and cannot be deducted.  HMRC has issued guidance on the matter but, as you can see, the section under fines imposed by regulators still says (words to the effect of) on the one hand you can but on the other you cannot.  Even for tax experts, the question of whether mis-selling or fines imposed by the government or independent watchdogs can be considered a legitimate cost of business is unclear.  The Chartered Institute of Taxation has called for clarity from the government, which is exactly what the Treasury Select Committee also hopes to get in its letter to the chancellor today.  Mr Tyrie said it was "not just appropriate, but essential" that fines were not tax deductable.  "It is important that taxpayers are not required to to bear any part of the burden of any payment import by the FCA or overseas regulators. The bill should be picked up by the bank's shoulders."  If banks were "not happy about it", they had a number of possible remedies, including controlling employees salaries and bonuses, he said.  He also raised concerns that settlements reached with foreign governments were sometimes structured in a way that allowed payment to be offset against British tax.  He did not know whether this suggestion was well-founded, but if it was true it would be "alarming", he said.  In recent years, banks including HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and Clydesdale Bank have been fined by the FCA over misconduct.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35515408	EU referendum: PM accused of 'disrespect' to activists	Dozens of Tory members have accused David Cameron of showing disrespect to the party's grassroots after he told MPs to disregard their views on Europe.  In a letter to the Sunday Telegraph, the signatories from more than 40 Conservative associations said their opinions should be heard.  They said it was "deeply regrettable" that the PM had dismissed their views.  Downing Street told the newspaper that the prime minister had the "greatest of respect for Conservative associations".  "He was simply making the point that everyone should ultimately vote with their conscience," a spokesman said.  An in-out referendum on EU membership has been promised by the end of 2017, although it is widely expected to be at the end of June, if Mr Cameron can secure agreement to his reform proposals at the next summit of EU leaders on 18 February.  The PM said last week that MPs should not vote based on what their constituency association might say, and instead vote with their heart.  However, the associations' letter said: "It was through the dedication and hard work of Conservative Party members that David Cameron secured the majority he needed to form a government...  "It is deeply regrettable that the prime minister dismisses the very people who helped secure his victory, and he should remember that no prime minister has a divine right to rule."  In the letter they urged Mr Cameron to "accept that loyal Conservative Party members want the opportunity for a balanced debate".  Among the signatories are Ed Costelloe, chairman of Grassroots Conservatives, Matt Ewert of the South Staffordshire Conservative Association, Tony Partridge of the Clwyd South Conservative Association and Geoffrey Vero of the Surrey Heath Conservative Constituency Association.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said local Tory associations "care passionately about their local ability to make decisions" but the PM had stressed everyone would have their say at the referendum.  The letter comes amid continued speculation about whether a big cabinet name will lead the campaign to take Britain out of the EU when Mr Cameron announces the date of the referendum.  Home Secretary Theresa May is thought to have ruled herself out, and Mr Cameron is hoping to persuade London Mayor Boris Johnson to back him.  A spokesman for Justice Secretary Michael Gove said he "supports the prime minister's strategy to renegotiate our relationship with the European Union" and it would be "premature" to make a judgement before the deal is concluded.  A source close to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said he would "make his views known when he's seen the final deal".  A spokesman for Employment Minister Priti Patel, who has been at the centre of press speculation that she will lead the exit campaign, said she had "always said she would make a judgement once we've seen the final deal".  UKIP MP Douglas Carswell told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme it "would be wonderful" to have a Eurosceptic cabinet minister fronting the exit campaign but it needs and welcomes anyone who wants to join it.  He refused to enter into the war of words between the rival groups vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign, but ruled out a merger between them saying there were fundamental differences on tactics.  The UKIP MP said Leave.EU, which is backed by UKIP donor Arron Banks, wanted to focus on "identity and immigration," while Vote Leave, which he supports, wants to put forward an "optimistic, upbeat internationalist message".  A third group, Grassroots Out, which was founded by two Conservative MPs and is backed by UKIP leader Nigel Farage and Mr Banks, has said it is exploring whether it has enough cross-party support to make a bid to be the official Leave campaign.  Lib Dem Leader Tim Farron, who wants Britain to remain in the EU, said both the leave campaigners and the prime minister were failing to concentrate on the "big questions" that people would be thinking about when they voted in the referendum.	politics

From May, charities and organisations will no longer be allowed to spend taxpayers' money on lobbying ministers.  The Cabinet Office said the new clause in grants would mean funds go to good causes, not political campaigns.  Sir Stuart Etherington, chief executive of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, said it was an "insane policy" that would not work in reality.  "Take a service charity funded to run a helpline. They may well be dealing with ex-servicemen, there will be policy issues that emerge from that. They're not allowed to tell the government?" he told the BBC.  "The other reason is, if you've got mixed funding, how are you going to know which is the government's and somebody else's?"  The "draconian" move was "tantamount to making charities take a vow of silence", he added.  Under the new conditions , which only apply to grants from central UK government departments, organisations will not be able to use grants for "activity intended to influence - or attempt to influence - Parliament, government or political parties".  However charities will still be able to use privately-raised funds to campaign as they like.  Christopher Snowden, from the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), a right-of-centre think tank, agrees with the changes.  "It's not about silencing charities, it's not about stopping charities - whether they get public money or not - from speaking out, of course they should do, it's very important that they campaign and lobby for the things that are important to them," he told the BBC.  "It's specifically about the money that they get from government and how that is spent."  Cabinet Office Minister Matthew Hancock said: "Taxpayers' money must be spent on improving people's lives and spreading opportunities, not wasted on the farce of government lobbying government.  "These common sense rules will protect freedom of speech - but taxpayers won't be made to foot the bill for political campaigning and political lobbying.  However, Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who chairs the Commons Health Select Committee, posted on Twitter: "Ending charities ability to lobby ministers wld have serious consequences for #publichealth Balance already distorted in favour of industry."  According to a House of Commons briefing, the estimated total income of the UK voluntary sector (not including charities) in 2012-13 was £40bn, of which £13bn came from government grants.  The Cabinet Office said UK government departments gave the voluntary sector just under £10bn in grants last year.  BBC political reporter Alan Soady said exactly how the new rules would be enforced - and how charities would prove which pots of money funding for lobbying came from - was still unanswered.  There was also some concern in Whitehall that some charities seemed to have been set up primarily to lobby, or that they were straying from their brief on the issues they lobbied on, he said.  The move follows research by the IEA into so-called "sock puppets", where taxpayers' money is given to pressure groups which then campaign for policy changes or extra money.  Former Bishop of Oxford Lord Harries, who chairs a commission which has looked into charity lobbying - the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement - said the "polarisation" between charities' direct work and policies they wanted to change was "very, very unhelpful".  Charities on the "front line" could often best identify where government policy was failing, and "surely they are morally bound to tell the government they could improve their work to help, say, children in poverty?" he said.  The system has been trialled in grants provided by the Department for Communities and Local Government.  Ministers insisted it had not curtailed the ability of charities such as Shelter from lobbying on housing legislation.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35508740	Jeremy Corbyn: 'Councils should run local services'	Councils should be able to run utilities in their areas as part of moves to "roll back the tide" of privatisation, Jeremy Corbyn has said.  Privatisation of services has made them less accountable, the Labour leader told a conference in Nottingham.  He said English councils should have similar powers to cities on the continent, where local authorities have control of water and energy services.  A Conservative spokesman said such a move would "hurt working people".  Mr Corbyn's support for public ownership and anti-austerity message are at the centre of Labour's campaign for May's local elections in England.  He told the Association of Labour Councillors conference he wants councils to become "public entrepreneurs" with greater freedom to spend taxpayers' money and to borrow to fund investment and public services.  Mr Corbyn, who has already set out plans to take the railways back into public ownership, said he would back local authorities to take control of utilities and other services in their area.  "Privatisation isn't just about who runs a service, it's about who services are accountable to," he said.  "It's about who shares the rewards, about protecting the workforce and getting a good deal for local people who use the services.  "After a generation of forced privatisation and outsourcing of public services, the evidence has built up that handing services over to private companies routinely delivers poorer quality, higher cost, worse terms and conditions for the workforce, less transparency and less say for the public.  "We will give councils greater freedoms to roll back the tide of forced privatisation.  "It locks people out of decision-making, makes services less accountable, too often means a bad deal for taxpayers, a bad deal for communities and a bad deal for those that work in the services too."  A Conservative spokesman said: "This is another example of how the Labour Party will hurt working people by racking up more debt and increasing taxes to pay for it - driving up the cost of living for working families.  "That's why Labour are a threat to our economic security and every working family's security. The Conservatives will continue to deliver stability, security and opportunity for working people."  Mr Corbyn also said that remaining in the European Union was in the best interests of the British people.  However, he said he wants to see further reforms in Brussels, including stronger workers' rights and an end to the pressure to privatise public services.  The speech comes as it emerged a Muslim women's group has written to Mr Corbyn claiming women have been stopped from becoming councillors by Muslim men in the party.  Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into "systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors".  Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35474095	Could John McDonnell ever be Labour leader?	I don't keep much political ephemera. An Obama fridge magnet (designed to look like a paper bag of groceries - "Put food back on your table, vote Obama 2008"); a sardine can suggesting what tube travel would be like if Ken Livingstone was elected mayor; and a copy of the original New Labour pledge card (a smiling Tony Blair, teeth not yet perfect).  And a small pin badge - a few years old, a bit rusty around the edges. On it, the photograph of a smartly dressed middle aged man, slightly greying at the temples, the trace of a smile playing on his lips. "John 4 leader", it says.  I don't know how old it is. It could be nine years, could be six, because the John is John McDonnell who twice intended to run for the leadership of the Labour Party. The badge might also be quite rare, because on neither occasion - when Tony Blair stepped down in 2007 and then when Gordon Brown resigned in 2010 - was he able to follow through. Not enough of his fellow MPs declared they'd be willing to nominate him.  Yet today, six months into the job of shadow chancellor, he's become one of the most influential figures in the Labour Party.  He's struck "absolutely the right note" over Google's tax agreement with HMRC, a former senior minister in the Labour government told me. Praise indeed, because for this veteran of the party's internal battles of the 1980s, Mr McDonnell's elevation is worrying because of his "rigidity".  Having dealt with Mr McDonnell in the late 1990s, when Tony Blair was Prime Minister, he says the shadow chancellor is "obsessed with positions adopted a long time ago" and "didn't want to listen, didn't want to change".  Tony Blair argued that Labour needed to change itself if it was ever to be allowed to change Britain. To Mr McDonnell and others on the party's left, that became an excuse to abandon too many of Labour's past positions.  As the BBC's London political correspondent in the late 1990s, I vividly remember one of his attempts to get the Blair government to maintain one of those past positions. It was a relatively minor issue - voting arrangements in the City of London.  The local authority for the square mile, the Corporation of London (which has since been renamed the City of London Corporation), is the only one in the whole UK where businesses have votes in elections, whether or not those who run them live within the Corporation's boundaries.  The government agreed a compromise with the Corporation: in return for removing inconsistencies that favoured old City businesses at the expense of new ones, the City could keep the business vote, a decision which was in defiance of Labour's long-established policy. To New Labour this was pragmatism, a continuation of the "prawn cocktail offensive" under John Smith's leadership, to reassure a group traditionally sceptical about Labour.  To John McDonnell it was a betrayal of the basic political principle of one person one vote. For months he waged guerrilla war in the parliamentary trenches, sometimes alone, challenging clauses, forcing votes.  Why, then, was it Jeremy Corbyn, not John McDonnell, who stood for leader? Comrade Corbyn, the biography by Rosa Prince, which has just been published, offers an insight into this. To an extent, it was Buggins' turn. Mr McDonnell had tried and failed to get on the ballot paper twice before, while Diane Abbott had run in 2010.  I think, though, some of it has to do with their contrasting characters. Unlike Mr McDonnell's previous bids, Jeremy Corbyn was able to reach the number of nominations, albeit at the last moment, because MPs like Dame Margaret Beckett nominated him even though they'd never dream of voting for him.  Put simply, despite being a serial rebel over three decades, he's likeable. As that ex-Labour minister put it to me, he's "easy to deal with". Even a former Conservative cabinet minister speaks with approval of the manner in which the Labour leader once challenged senior Iranian officials in a private meeting over abuse of human rights in their country.  Mr Corbyn will be 70 years old at the time of the next election, older by a few months than Michael Foot when he fought the 1983 general election.  Were he to decide to retire before then, John McDonnell would be an obvious choice for Corbynites who want to change Labour. In 2007 his abortive leadership pitch included leading "a real Labour government based upon the policies our supporters expect from us".  For a would-be Labour leader, his biography ticks a lot of boxes:  Yet that intransigence and what's been called a lack of warmth makes me wonder whether, even if he makes a success of being shadow chancellor, he could improve much on the small number of parliamentary colleagues who were willing to nominate him for leader before.  I was once told by a supporter of Denis Healey that the reason he never became leader of the Labour Party was his stubborn refusal to woo his fellow MPs. Principled of course, but even he later admitted he wished he had.  So I'll put the "John 4 leader" badge back in a drawer, but remember where it is - just in case.	politics

Muslim Women's Network UK demanded an inquiry into "systematic misogyny displayed by significant numbers of Muslim male local councillors".  "They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered," it told BBC Newsnight.  Labour said it had the best record of any of the parties in selecting female and ethnic minority candidates.  As Mr Corbyn prepared to speak to the Association of Labour Councillors on Saturday, BBC Newsnight spoke to about a dozen Muslim women up and down the country.  They appeared to point to a pattern of obstruction from within Labour Muslim ranks and back up Muslim Women's Network UK complaints of sabotage.  Optician Fozia Parveen claims her efforts to become a Labour councillor in Birmingham in 2008 were scuppered by men within the party.  She said: "At the time, I was aware of a smear campaign against me, they said that I was having an affair with one of the existing councillors.  "I was quite taken aback. People were turning up at my family home trying to intimidate my mum."  Ms Parveen said Muslim men told her mother to stop her from pursuing becoming a councillor.  She added: "It would be members of the local Labour Party. I didn't see them myself but my mum did say it was them."  Shazia Bashir was the first choice for Labour in a seat in Peterborough in 2007.  She claims that when her father said he would not support her, Muslim men from within the local Labour Party made her step aside. They deny the claim.  "Because I didn't have my father's consent and support, I had to step down. I was pressured into stepping down," said Ms Bashir, who was 31 and married with two children at the time.  Jean Khote, a sitting Labour councillor in Leicester, said good women candidates were barred by the membership in some areas with high Muslim populations - and that was kept from people higher up the party.  She said they would say there were not adequate candidates among the women, which she said was not true.  "There were brilliant women on the panel. I've met them and had discussions with them, they were brilliant," she added.  Newsnight was told similar stories by other women who wished to remain anonymous.  One said: "They spread this slander about me... It's the way they get to you."  Another said she was told by Labour members "Islam and feminism aren't compatible".  An advocate for gay rights was told: "This is un-Islamic. Leave that for white people."  And many spoke of being criticized for being too Westernized.  Shaista Gohir, from Muslim Women's Network UK, told Newsnight the tight-knit patriarchal communities operate a system of clan politics known as "braderi", in which votes are delivered in blocks.  "These men have a cultural mindset, which they've brought from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh," she said.  "They operate a braderi male kinship system and they've brought the system here, what I call an old boys network.  "They don't like women to be heard, to be empowered, because we will then challenge the status quo, challenge misogyny."  Muslim Women's Network UK has also written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling on him to launch an inquiry into the political participation of ethnic minority women.  But Ms Gohir said: "From our experience, Muslim women are most affected by Labour Muslim male councillors due to the latter's number in certain towns and cities."  Labour said its selection procedures included strong, positive action such as all-women shortlists and rules to ensure women were selected in winnable council seats.  "We have the best record of any party in selecting women and BAME [Black, Asian and minority ethnic] candidates and we will continue to do all that we can to make sure candidates are representative of the communities they seek to represent," it said.  "The Labour Party has a fair, democratic and robust procedure for selecting council candidates. Local Labour Party members select their local candidates within the party's rules and guidelines.  "Those wishing to become Labour councillors are interviewed by an independent assessment team and unsuccessful candidates have a right of appeal to the regional party board."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35507558	Ministers to look at further curbs on public sector pay-offs	The government is to look at more curbs on public sector redundancy payments as Chancellor George Osborne pledged to "rein in" sums paid to managers.  A consultation will look at the case for limiting payoffs to three weeks salary per year of service and reducing the amount people are entitled to when they near retirement.  The move follows a campaign by the Daily Mail against "fat cat pay-offs".  Ministers have already pledged to cap individual payoffs at £95,000.  The government says it wants to significantly reduce the cost to the taxpayer of public sector redundancy payments, which totalled about £6.5bn between 2011-12 and 2013-14.  Freedom of Information requests by the Daily Mail and the Taxpayers' Alliance revealed that around 3,500 council employees across the UK earned more than £100,000 while one chief executive had an annual salary of almost £500,000.  In new guidance, the government repeated that any public servant earning just over £140,000 - which is the amount the prime minister is paid - must have their salary authorised by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury.  But ministers also plan to press ahead with plans in the Conservative manifesto to cap redundancy payments at £95,000 and ban them when senior staff leave one public sector employer only to join another shortly afterwards.  In a new consultation that will last three months, the government will look at the case for setting a standard formula for calculating what exit payments public sector mangers are entitled to, according to weeks worked or money earned over a certain period.  Ministers also want to find out if there is support for preventing public sector employers offering their staff private health insurance and to taper the amount that executives can receive when they are approaching retirement.  The Treasury said it wanted to the make exit compensation "fairer, more modern and more consistent".  Mr Osborne told the Mail; "Taxpayers foot the bill for the public sector and we've been determined that we take further action. We'll rein in unfair exit payments and issue new guidance across the public sector on the highest salaries."  The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said that as the squeeze on public sector budgets continues, ministers hope this plan can simultaneously save money and be popular.  The £95,000 cap will apply, among other bodies, to the NHS, the police force, local authorities and schools.  When the consultation was launched in August, the government said that the BBC, Channel 4, Bank of England, the Armed Forces, Royal Bank of Scotland and other taxpayer-owned banks would be among organisations exempt but ministers said they would expect such bodies to introduce "their own, commensurate cap on exit payments".  Local authorities argue that retaining valued staff in senior roles doesn't come cheap.  One council said it offered some employees private health cover "to minimise absence from work due to sickness".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35501298	EU referendum: Row erupts between exit campaigns	A row has erupted between rival groups campaigning for Britain's exit from the European Union.  Vote Leave and Leave.EU are vying to be designated as the official Leave campaign when David Cameron calls a referendum.  Merger attempts appear to have been scuppered by personality clashes and differences over tactics.  Labour MP Kate Hoey has quit Vote Leave but will continue to co-chair the Labour Leave campaign.  A Labour Leave spokesman told the BBC it has now ended its affiliation to Vote Leave, an umbrella group which includes business leaders, Tory MPs and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell among others.  But Labour Leave's founder John Mills, who remains Vote Leave deputy chairman, said in a tweet that it was still affiliated to the campaign and would continue to work with all leave campaigners.  The latest bout of infighting was sparked by an internal letter leaked to The Times, by Mr Mills, a Labour donor, warning about "damaging bickering" at the top of Vote Leave.  In his letter, Mr Mills says feuding in the group had prompted the Labour MP's departure.  Ms Hoey is now supporting a third group, Grassroots Out, founded by two Conservative MPs and backed by Leave.EU, and is due to appear at a rally in Manchester later alongside UKIP leader Nigel Farage.  In his letter Mr Mills also criticises Dominic Cummings, a former special adviser to Michael Gove, who was the campaign's director, until a shake-up this week saw him moved to a non-executive role, accusing him of generating "ill-feeling".  Responding to Mr Mills' letter, a Vote Leave spokesperson said: "Vote Leave is a genuinely cross-party campaign and we value our Labour Party MPs and supporters across the country."  In a separate development. Green Party London Assembly member Dame Jenny Jones tweeted "will vote to leave #EU but cant work with an organisation with so little judgement as to put Lawson at its head," a reference to the appointment of Tory peer and climate change sceptic Lord Lawson as Vote Leave chairman.  The Electoral Commission has the task of designating the official leave and remain campaigns, which will get access to £600,000 in public funds, TV broadcasts, free mailshots and a spending limit of £7m.  The two main Leave groups differ on tactics and both are claiming to command more cross-party support - a crucial factor in getting the designation.  Arron Banks, the UKIP donor who is bankrolling Leave.EU, has written to MPs to hit back at claims by Vote Leave that it is too focused on immigration, saying it is also stressing the positive benefits of quitting the 28 nation bloc.  He also attacks Dominic Cummings and Matthew Elliott, who ran the successful campaign against changing Britain's voting system in 2011's AV referendum, who also left Vote Leave's board this week for a non-executive role.  "I wouldn't put them in charge of the local sweet shop," Mr Banks says of the pair.  A Vote Leave spokesman said: "We've seen the letter and we wish him (Banks) well."  One of the founders of the Grassroots Out, or GO, campaign told BBC News the leave side of the debate "can't continue with all this bickering, there needs to be a coming together at some stage".  Conservative MP Tom Pursglove said: "It can't carry on as we are. We need to focus on winning the referendum."  He refused to say whether or not his group would be trying to win the official designation, but added: "If we're in a position where we can bring people together at the top then that's something we will look at. We've shown we can do that at grassroots."  Speaking on his regular LBC radio phone-in, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said he had tried to get the two campaigns to merge, but claims Vote Leave, which he describes as a "Tory front", "refuse to work with anybody".  In a message to all UKIP members and supporters, Mr Farage said the party was now officially behind Grassroots Out.  "With the unanimous support of our MEPs we now commit to supporting Grassroots Out and want our branches and members to join with GO as a means of working with activists from other parties and none."  He added: "So let us organise and mobilise our people's army around the GO banner for this referendum."  The row has been seized on by the pro-EU group Britain Stronger in Europe, which claims the out campaign has "descended into an all-out farce".

The problem is known as "error 53" and has appeared in Apple products before.  The Guardian reports that users' phones were disabled after the Touch ID home button was repaired by a non-Apple engineer.  The issue appears to arise once devices have been updated to the latest operating system, iOS 9.  In its report, the Guardian cites the experiences of a freelance photographer, Antonio Olmos, who says the problem occurred on his phone after he upgraded its software.  "When Olmos, who says he has spent thousands of pounds on Apple products over the years, took it to an Apple store in London, staff told him there was nothing they could do, and that his phone was now junk," the paper notes.  Many iPhone 6 customers have been discussing error 53 online.  At Apple's discussion forums, one user named wallihall wrote: "With this update I'm unable to use the phone, and still have to pay for the phone itself.  "I did get the front screen replaced, and I understand that it's now considered "tampered with", but at least let me use my iPhone on the old IOS system... I can't retrieve old photos or important documents I once had."  Apple told the paper that iPhone software checks whether any repairs were authorised by Apple.  A spokeswoman said: "When an iPhone is serviced by an unauthorised repair provider, faulty screens or other invalid components that affect the touch ID sensor could cause the check to fail if the pairing cannot be validated.  "With a subsequent update or restore, additional security checks result in an 'error 53' being displayed."  Apple has advised users facing the problem to contact Apple support.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35505196	Week ahead	There won't be many weeks between now and the likely date of the EU Referendum (23 June), when someone doesn't contrive to have some kind of Commons debate on some aspect of the EU.  Next week it's the DUP's turn. They're picking up the complaint made by the three first ministers, that that a referendum campaign culminating in a vote on that date, will impinge on the elections to the devolved parliaments.  Next on the Richter scale of political angst will be the annual debate on funding for local councils and police authorities in England - which will doubtless feature predictions of a collapse in key services. And after that there's an eclectic cocktail of railways, floods, rogue landlords and circus animals....  Meanwhile watch out for the election for the chair of the Environmental Audit Select Committee, where four Labour MPs are vying for the post vacated by Huw Irranca-Davies: Mary Creagh, Geraint Davies, Chris Evans and Barry Gardiner.  Over in the Lords, it's a rare week without the prospect of a government defeat, or indeed a vote of any kind...but fear not. Peers are merely gathering their powers for running battles over the detail of the Trade Union Bill and the Housing and Planning Bill, a bit later on.  One thing you won't find on this week's Lords agenda is the Scotland Bill, which has had its final day of committee stage debate kicked back beyond the half term, to allow time for more negotiation over the "fiscal framework" for devolution; this is the deal over the money the Scottish government will have to spend - it's not a part of the bill, but it is pretty hard to understand the implication s of the bill without it.  The framework is essentially an intergovernmental treaty between London and Edinburgh, and will set out how funding will be allocated between the nations of the UK. For example, will Scotland end up with a smaller share of the cake if the population of England increases faster?  Given the framework, the expectation is that the bill would be rushed into report stage, without waiting the normal couple of weeks - and be signed into law in good time for the Scottish Parliament elections in May.  The Commons opens (2.30pm) with Communities and Local Government questions - and, as ever, the end of question time (3.30pm) is the likely moment for taking any ministerial statements or urgent questions.  The main business is the vote on the annual up-rating of Social Security Benefits and the State Pension - which is both very big, and completely routine.  After that MPs move on to a backbench debate on the future of the routes of the Great Western Railway - the Conservative Kevin Foster will lead a debate looking at the need for electrification and resilience measures, as well as other improvements on the rail services covering the South West and South Wales.  The day's adjournment debate is on flood insurance for businesses - Calder Valley MP Craig Whittaker will be raising the plight of businesses hit by floods in 2012, which were then unable to afford the flood element of their insurance. Having been flooded again this winter, several have now folded. Mr Whittaker will press for some pool insurance system to be set up to provide protection for them.  In the Lords (2.30pm), peers put the final touches to the Education and Adoption Bill - with the normally pretty perfunctory third reading debate, and then move on to the first of four scheduled days of detailed committee stage consideration of the Trade Union Bill.  They are supposed to deal with the clauses on ballot thresholds for industrial action, e-balloting and other balloting methods, information requirements relating to industrial action, the timing and duration of industrial action, and the impact of the bill on devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.  There had been some talk that we could be into the kind of delaying tactics not seen in the Lords since the early days of the Coalition, when Labour fought the Parliamentary Voting and Constituencies Bill to a standstill.  But, while there are an awful lot of amendments down, I'm told the Opposition is not now likely to force any amendments to a vote; having pushed through the establishment of a special select committee to consider the party funding aspects of the bill, they are content to let the debates play out as normal, and wait for the committee to report before making their moves.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Health questions, followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem education spokesman John Pugh, which would give schools a right to challenge critical judgements by the standards watchdog, Ofsted. He will argue that the consequences of critical report from Ofsted are so serious for schools and their staff that there has got to be some redress and appeal against an unfair, clumsily managed or politically skewed report.  And he wants appeals against Ofsted judgements to be heard by independent regional panels with nominees from the professional associations. Appeals could not only be about the content of inspection but also about the procedure and timing of inspections where that may give an unrepresentative picture of school performance.  They day's main debates are on motions from two of the smaller opposition parties, first the DUP, then the Lib Dems.  The DUP motion is pretty sharp-edged. It:  "regrets that the government appears set to rush to a referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union in June 2016; believes that no case has been made for doing so, and that further, any such needlessly premature date risks contaminating the result; believes that a subject as fundamental as EU membership should be decisively settled after a full and comprehensive debate; notes the recommendations of the Electoral Commission as to best practice for referendums; further notes that there are elections happening in Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales, London and some local authorities in May 2016 and that the First Ministers of each of the devolved administrations have all expressed opposition to a June referendum date; and resolves that the Government should set the date for the Referendum having respect to the May elections as distinct electoral choices."  This will provide a chance for MPs to vote on the complaint - made repeatedly this week - that a 23 June referendum would mean the EU question overshadowed the elections for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh National Assembly and Northern Ireland Assembly. So expect the issue to be pushed to a vote.  The Liberal Democrats are being cagey about the content of their debate - when their Leader Tim Farron will speak on housing. The text of their motion will not surface until Monday.  The day ends with an adjournment debate on jobs and growth in the Humber Energy Estuary led by the Conservative, Martin Vickers. He will be asking for a progress report on the off-shore renewables sector.  In Westminster Hall, the day's debates range across: closer working between the emergency services (9.30am -11am); multi-sports clubs and HMRC changes to community amateur sports club status (11am-11.30am); work capability assessments (2.30pm -4pm); communications infrastructure and flooding in the North West (4pm- 4.30pm) and the social mobility index (4.30pm- 5.30pm).  In the Lords (2.30pm) peers have the third reading of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill - where the remaining issue outstanding is the Guardian's Allowance. It's not expected to be forced to a vote.  Then they launch into committee stage scrutiny of the Housing and Planning Bill - with the first of an expected seven days of debate. On the first day the House is supposed to debate the clauses dealing with rogue landlords and property agents in England; Banning Orders; the database of rogue landlords and property agents; rent payment orders and recovering abandoned premises in England. This is another highly contentious measure where Opposition peers will be pushing for changes, and there are already an impressive number down for debate.  The Commons warms up (11.30am) with Scottish questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time  Then Conservative MP Will Quince has a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Wild Animals in Circuses (Prohibition) - this picks up a cause which led to a spectacular backbench debate in the last Parliament, where the government backed off from whipping opposition against a ban - and MPs voted through a motion calling for one. But nothing happened.  MPs will then go through what has become an increasingly touchy annual ritual; the motions to approve the Police Grant and Local Government Finance reports for England. Expect a chorus of appeals for more money for particular localities - with the new element of rising concern about the finances of the police.  MPs will also be asked to approve new rules on the notification of Parliament of arrest of members. By ancient tradition, the arrest of an MP for any reason is noted in the business documents sent out to MPs every sitting day; this dates back to the time when such arrests were a tactic used by the Crown against the Commons.  After a number of recent cases the Commons Procedure Committee is seeking to change the rules so that arrests are only reported where they could be interpreted as an interference with Parliament.  In Westminster Hall the debates cover contracts let by the Home Office for asylum support (9.30am -11am); migration into the EU (2.30pm - 4pm); mobile infrastructure project (4pm - 4.30pm) and the UK government's policy on refugees (4.30pm-5.30pm).  But the 11am-11.30am Westminster Hall debate is one for the parliamentary nerds; it's on the implementation of the recommendations of the Digital Democracy Commission. This was an initiative by the Speaker, which reported in January 2015.  One of the Commission members, Meg Hillier, the Labour MP who now chairs the Public Accounts Committee, wants to keep up the pressure for electronic voting to be used in the Commons.  She would still like the voting to take place in the lobbies on either side of the chamber, arguing that the crush of all MPs there provides an invaluable opportunity for backbenchers to grab a quick word with ministers. But she would like a system that generates a result more rapidly and accurately. And she will be pressing the Leader of the House to launch a pilot scheme in this Parliament.  In the Lords (3pm) it's day two of the Trade Union Bill committee stage, where peers should be onto the sections dealing with picketing and the application of funds for political objects (clauses 9-11) - keep an eye on their progress.  And during the dinner break, there will be a short debate on the action being taken to promote cycling as a safe means of transport lead by the former Transport Secretary, Lord Young of Cookham, the artist formerly known as Sir George Young, aka: the bicycling baronet.  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Energy and Climate Change questions, which will be followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, setting out what MPs will be considering when they return from their half-term break.  The day's main debates, chosen by the Backbench Business Committee, are on justice for Equitable Life policy-holders, where the motion notes that most people who lost out from the scandal have not been fully compensated, as recommended by the Parliamentary Ombudsman.  Next comes a debate on conservation of sea bass and the effect of related EU measures on the UK fishing industry - the Conservative MP Scott Mann believes that the latest regulations forbids anglers from catching sea bass with fishing lines, while still allowing them to be netted commercially.  And the day ends with an adjournment debate on the police handling of the Poppi Worthington case, the 13-months-old child who died in December 2012, led by the local MP, John Woodcock. He will be pressing for immediate official release of the leaked IPCC report, which criticises the now-acting chief constable and calling for an independent inquiry  In Westminster Hall (at 1.30pm) there's a Backbench Business Committee debate on the persecution of Ahmadiyya Muslims and other religious minorities in Pakistan, led by Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. She is concerned about the rising hate speech in Pakistan against religious minorities, leading to a spate of murders and blasphemy prosecutions.  In the Lords (from 11am), the day's main legislating is on the second reading of the Armed Forces Bill. This is partly a constitutional measure, renewing the parliamentary approval required for the Army, Navy and Air Force to exist.  But it also includes measures to modernise and strengthen the service justice system, including powers for post-accident testing for alcohol and drugs, and a requirement for serious offences to be referred for prosecution rather than dealt with by a Commanding Officer, plus issues on battlefield legal immunity and human rights, and reservists. Will the question of war-crime allegations against British troops surface?  The final business is a motion to approve the Recall of MPs Act 2015 (Recall Petition) Regulations 2015 - the detailed workings of the new system that will allow voters to throw out errant MPs in certain very limited circumstances. There's a regret motion down from Labour's Baroness Hayter, but given that this is the last business on the last day before the Parliamentary half-term, it would be surprising if it was forced to a vote.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35497533	Theresa May feared creating police commissioner 'monster'	Home Secretary Theresa May has admitted fearing she had created a "monster" by setting up police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.  She said a number of incidents had given PCCs a "bad name", including criticism by Surrey's Kevin Hurley of his former chief constable Lynne Owens.  But she also revealed she was planning to extend the powers of PCCs after their elections in May.  This could include them setting up free schools for "troubled children".  PCCs, who replaced the previous model of police authorities, have powers to hire and fire chief constables and set police strategy and budgets.  They were first elected in November 2012 on a historically low turnout, and the next set of elections takes place in May.  At a Policy Exchange event in London, Mrs May acknowledged some of the problems involving PCCs had made her wonder if she had done the right thing by establishing the system as a replacement for police authorities.  She said: "In 2012, you could be forgiven for thinking that we were creating a monster. And I'd be lying if I said there weren't times over the last three and a half years when I thought we might have done just that."  She highlighted incidents including the former South Yorkshire PCC Shaun Wright's initial refusal to resign following damning revelations of child sexual abuse in Rotherham; the appointment of a youth commissioner in Kent with no background checks, only for her to have to stand down after it was revealed she had posted offensive tweets as a teenager; and the dispute involving Mr Hurley.  The BBC recently learned Mr Hurley had strongly criticised his chief constable Lynne Owens before her appointment as the new National Crime Agency head.  "These episodes have been disappointing and there's no doubt that some of them have brought the office of the PCC into disrepute," said Mrs May.  Labour has said it would abolish PCCs and put the savings into front-line policing.  But Mrs May proposed an expansion of their role. She said the government had not yet decided the "full extent" of its proposed changes but said there were "significant" opportunities for reform.  "The next set of PCCs should bring together the two great reforms of the last Parliament - police reform and school reform - to work with and possibly set up alternative-provision free schools to support troubled children and prevent them from falling into a life of crime," she said.  The home secretary suggested mergers between PCCs and directly elected mayors, saying there was a "fantastic opportunity" for policing and other services to be brought together "under a single directly elected mayor".  PCCs could also have a role in youth justice, probation and court services, she said.  This suggestion was welcomed by the Institute for Public Policy Research, which said it "makes sense" to give locally elected leaders control over the services.  The think tank's Jonathan Clifton said: "This will enable them to join up with other local services and tackle the things that lead to offending - such as lack of qualifications, mental health problems and homelessness."	politics

The company observed problems last week, after noticing some GPS time signals were 13 microseconds out.  Such a discrepancy is considered severe and several Chronos telecoms clients faced "12 hours" of system errors.  Previously, the GPS errors had also been blamed for disturbances with BBC radio broadcasts.  According to the US Air Force (USAF), which manages the GPS satellite network, problems began when a satellite named SVN 23 was decommissioned.  A USAF spokeswoman confirmed that the error had been pushed to the satellites by "ground system software".  "Our support manager was rung at [02:00]," said Chronos chief executive Prof Charles Curry.  "He was called from his bed by a network operations centre."  "What we saw was about 12 hours of problems," he told the BBC.  Prof Curry said telecoms companies relied on the accuracy of time measurements to control the flow of data through their networks.  The bits and bytes of a telephone call, for example, might be synchronised based on the time as reported by GPS satellite signals.  That signal was constantly monitored for accuracy.  And when the 13 microsecond error had been detected, it resulted in thousands of system warnings being activated at some companies.  "The alarms were escalating," said Prof Curry.  "One particular network we have, which is a global network, [was] seeing alarms from all over the place, all over the world."  Prof Curry said he was not aware of any consequences of these problems that would have been apparent to the public - probably thanks to back-up time systems.  And this kind of issue was extremely rare.  "Last week was an example of something going wrong in a fairly major way," he said.  "I don't think it's gone quite that badly wrong since 1 January 2004, when the same satellite vehicle number [SVN], 23, decided to become unhappy."  The Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation (RNTFnd) - which advocates the development of dependable timing systems - also had "minor reports" from the telecoms and energy sectors as a result of the GPS issue.  Dana Goward, the foundation's president, said, "It [had] a very broad and - very fortunately - minor impact on many infrastructure sectors."  During the decommissioning of SVN 23, an issue in the "Global Positioning System ground software" had been detected, the USAF said.  In a subsequent statement, the USAF explained that one signal from the satellites had been impacted.  However, GPS core navigation messages and clock were not affected, the statement said, and added that the issue had been fixed.  "While the software issue is still resident in the ground system, 2nd Space Operations Squadron has implemented procedures to ensure it does not reoccur," the USAF added.  This week, Schriever Air Force Base in Colorado published a press release unrelated to the incident, praising the "perfect signal" provided by GPS and pointing out how useful GPS was for military operations.  Lt Col Matthew Brandt said: "Somebody somewhere is using that signal to put a bomb on a target and kill a bad guy.  "Somebody is using GPS to pull an extraction or using it to call in an air strike."  In its original statement, the Air Force noted, "the Joint Space Operations Centre at Vandenberg [Air Force Base] has not received any reports of issues with GPS-aided munitions."	tech

The F-35's ejector seat "failed to meet neck-injury criteria" and the jet had a "limited ability to respond to threats", the US defence department has said.  The jet's development, by Lockheed Martin, has already cost $1 trillion (£0.7tn), partly funded by the UK.  Previously, its UK planned deployment date was put back from 2012 to 2023.  "It's one of the most delayed and problematic fighter programmes in history," said Justin Bronk, a military analyst at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI).  "If this sort of news keeps coming out in terms of continued problems with the testing... it's potentially embarrassing," he told the BBC.  Mr Bronk said that while the aircraft could be deployed in its current state, pilots would not be able to fly with as much freedom as planned because of the many technical limitations.  But he added: "They will make this thing work because they have no choice, there's no alternative.  "They will chuck whatever money they need to at it."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35491834	Auction site eBay 'fixes' bug but only partially	EBay says it has partially fixed a vulnerability on its online auction site that could have allowed hackers to trick users into downloading malware.  In December, a security company told eBay it had found a flaw in its active content, which allows store owners to offer users pop-ups and other content.  But, Check Point said, on 16 January eBay had replied it "had no plans to fix the vulnerability".  Now, eBay has told the BBC it has "implemented various security filters based on" Check Point's findings.  "While not fully patched, given that we allow active content on our marketplace, it's important to understand that malicious content on our marketplace is extraordinarily uncommon, which we estimate to be less than two listings per million that use active content on the eBay marketplace," it said.  EBay added it took security "very seriously" but "we have not found any fraudulent activity stemming from this incident."  The vulnerability meant any attacker could set up a store and insert the malicious code.  Check Point research manager Oded Vanunu said: "This vulnerability allows attackers to bypass eBay's code validation and control the vulnerable code remotely to execute malicious Java script on targeted eBay users.  "If this flaw is left unpatched, eBay's customers will continue to be exposed to potential phishing attacks and data theft."  Large corporations are increasingly being warned about vulnerabilities on their websites.  Last week, the BBC reported a bug spotted by security researcher Paul Moore in the Asda website had remained live for two years.  Following the report, the retailer acted to fix the issue.  "Sadly many firms turn a blind eye to security problems on their websites until the media get a whiff that something bad is going on," said security expert Graham Cluley.  "I don't think it is necessarily the case that websites are more bug-ridden than ever before, but rather that more and more vulnerability researchers are hunting for flaws on popular websites, and knowledge regarding bad practices and sloppy security is growing in the tech community," he added.	tech

MP Sir Keir Starmer will spend three months talking to communities, businesses and trade unionists.  He will launch the tour later at a public meeting Dudley, in the West Midlands, with shadow home secretary Andy Burnham.  Mr Burnham said Labour "needs a plan to win back the voters we failed to convince on immigration".

"It is a genuine attempt to listen to and learn from the public on the issues of migration and refugees."	politics

Cutting immigration, curbing benefits and returning powers from Brussels are among the key aims of David Cameron's EU reform deal, but will any of it work in practice?  David Cameron fought hard to get a four year ban on new arrivals from other EU nations claiming in-work benefits, such as tax credits, which top up low wages.  It will not be a blanket ban, as he had wanted, but will be graduated, so the longer migrants work in the UK, the more benefits they will become entitled to.  The prime minister insists this will "make a difference" to high levels of immigration by reducing one of the main "pull factors" attracting people to the UK.  But there is little direct evidence to suggest it will work.  Sir Stephen Nickell, a senior economist at the Office for Budget Responsibility, said last year he believed it was "unlikely to have a huge impact".  The main "pull factor" for migrants is the availability of jobs, according to Oxford University's Migration Observatory, and campaign group Migration Watch.  Benefits might prove to be an attraction to some, but most EU-born migrant workers are single or childless couples who do not claim a lot of tax credits, researchers say.  Migration Watch said Mr Cameron's "emergency brake" on benefits would be "unlikely to have any significant effect on levels of migration".  Some campaigners have suggested that increasing the amount of benefits people can receive each year will encourage them to remain in Britain.  The in-work benefit ban was dreamed up by influential think tank Open Europe (its former boss Mats Persson is now Mr Cameron's chief adviser on EU reform).  It argued in a November 2014 paper, that banning in-work benefits would mean take-home pay could drop below that which migrants would receive in their home states - they used Poland, Bulgaria and Spain as their examples - meaning that a move to the UK would no longer make financial sense.  But the UK's plan to increase its minimum wage to £9 an hour for over-25s by 2020, which the government claims will remove the need to top-up wages with benefits, could undermine that argument.  Also, it is not clear how checks would be made on how long people have actually been in the UK. Some regularly travel in and out of the UK or return to their home country to see family for a few months at a time.  The UK spends about £30m a year on child benefit payments for children that do not live in the UK.  About 20,000 EU nationals receive the payment in respect of 34,000 children in their country of origin.  A majority of those payments go to children resident in Poland, but several thousand Irish and French citizens resident in the UK also receive UK child benefit payments for children residing elsewhere.  David Cameron wanted to change EU rules to end this, but instead he has been offered a deal under which child benefit will be paid in line with the wages in the country where the child is living.  UK child benefit is £20.40 a week for the first child, about 5% of the average income. Under the proposed new rules, that might be reduced to £3.50 for a child living in Romania, where wages are low.  But it might also mean the UK will pay higher levels of child benefit for than it currently does for children living in countries with higher average wages.  There are also concerns that the Department for Work and Pensions will struggle to cope with calculating 28 different rates of child benefit, for each member state.  Officials have also told the BBC they are unsure how they can be certain where the children of migrants are resident.  David Cameron secured a clear legal statement that the UK was not committed to further political integration and that the phrase "ever closer union" cannot be used to integrate the EU further. But it is not yet clear when or how this will be incorporated into the EU treaties.  He also got new powers for national parliaments to band together to block unwanted EU laws - but the thresholds are pretty high before those powers can be used.  The "red card" procedure can only be triggered if at least 15 national Parliaments, representing 55% of the EU's population, agree.  London Mayor Boris Johnson has said it would be better if the UK was able to block EU laws on its own without having to rely on the support of other EU nations.  In response to Mr Johnson's concerns, Mr Cameron revealed on Wednesday that he is planning to announced a measure that will put the sovereignty of the Westminster Parliament "beyond doubt".  Eurosceptic Tory MPs are pushing for a repeal or amendment of the European Communities Act 1972 to assert that UK law has primacy over EU law. But critics say this would be tantamount to leaving the EU.  Instead, the government is looking at ways of asserting parliamentary sovereignty that would question and challenge EU decisions but without causing constitutional chaos.  There is speculation Mr Cameron will make some kind of unilateral declaration of sovereignty, at the same time as he concludes his negotiations over Britain's reformed relationship with the EU.  And that he will use this to persuade Boris Johnson to vote to remain in the EU since this is an issue on which the mayor has campaigned for many months.  Downing Street is refusing to give details of the proposals which are being worked on by the Cabinet Office and the Ministry of Justice.  But Mr Cameron gave a hint last year in his November 10 Chatham House speech when he said ministers were looking at the way Germany used its constitutional court to test EU law.  He said then: "The Constitutional Court in Germany retains the right to review whether essential constitutional freedoms are respected when powers are transferred to Europe. And it also reserves the right to review legal acts by European institutions and courts to check that they remain within the scope of the EU's powers, or whether they have overstepped the mark. We will consider how this could be done in the UK."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35482216	Date site users regularly scammed	Almost half of the people who use dating sites and apps have been scammed or spammed, suggests research.  Carried out by security firm Symantec, the study quizzed more than 3,000 people across Europe about what happened when they searched for love.  Daters fell victim to blackmail, were subjected to revenge porn and were tricked by people who assumed fake identities to steal cash.  One expert said scammers pass around lists of people who are susceptible.  While most people found what they were looking for via dating apps and sites, for some it was a more fraught experience that cost them much emotionally and sometimes financially, said Nick Shaw, European head of Symantec's Norton division.  "When people go online looking for love and affection they may not be as vigilant as they might be elsewhere," he said. "They look for the good rather than the bad."  The research showed that 48% of those questioned in the UK, France and Germany for the survey had received spam and scam messages from others on dating services.  Around 32% had received requests for cash from the people they got talking to and 28% had been catfished - ie tricked by someone who had assumed a fake identity by stealing images or videos.  About 32% had been threatened with the release of compromising images they had shared and 11% had seen this content put online without their consent.  Mr Shaw said many dating scams were run by gangs who used software 'bots' to draw in victims who were then passed to others who started the process of getting to know them, with a view to stealing information or cash.  "There is a lot of money swilling around in the online dating world and criminals will always go where there is money," he said.  Professor Monica Whitty from the University of Leicester, who has studied online daters who have been scammed, said con artists worked hard to quickly build up trust with victims. Often, she said, they would attempt to move the communication off a dating site to foster closer links.  "It's a real grooming process," she said. "It can be very effective and can mean the little bits of evidence that suggest this is not real people will tend to be pushed aside."  Often, said Prof Whitty, people who are conned get put on a "suckers list" that is passed around or sold online so other gangs can go after the same person.  Tony Neate, chief executive of the Get Safe Online campaign, said the dangers of online dating should not be overblown.  "The actual number of people being conned is relatively small," he said, "but you have to be aware of it. Often the big thing is not the loss of money, it's the loss of personal worth and the effect on their family."	tech

The firm said net income losses came to $34.5m (£23.67m) for the period, compared with a profit of $122.3m.  It also said revenue for the current quarter would come in well below expectations.  GoPro has been facing competition from cheaper devices made by Chinese rivals.  In its earnings statement, GoPro also announced that Brian McGee would take over as chief financial officer from Jack Lazar from next month and that it would cut production of some of its action cameras.  GoPro's new action cameras will now only include the Hero4 Black, the Hero4 Silver and the Hero4 Session.  In December, the firm re-priced its Hero4 cameras, which dented the firm's overall sales results. GoPro had said there had been weaker-than-expected demand for the device because of its initial high price.  As its earnings were released in the US, trading in the firm's shares was halted. When trading resumed after hours, its shares fell as much as 19% before recovering later to be down 8.5%.  The firm was nevertheless upbeat about its revenue numbers.  "In 2015, we recorded 16% year-over-year revenue growth and the fourth quarter represented the second highest revenue quarter in the company's history," said chief executive and founder Nicholas Woodman.  "However, growth slowed in the second half of the year and we recognize the need to develop software solutions that make it easier for our customers to offload, access and edit their GoPro content," he added.  Last month, shares of GoPro plunged as much as 28% in after-hours trading after the company said its revenue would come in below expectations.  In the year-to-date, the company's shares have lost 40.5%.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35478408	Fiscal framework: Scotland Bill Lords passage delayed	The Scotland Bill's passage through the House of Lords has been delayed while wrangling over the fiscal framework continues.  Peers were due to resume line-by-line scrutiny on 9 February but that has now been put back until 22 February.  The Scottish government wants a deal concluded by 12 February to allow time for it to be examined at Holyrood.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell has informed Holyrood's Devolution Committee of the delay.  The negotiations on the fiscal framework - the financial arrangements underpinning the transfer of new powers to the Scottish Parliament - have proved both protracted and complicated.  The Scottish government has said there is still "some distance to go" before a deal can be agreed and threatened to veto any formula that was "unfair to Scotland".  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned recently that Scotland stood to lose billions of pounds over the next few years under the Treasury's current proposals.  Talks between the two governments are due to resume in Edinburgh on Monday.  In a letter to Holyrood's Devolution Committee, Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: "The fiscal framework talks are continuing, and I am optimistic about the process. I am doing everything I can to secure an agreement which is durable and fair to taxpayers in Scotland and the rest of the UK.  "All through the process we have made time for these issues to be properly considered and discussed, and that remains the case.  "I want to ensure both the Scottish Parliament and the House of Lords have as much information as possible for their consideration. It has been agreed, therefore, that the next parliamentary stage of the Scotland Bill will be rescheduled.  "This will allow more time for negotiations between the Scottish and UK Governments to progress. I am confident both parliaments will have the opportunity to properly consider the Scotland Bill and the fiscal framework before the Scottish Parliament's dissolution on March 23."  Deputy First Minister John Swinney responded to Mr Mundell's letter, promising the Scottish government would do "all we can" to secure an agreement.  But he added: "We will not sign up to any proposed agreement which short changes Scotland by locking in long-term cuts to our budget.  "We are working to a deadline of February 12th for talks to be concluded because the Scottish Parliament requested this, as members need time to properly scrutinise and vote on an agreed fiscal framework package before it is dissolved next month ahead of May's election - but we will give all the time possible to secure a deal."  Earlier the Treasury minister negotiating on behalf of the UK government said he was "confident" a deal would be reached.  Greg Hands said he had cleared his diary for a full day of talks in Edinburgh next Monday and he remained "upbeat" that an agreement would be struck.  What is the fiscal framework?  He told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee: "I'm ready to deal. I'm off to Edinburgh on Monday and I remain upbeat on that possibility.  "The UK government remains committed to getting that deal."  An agreement would set out how Scotland's annual block grant from the Treasury will be adjusted to take account of the new tax powers.  Mr Hands insisted the proposals will provide "huge new opportunities" for the Scottish government to grow the economy.  The deal must be "fair to taxpayers in Scotland and fair to taxpayers in the rest of the UK", he told the committee.  Mr Hands said: "Neither Scotland nor the rest of the UK should be better or worse off as result of the initial act of devolution.  "Thereafter, the Scottish government should bear the fruit of good policy decisions and the consequences of poor policy decisions."  The committee chairman, SNP MP Pete Wishart, warned that Mr Hands and Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney appeared to have "very different perspectives" on the long-running negotiations.  "There does seem to be some distance to go in terms of getting an agreement on this," Mr Wishart said.  Scottish Labour had earlier called for the 12 February deadline to be abandoned, and said neither side should walk away until a deal is reached.  The party has criticised a lack of transparency in negotiations and called on minutes of meetings to be published.  Shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray said: "Over the past few days we have seen the negotiations descend into a blame game.  "People across Scotland will not understand that after the negotiation for more powers, this deal could fall apart at the last minute."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35481976	Winning Hyperloop design revealed by MIT engineers	Designs for passenger pods that could travel through airless tubes have been revealed by a team from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  The Hyperloop is a conceptual transport system in which passenger pods could be fired through vacuum tubes at more than 600mph (1,000km/h).  The MIT team came first in a SpaceX competition to design pods that could be tested in a prototype tube.  The team will now have the opportunity to build and test its design in the US.  Elon Musk - the entrepreneur behind companies such as Paypal, SpaceX, and Tesla Motors - announced his vision for a Hyperloop transport system in August 2013.  Although SpaceX is not developing its own commercial Hyperloop, the company says it wants to "accelerate development" of the idea and is building a mile-long test track in California.  The winning entries in the company's design competition will now have the opportunity to test them in full-scale tubes over the summer.  Describing his team's winning design, chief engineer Chris Merian said: "Our pod focuses on levitating as well as moving at really high speeds."  "Those are the two things that we see as crucial to this being a true Hyperloop pod," he added.  To help reassure potentially nervous riders, the MIT designers have included fail-safe brakes, which would stop the pod if the computer systems failed.  However the design currently does not have space for cargo or passengers.  More than 115 teams entered the design competition, with the MIT engineers scooping the Best Overall Design prize.  Twenty-two teams will go on to test their pod designs on the SpaceX test track.  Speaking at the award ceremony in Texas on Saturday, Mr Musk described the next stage of the competition.  "The basic idea with the competition is we're going to try to get the highest possible speed in the 1.5 km (one mile) track, and then of course you have to stop before the end.  "There will be foam put at the end, so you might recover some pieces of your pod," he told an enthusiastic audience.  "The goal is to come up with something that could ultimately be used. If you were to extend the track to hundreds of kilometres, the system would still work.  "What we intended to do with Hyperloop was really to spur interest in new forms of transportation, and I'm starting to think this is really going to happen.  "It's clear that the public and the world wants something new."	tech

In an interview with the BBC's political editor, Mr Cameron said "I'm not saying I've solved all the problems with Europe but this is a big step forward."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35483522	David Cameron urged to delay EU referendum by first ministers	The first ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have urged David Cameron not to hold an EU referendum in June, saying it will "distract" from devolved elections taking place in May.  Nicola Sturgeon, Carwyn Jones and Arlene Foster have written to the PM to urge him to defer the date.  They say a June date will "confuse" the process and make it hard for them to campaign effectively in the referendum.  Mr Cameron told MPs that voters were able to differentiate between polls.  David Cameron has pledged to hold the referendum by the end of 2017 but said he wants to get on with it and is reported to favour a poll on 23 June.  However, the exact timing hinges on whether EU leaders agree to the draft package of reforms published on Tuesday at a summit next month, which would pave the way for a poll at the end of June.  In their letter, the three first ministers say it is vital that voters are properly informed about the issue at stake in the referendum and this could be compromised if the campaign overlaps with that for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and Stormont Parliament on 5 May.  "We believe that holding a referendum as early as June will mean that a significant part of the referendum campaign will necessarily run in parallel with those elections and risks confusing issues at a moment when clarity is required," they write.  Opposition in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to an early referendum has been building in recent weeks.  There is concern that a date just weeks after the 5 May election would mean the campaigns become confused or there wouldn't be time to properly consider the European issue.  It is interesting to note the Labour Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones has signed this letter.  Nationally his party favours a June vote - Alan Johnson, the leader of the Labour In campaign said yesterday his party would not stand in the way of a 23 June referendum. And last night, Scottish Labour's leader Kezia Dugdale told BBC Scotland she was happy for the vote to be held then.  But expect continued pressure from devolved governments and administrations on this issue. Even if David Cameron can persuade other European leaders of his renegotiation plans, it's possible he will face significant opposition domestically on the date.  "Furthermore, it will be virtually impossible for the political parties in our respective territories to plan effectively for, and where appropriate work together on, the referendum campaign while our own elections are in progress.  "We believe that the European Referendum is of vital importance to the future of the whole United Kingdom and the debate leading up to it should, therefore, be free of other campaigning distraction."  Raising the letter during Prime Minister's Questions, the SNP's Angus Robertson said the PM should show "respect" for the voters in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and make a commitment not to hold the poll in June.  Mr Cameron said no date had been agreed but he could guarantee that the referendum would not be held within six weeks of devolved elections, which he claimed had been asked for by former Scottish first minister Alex Salmond.  "I respect the electorates of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland on the basis that I think people are perfectly able of making up their minds in a local election or Scottish Parliamentary election and then a period of some weeks later making up their mind all over again on the vital question of the European Union," he said.  "No date has been fixed and there must be a six-week gap but, frankly, I think he is looking for things to complain about."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35481975	Twitter launches 'engaging' new homepage	Twitter is rolling out a new homepage designed to engage people who have not logged in to the website.  The new page shows real-time updates from celebrities and news websites, and lets people search through tweets.  The design was trialled in the US and Japan and will now roll out in a further 21 countries, including the UK.  One analyst said the company was trying to widen its appeal, but needed to tackle issues that could put people off using the service.  "The old homepage was targeted at getting people to sign up for an account or download the app," said David Wilkinson, managing partner at digital consultancy Soho Strategy.  "This is a bid to expand its appeal beyond the registered users, and get people to engage with content regardless of whether they're signed in.  "But it's also a recognition that algorithmic curation of content is beating human curation, and that its timeline model could be flawed."  Twitter has struggled with competition from rivals such as Snapchat and Facebook, and its share price has tumbled since its stock market debut in 2014.  The social network currently attracts about 500 million visitors every month, but has only 320 million registered members.  The redesigned homepage, which will roll out on the Twitter website and mobile site, draws in live updates from some of the website's most prolific tweeters.  "Starting today, anyone can explore and discover different topics and stories as they occur, including some that are tailored just for you based on your location," the company said in a statement.  Previously, the website's homepage outside the US and Japan displayed only a large photograph and a log-in panel, without indicating what registered users could do or see on the website.  "It shows Twitter's recognition that an algorithmic way of curating content, like on Facebook, is something that might interest people," said Mr Wilkinson.  "It's still a huge platform for brands and celebrities to communicate with the public, and they can now reach a larger audience outside of those who follow them.  "But they're playing catch-up when it comes to curating content, and this shows they're developing their own means of filtering."	tech

Oliver Blume told German newspaper Westfalen-Blatt that people wanted "to drive a Porsche by oneself".  He added that Porsche did not need to team up with any tech firms.  Analysts Boston Consulting Group predict that by 2025, 13% of cars will have autonomous features.  Porsche does, however, intend to launch electric vehicles, and a plug-in hybrid of the 911 model with a range of 50 km (31 miles) will hit the market as early as 2018, Mr Blume said.  Porsche also plans to spend about 1bn euros ($1.1bn) on production facilities to build the Mission E, its first-ever all-electric model, a move reflecting parent VW's growing commitment to increase its electric offerings as it struggles to overcome an emissions scandal.  VW, along with most of the big carmakers, has signalled its intention to work on driverless cars and at tech show CES revealed a partnership with Mobileye, which produces real-time image processing cameras. It plans to put the cameras in future cars to create high definition maps of roads and environments as a basis for driverless cars.  Meanwhile rival Ford is expected to announce a tie-up with Google to work on its driverless cars.  Tesla boss Elon Musk predicts that it will have a fully self-driving car by 2018.	tech

The company said it was a "milestone" in its history.  "Our mission is to enhance interaction between people and technology. We think these are a perfect match, and we believe joining Microsoft is the right next stage in our journey," said SwiftKey's founders Jon Reynolds and Ben Medlock in a blog post.  The company is the latest UK artificial intelligence (AI) firm to be bought up by a US tech giant.  DeepMind - which began within the University of Oxford - was bought by Google in 2014, for £400m. Another firm, VocalIQ, was bought recently by Apple.  As well as the popular smartphone app, SwiftKey is known for being behind the computer software on Prof Stephen Hawking's wheelchair.  The deal furthers Microsoft's new mobile strategy, spearheaded by chief executive Satya Nadella.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35479059	Public 'not told' about local devolution deals, MPs say	Councils in England must do a better job of telling residents about new powers they are being given by Whitehall, MPs have said.  The government's "devolution revolution" to councils includes housing, transport and planning.  The Communities and Local Government Committee welcomed the policy but said there was a "significant lack of public consultation" in the process.  Councils said they recognised the "need for greater public engagement".  Greater Manchester has been at the forefront of the government's move to devolve powers and spending controls to local government through a series of "deals" with each area.  Chancellor George Osborne has hailed Manchester's deal as creating a "Northern Powerhouse", and similar agreements have been struck with other regions in England, which have to adopt ministers' preferred model of an elected mayor in return.  The committee said it strongly supported the principle of devolution, saying the current deals "should be the starting point, not the destination".  But the MPs, who held a public evidence session in Greater Manchester as part of their inquiry, also said many people had complained about a lack of consultation.  "The vast majority of contributions, often made in angry tones, arose from the perceived lack of efforts by the combined authority to engage the public about the deal relating to their local area," the committee said.  "For devolution to take root and fulfil its aims, it needs to involve and engage the people it is designed to benefit. There has been a consistent very significant lack of public consultation, engagement and communication at all stages of the deal-making process."  Council leaders from other parts of the country told the committee the public had not been consulted before their deals were agreed.  It is particularly important to engage the public where health powers are being devolved, the MPs said, because "the public's response is likely to be more emotional".  The committee said the government had driven the first wave of devolution deals through "at rapid pace", which meant "no opportunity for engagement with residents", but said council leaders should still have communicated the deal to residents and told them how they would be affected.  The Department for Communities and Local Government said it welcomed the committee's support for its "devolution revolution" and said there was "no one-size-fits-all approach" for different areas.  Local Government Association chairman Lord Porter said: "While it is right that devolution deals are not imposed, but negotiated and secured by local places, we recognise the need for greater public engagement throughout the deal-making process and are working with councils to support them in this."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35479636	Uber drops its U. Why?	Before someone shouts "is Uber changing its logo really news?", let me answer that for you: no, it probably isn't.  Yet, much like my Dad's sensational perm in the 70s, a striking new look can turn heads and get everyone talking.  But, much like my Dad's sensational moustache in the 90s, not always in a good way.  On Tuesday, the controversial but extremely popular ride-sharing service unveiled its sweeping new look.  Gone is surely the world's most recognisable "U", and in its place, an image that looks like - according to my followers on Twitter - something in between a broken polo mint and an ancient Chinese coin.  For a subdued, soft-spoken view on the company's thinking, I approached Ed Zitron.  He runs EZPR, a media relations and branding agency based in San Francisco.  "It's hilarious!" he said.  "It's just quite incredible, a company that is so desperate to appear at least remotely reliable and cuddly has chosen the most robotic, Big Brother logo they could have gone for - short of just using the cover of 1984."  Well, that's one review, I suppose.  Here's how the company itself described it.  "The old Uber was black and white, somewhat distant and cold," wrote Travis Kalanick, Uber's founder and chief executive.  "This belied what Uber actually is - a transportation network, woven into the fabric of cities and how they move. To bring out this human side - the atoms - we've added color and patterns.  "The team has spent months researching architecture, textiles, scenery, art, fashion, people and more to come up with authentic identities for the countries where Uber operates."  The "authentic identity" aspect relates to colours. If you're in Ireland, your Uber app (if you can find it anymore) will be made up of different colours than if you were in, say, China.  "In Mexico," Mr Kalanick writes, "we were inspired by Mexican pink and the patterns in the local tiles; in Ireland, from the Georgian architecture and the lush greens; and in Nigeria, from the ankara, which came up again and again because of its bright colours and beautiful geometric patterns."  The rest of the company's announcement is, of course, good old-fashioned brand-friendly mumbo-jumbo. The sort we're all used to, whether it's the new Pepsi logo, or the storm-in-a-teacup around the logo for London 2012.  For a more revealing look at the thought process, we can turn to Wired magazine, which was given the "inside view" of the rebranding.  It tells how Mr Kalanick played an extremely hands-on role in the design - "usually a bad sign," says Ed Zitron - and that he was very nervous revealing it to his employees.  To quote Wired's ominous words: "Kalanick is not a designer. He's an engineer by training and an entrepreneur by nature. Yet he refused to entrust the rebranding to anyone else."  The article goes on to talk about subdued smirks among Mr Kalanick's staff as they discussed working on his "unique" approach.  If you're one of the many millions of Uber users around the world, the app's logo has probably already changed. Familiarise yourself with it now as, in the haze of a post-pub search for a cab, you may forget such a change has been made.  Big changes to a brand's image are almost always laughed at. The more daring, the more laughs and claims a six-year-old could have done better.  Most daring for Uber is getting rid of the U. When an Uber pulls up, it's the U that reassures you in the window. And few Silicon Valley companies dare stray from having some aspect of their name in the logo. Think Google, with its new G, or Facebook's F.  Let's hold too much judgment on whether this is a good call by Mr Kalanick. In most cases, people slowly get used to a new look and forget it was ever even a subject for debate.  And let's face it: Uber, with its enormous marketing budget, could make its logo a picture of a soggy tea-bag and still make a success of it.

The agreement should head off the threat that both tech giants and smaller companies would be unable to send personal information for processing in US data centres.  It follows a court ruling last year that invalidated an earlier data transfer mechanism called Safe Harbour.  The announcement was welcomed by businesses.  However privacy groups still have concerns.  The British lobby group TechUK was quick to hail the news.  "The European Commission and US administration must now show total commitment to implementing this agreement and getting trans-Atlantic data flows back onto a secure and stable legal footing," said its deputy chief executive Antony Walker.  "Businesses large and small across Europe need reliable and affordable legal mechanisms to enable the data transfers that underpin their operations and ability to serve customers.  "The fact that EU and US negotiators have worked day and night for several months to secure this agreement reflects how important transatlantic data flows are to the global digital economy."  The deal coincides with a two-day meeting of EU data protection watchdogs in Brussels.  Many had predicted the regulators would block transfers that had been authorised by the earlier Safe Harbour pact as well as by other legal means, potentially causing havoc.  Not only might Facebook, Google and Apple have been restricted from sending data to the US to be used by their cloud services, but European firms might also have been unable to rely on American firms to process their payrolls and carry out other backroom tasks.  It might also have disrupted US-based travel websites from processing customers' bookings and European's online purchases from being completed.  The European Court of Justice ruled against Safe Harbour in October following leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden that suggested the US security services were scrutinising foreigners' personal data held in the US.  For the previous 15 years, thousands of US companies had been able to self-certify that they had taken the necessary steps to protect data to avoid having to seek permission for each new type of transfer.  Negotiators for the European Commission and the US State Department had already been attempting to formulate a new deal for months, but the ruling put them under pressure to conclude the talks.  "This solution is much better than the one we had in the year 2000," commented Andrus Ansip, the European Commissioner for the digital single market.  The new agreement is called the EU-US Privacy Shield. Under its terms:  The privacy campaigner Max Schrems prompted Safe Harbour's demise when he demanded the Irish data watchdog audit Facebook to see if it was willingly sharing data with the NSA - a charge the social network denies.  He has concerns about the new deal.  "A couple of letters by the outgoing Obama administration is by no means a legal basis to guarantee the fundamental rights of 500 million European users in the long run, when there is explicit US law allowing mass surveillance," he wrote.  "We don't know the exact legal structure yet, but this could amount to obviously disregarding the [ECJ's] judgement.  "The court has clearly stated that the US has to 'ensure' proper protection by means of 'domestic law or international commitments'.  "I doubt that a European can walk into a US court and claim his fundamental rights based on a letter by someone."  A lawyer based in Silicon Valley has also raised concerns.  "Keeping in mind that this new Safe Harbour will almost certainly be challenged by civil liberties groups - and possibly even some data protection authorities - pretty much immediately, only the foolhardy would place want to place their trust in a new Safe Harbour right now," said Phil Lee from the law firm Fieldfisher.  "Whether legal or not, its reputation is already shot to pieces."  EU watchdogs are expected to make their views known on Wednesday.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35475935	Councils to get Sunday trading powers	Ministers are to press ahead with plans to allow councils in England and Wales to relax Sunday trading laws.  Business Secretary Sajid Javid said the move would allow local authorities to "help struggling High Streets".  He told MPs the policy, previously reported to be facing strong opposition in the Commons, would be added to the government's Enterprise Bill.  Unions said ministers were "behaving disgracefully by trying to change Sunday trading by the back door".  Devolving Sunday trading laws to councils was first announced by George Osborne in the July Budget, and a consultation into the change closed in September.  Small shops - up to 280 sq m - are currently entitled to open when they want, but on Sundays, larger stores are restricted to six hours between 10:00 and 18:00.  In the Commons, Mr Javid's Labour shadow Angela Eagle criticised the way the government was seeking to make the change and as well as what she said was a lack of detail.  She accused Mr Javid of a "gross abuse of power" asking why the plans were being added "at this late stage" rather than being in the Bill from the start.  Mr Javid said the government's intentions "have been clear" and said amending the Enterprise Bill, which is currently making its way through the Commons, was "the right vehicle to make those changes".  He told MPs the decision to change Sunday trading hours would be "entirely local", adding: "If the people of Bromsgrove or Barking say they want to see longer Sunday opening hours, who are we here in Westminster to stand in their way?"  Under the proposals, local authorities will be able to restrict the longer hours to certain zones - such as High Streets and city centres, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said.  It promised that shop workers who wanted to "opt out" of working on Sundays would be able to do so, for example on religious or family grounds.  The response to the consultation would be published "shortly", the government said.  Retail union Usdaw said MPs should be able to "properly consider" the views expressed in the consultation.  General secretary John Hannett described the current Sunday Trading Act as a "great British compromise, which has worked well for over 20 years and gives everyone a little bit of what they want.  "Retailers can trade, customers can shop, staff can work; whilst Sunday remains a special day, different to other days, and shop workers can spend some time with their family."	politics

Gareth Cross, from Aberystwyth, Ceredigion, found a crack in the screen of his Apple Watch Sport 10 days after buying the £339 device last year.  Apple responded to an initial complaint by saying the problem was not covered by the warranty.  Mr Cross then successfully took his case to a small claims court for breach of the Sale of Goods Act.  Apple must pay Mr Cross a total of £429 - the cost of the watch plus court fees - by 22 February.  The legal action lasted six months, and Mr Cross - who describes himself as a "Mac fanatic and all-round geek" on Twitter - told the BBC: "I couldn't understand why they would want to go to court over the issue, but ultimately I wanted [to] stand by my consumer rights," he said.  "The case did start to become a little stressful, especially toward the end with the prospect of having to attend court to defend my claim against what was the most valuable company in the world."  Mr Cross added that he had been "relieved" when the judge ruled Apple had breached the contract of sale by refusing to fix the watch.  "I plan to buy another Apple Watch, as for the 10 days I had it, I really liked it," said Mr Cross, "but I may wait until the next model is out."  Apple has been approached for comment.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35472884	Security flaws found in smart tech	New research has highlighted security issues on four separate smart gadgets.  A smart doorbell, a connected camera, a child's toy and a locator to help monitor children were all found to be vulnerable to straightforward attacks.  The default passwords and bad security practices could have leaked data to attackers, said the research teams.  However, all four firms have acted on the warnings, tightened up code and closed loopholes.  "The problem with the Internet of Things these days is that everyone is becoming an IT shop whether they like it or not and whether they realise it or not," said Tod Beardsley, security research manager at Rapid7, who uncovered problems with two of the devices.  While IoT device makers were writing code more confidently, few took the extra design steps to make sure the programming they put into smart devices was secure, the researchers found.  Mr Beardsley checked the security in two devices from separate firms:  The way the bear communicated with the web was poorly configured, he found, so attackers could have interrogated it to find out more about its young owner, their family and home network.  Similar problems were found with the HereO watch that could have let an attacker add themselves to a group of watches used by a family or other group.  Separately, researchers at Context IS uncovered security issues with a Motorola Focus outdoor camera.  If exploited, the lapses could allow a camera to be taken over and remotely controlled by an attacker and used as an entrance to infiltrate a network to which it was connected.  Security experts at Pentest Partners also found problems with Ring - a smart doorbell fitted with a video camera that uses an app to beam video of callers to a phone.  But by removing the cover of the gadget and pressing its set-up key it becomes possible to recover the key to the wi-fi network to which it is joined, found the security testing firm.  All the security failings found by the researchers were reported to the respective firms and all have now been patched or fixed.  Ken Munro from Pentest Partners said Era Home Security was "quick to respond" to the report of the bug.  Tod Beardsley from Rapid7 said getting the security bugs fixed in the two devices he studied was a "good and surprising outcome".  "I was expecting the usual emotional response of, 'How dare you hack our stuff?' and 'What's your motivation?'" he told the BBC.  "But both firms were very mature about it."  He added that there were no reports of IoT devices being targeted by attackers as yet but security firms were keen to get product designers thinking about ways to secure their creations as soon as possible.  Industry initiatives such as BuildItSecure.ly have been created that attempt to educate gadget makers about secure coding.  "We are seeing the deployment of Internet of Things devices accelerate," he said, "but we can still get ahead of the curve and prevent some future disasters."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35463347	UK radio disturbance caused by satellite network bug	An error with the Global Positioning System (GPS) network has been blamed for causing problems with digital radio broadcasts last week.  The US Air Force said that removing a satellite from service had caused a software error.  A BBC spokesman confirmed that the decommissioning of a GPS satellite led to difficulties for listeners receiving digital radio signals.  The BBC understands several other satellites were affected.  "I live on the Worksop side of Sheffield and for the past two days the reception of the BBC National Ensemble [BBC radio stations] has been virtually non-existent indoors," wrote Darcy72 on Digital Spy's online forums last week.  In a response to the reported issues, the BBC said: "The outages were caused by a rogue GPS satellite (SVN23), which was taken out of service in the evening of 26 January."  The BBC has now learned that the problem occurred after a decommissioned satellite caused software problems which affected several other satellites.  DAB transmitters must broadcast at exactly the same frequencies and, in order to synchronise, they lock on to GPS satellite signals.  The GPS signals themselves broadcast the time and are supposed to be accurate to within a few nanoseconds.  However, on 26 January, one of the GPS satellites - named SVN23 - orbiting the Earth was decommissioned.  This unexpectedly caused problems for the whole network.  "While the core navigation systems were working normally, the co-ordinated universal time timing signal was off by 13 microseconds which exceeded the design specifications," said the US Air Force in a statement.  "The issue was resolved at 06:10 MST, however global users may have experienced GPS timing issues for several hours."  In fact, as a result of the problem, some GPS positioning would have been thrown off by nearly 4km.  The time discrepancy was picked up by the Metsahovi Radio Observatory in Finland.  It is not yet clear whether other systems around the world, such as navigational tools, were affected.  The BBC is still chasing the US Air Force for further details about the incident.  "They knew they were decommissioning it so shouldn't they have been aware this would happen?" questioned Prof Danielle George, a radio engineer at the University of Manchester.  "It was decommissioned after 25 years - actually it should have just had a seven-and-a-half-year lifespan so it lasted a lot longer than it should have done."  Prof George added that had there only been a problem with one satellite, DAB transmitters would probably not have experienced difficulties.  "They shouldn't have seen an issue with that because as far as I understand the way they work is they need two frequencies to lock and there are a number of GPS [signals] to look at," she told the BBC.  "This should be treated as a warning of what could go wrong," said Martyn Thomas, a fellow at the Royal Academy of Engineering who has criticised technological reliance on GPS.  "The world is dependent on GPS for a vast range of critical applications from navigation to financial trading, and precision docking of oil tankers to high tech farming."  In the future, Prof Thomas said, it was "essential" that there was back-up.	tech

WhatsApp and similar applications make it possible for news organisations to reach the far-flung corners of the globe where other media are often blocked.  Here are a few recent examples of how you have enhanced BBC News output by getting in touch via the app.  A total of 38 people were killed in an attack on a beach in Tunisia on 26 June 2015.  They were killed when a gunman, with links to so-called Islamic State extremists, opened fire on a beach in Sousse, outside two hotels.  He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and he threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives.  Eyewitness Anthony Ryan got in touch with us as the news was breaking.  He was able to tell us what was happening from his balcony. He could see his hotel's entertainers on the beach and could hear shouting.  He could also see that two people had been brought into the hotel next door on sun beds, and were badly injured.  Simon Philips shared his experience of the attacks in Paris on the night of Friday 13 November.  Gunmen and suicide bombers attacked a concert hall, a major stadium, restaurants and bars, almost simultaneously.  Mr Philips, a dual French and British citizen, was sitting with his girlfriend outside La Belle Equipe bar in the rue de Charonne in the 11th district, when two men opened fire on the terrace of the cafe.  He described what he had seen as "endless scenes of war".  "It was complete and utter chaos. The noise of the bullets outweighed those of screams and sirens afterwards," he said.  Earlier last year, we reported on the most powerful earthquake to have hit Nepal in decades.  Hundreds of people were killed, and many others were trapped and injured in the quake in April.  Many of the BBC's eyewitnesses to this quake came through WhatsApp, which is widely used in that part of the world.  Those affected ranged from local people to the region's many tourists and climbers on Mount Everest.  As well as keeping us informed of news stories, you have been telling us how you use WhatsApp every day.  Jean Macleod from Glasgow, UK, says she uses it every day to message her son, Ewan, in Australia.  "He's in Sydney and I'm in Glasgow. It keeps us in touch every morning and night, and if I didn't have it I'd completely crash as I miss him so much.  We're not always available at the same times, so it's a bonus alongside phone calls.  I use it on holiday too. Last year, on holidays in Uganda, I kept in touch with all my family including my daughter in London, and husband in Glasgow."  Mal Smith agrees: "I use WhatsApp to speak to relatives in Switzerland and for sending video and pictures to family and friends.  My mobile provider charges me extra for sending pictures over their network."  And Julia Kinsey says she uses it at home in rural Suffolk, UK. "Mobile signal is very patchy in our house," she said. "So I use it for communicating with family in London and friends nationwide. I would feel very isolated without it."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35472189	Microsoft tests underwater data centre	Microsoft has come up with a radical new way to store data - under the sea.  Testing of the firm's first underwater data centre - dubbed Leona Philpot after a character in an Xbox game- has just been completed in an initiative dubbed Project Natick.  Data centres are believed to consume up to 3% of the world's electricity, according to Greenpeace.  Large technology firms are keen to find energy efficient ways to store their increasing amounts of data.  Microsoft said its reasons for experimenting with underwater data centres were twofold.  Firstly, half the world's population is located within 125 miles (200km) of the coast so data centres in the sea would reduce latency - the time its takes data to travel from its source to customers.  But there were also environmental reasons for the trial. Putting the data centre in the ocean eliminated the need for cooling and, in future, if such centres could be colocated with offshore renewable energy sources, they could also produce zero emissions, according to Microsoft.  Its first underwater data centre operated 0.6 miles (1km) from the Californian coast from August to December 2015 and is now back at Microsoft's Redmond headquarters for analysis.  It was encased in steel and equipped with sensors to monitor the environmental conditions.  Greenpeace, which produces an annual report on how clean the the big technology firms are, believes Microsoft could do more.  "Experimental underwater data centres could be more sustainable if connected to offshore wind power, but Microsoft must focus more on investing in new renewable energy now. Microsoft is far behind Apple, Google and Facebook in sourcing renewable energy for existing data centres," said Tom Dowdall, a climate campaigner at Greenpeace.  Many tech firms are now considering new options for housing data - including moving them to countries with colder climates.  In 2013, Facebook opened a data centre in the far north of Sweden, in the mining town of Lulea, 70 miles from the Arctic Circle. The 84-acre site houses tens of thousands of computer servers and runs entirely on renewable energy generated by nearby hydroelectric schemes.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35471846	Nintendo's profit falls as talk of new NX console grows	Nintendo has reported a drop in profits, after relatively weak sales of games for its Wii U console.  The Japanese company's net income for the September-to-December quarter was 29.1 billion yen ($241m; £168m) - 36% lower than for the same period in 2014.  The results add to pressure on Nintendo to formally announce a new machine.  It has already started sending select developers a software kit for a forthcoming "Nintendo NX" console, according to the Wall Street Journal.  Nintendo pointed to the success of its Splatoon shooter and Super Mario Maker platform games for the Wii U, which have sold a combined total of 7.4 million copies to date.  But one company watcher said total sales of 10.25 million of Nintendo's own Wii U games over the last three months of the year were disappointing, reflecting fewer than one game sold for every Wii U bought to date, despite it being the Christmas period.  Part of that figure is accounted for by games bought by retailers that have not been sold to the public, and titles bundled with the 1.9 million new units of the console shipped over the three months.  "The history of how the Wii U was marketed and users' actual experiences have not lived up to expectations," said Piers Harding-Rolls, from the IHS consultancy.  "Even with some compelling games like Splatoon, they still haven't managed to drive sales of the platform."  Although other companies also publish titles for the Wii U, Nintendo's own games tend to dominate the market, which is not the case for Microsoft's Xbox One and Sony's PlayStation 4.  IHS now forecasts the Wii U will sell only a fifth of the number of consoles of its predecessor, the Wii, over its lifetime.  Nintendo's former chief executive Satoru Iwata died of cancer last July.  He had announced plans for a "non-wearable way to monitor health", but Nintendo has yet to reveal a related product.  Mr Iwata's successor, Tatsumi Kimishima, has taken the company in a new direction, promising to release smartphone apps as part of an alliance with the mobile games firm DeNA.  However, Mr Harding-Rolls said he believed Nintendo's main focus was on pushing out a successor to the Wii U.  "I think we'll definitely hear more about the NX at the E3 games expo [in June]," he said.  "It's also possible that we could also see a regional launch of the new product into the market this year, even if a global rollout has to wait."	tech

But a plan to license the format to other video-makers was met with a digital backlash, costing the brothers hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  They have now apologised and said trademark applications will be rescinded.  "Hello, we're here to apologise," The Fine Brothers, Rafi and Benny, wrote in a blog.  Some of The Fine Brothers' most successful series include Kids React, Teens React and YouTubers React.  Videos in a similar style have been produced by many YouTubers.  The duo responded to criticism that license agreements might be used to "police" online video by saying this was a "valid concern".  "Though we can assert our intentions are pure, there's no way to prove them," they added.  The trademark scheme, which they had named the React World program, has been discontinued, existing trademark applications have been rescinded and past YouTube copyright claims have also been dropped.  "This has been a hard week," the brothers wrote.  "[...] let's give ourselves a round of applause, internet," wrote Ryan Morrison on Reddit.  Mr Morrison, a video gamer turned lawyer, had been critical of The Fine Brothers' plans.  Previously, he had offered to support video-makers in a legal challenge to The Fine Brothers' trademark application.  "Things are as they should be.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35467800	China's Xiaomi phones on sale in the US for the first time	Phones made by China's Xiaomi - the world's third biggest smartphone maker - are going on sale in the US for the first time, albeit with some caveats.  The carrier US Mobile said it would be importing a range of Xiaomi handsets from China and selling them online from this week.  However, the imported phones will not include Xiaomi's latest devices such as the high-end Mi Note.  Further still, the phones will not run on high-speed 4G networks in the US.  US Mobile said it would also sell a handset from another giant Chinese manufacturer, Meizu.  PC Mag UK said the phones that US Mobile would make available online would include the Xiaomi Redmi 2 for $119 (£82.50), the Xiaomi Mi 3 for $135, the Meizu Note 2 for $149, and the Xiaomi Mi 4 for $219.  Xiaomi is widely described as China's Apple and is well-known across many parts of Asia for its affordable smartphones, which it sells at a fraction of the cost of an iPhone.  Early last year, the Beijing-based giant launched an online store for US customers offering products such as headphones.  In April, it launched its Mi 4i phone in India, its top market after mainland China, before introducing its phones to markets in Hong Kong, Singapore and Brazil.  Until this week, however, Xiaomi's phones have been virtually impossible to buy in the US.  "US consumers have traditionally had to compromise to afford incredible devices," said US Mobile founder and chief executive Ahmed Khattak.  "Now, with the launch of our marketplace, we are thrilled to offer complete range of exceptional smartphones for low monthly payments and to give our customers access to exceptional phones otherwise not available in the US"  US Mobile uses the T-Mobile network and prides itself on providing its customers inexpensive contract-free services for all kinds of handsets. The carrier said it would provide service and support for the Chinese-made phones.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35460131	Safe Harbour: Tech firms shudder as watchdogs meet	A meeting of EU data watchdogs is set to have wide-ranging ramifications for the way businesses handle data.  Regulators need to decide how to act in light of a court ruling last year that invalidated the Safe Harbour agreement with the US.  The pact made it relatively easy for companies to send personal information from Europe to data centres in the US for processing.  The data protection authorities are expected to make their views know on Wednesday at the end of the two-day event.  But their determination could affect tech giants including Google, Apple and Facebook - whose cloud services rely on such transfers - as well as thousands of smaller business who have outsourced payroll processing and other tasks to US-based organisations.  The EU forbids its citizens' personal data from being sent to places that don't guarantee "adequate" privacy protections.  In order to avoid this restriction bogging down transfers to the US, it was decided that American firms could self-certify that information sent to their data centres would be properly protected.  This Safe Harbour agreement came into force in 2000.  About 5,000 US companies took advantage of the deal to facilitate transfers.  In 2013, the whistleblower Edward Snowden leaked a mass of documents detailing the US security services' cyber-spying operations.  In light of the revelations, an Austrian privacy campaigner - Max Schrems - asked Ireland's data regulator to audit what information Facebook might be sharing with the NSA.  It declined citing Safe Harbour, but the matter was referred up to the European Court of Justice.  Last October, the court ruled that the the decision to enable Safe Harbour was invalid, and as a consequence national data watchdogs could indeed review transfers on an individual basis.  The EU and US had already been negotiating a new data transfer pact for some time, dubbed Safer Harbour.  The aim is to give European citizens greater privacy safeguards without stopping US tech firms from being innovative.  The watchdogs opted to observe a grace period in order to see if a new pact might be agreed before 31 January that would influence their decision.  Although negotiators are reported to have made progress, no new deal has yet been agreed.  Right. Many of the firms affected initially thought the ruling would just be an inconvenience as they could get their lawyers to draw up papers known as "model contract clauses" and "binding corporate rules" to keep the transfers legal.  This might have involved a lot more work, but the companies believed that the contracts - already used to send data to other parts of the world - could also be used to authorise the use of US data centres.  However, many expect the regulators will think that would be against the spirit of the ECJ's ruling.  "When you look at the grounds the court used to invalidate Safe Harbour, you could apply more or less verbatim the same reasons to invalidate the alternative methods," commented Annabelle Richard, a lawyer at Pinsent Masons.  "That would make it extremely difficult to export date from the EU to the US.  "It would become almost an exception to have permission, and I don't see how in reality that could work out because many companies depend on the transfers from an economic perspective."  What are the tech giants saying?  The big tech firms declined to provide comment for this article, but several indicated that, at the very least, they needed clarity on what the rules now were.  "Some organisations have sought to repatriate data and minimise the number of data transfers that they have to undertake," added Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of the lobby group TechUK.  "But other companies' structures and processes mean that's almost impossible to do."  European Commission and US government negotiators could still clinch a deal.  It has emerged that the Americans have offered to appoint an ombudsman to oversee complaints and respond to inquiries about alleged privacy breaches as part of a proposed Safer Harbour deal.  The Europeans still want guarantees that such an official would have real teeth and would not stay quiet if the security services were found to have overstepped their bounds.  But the point is that if the data watchdogs believe that a deal is close they may try and fudge Wednesday's announcement to give the talks more time.  The alternative is that the regulators do indeed try and enforce a data transfer clampdown.  One of the tech companies has suggested that if that happens there would be legal grounds to challenge the move and seek to bring the matter back before the ECJ.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35459812	WhatsApp reaches a billion monthly users	Mobile messaging service WhatsApp is now used by a billion people every month, Facebook has reported.  The Facebook-owned app now outperforms the social network's own Messenger mobile app, which has 800 million monthly users.  The company said 42 billion messages and 250 million videos were sent over WhatsApp daily.  But one analyst said WhatsApp still trailed behind local competition in some key markets.  "There are big markets where WhatsApp isn't the dominant player," said Jack Kent, mobile analyst at IHS.  "WeChat in China has more than 500 million users, while Line is popular in Japan, and Kakao Talk is big in South Korea. But WhatsApp is certainly the most internationally successful.  "Part of that is down to its pure focus on communication, providing low cost chat that is very reliable.  "Other apps have focused on monetisation, games and stickers but WhatsApp's appeal is that it is light on monetisation and it has now dropped its small annual fee completely."  Facebook bought the mobile messaging app in 2014, in a deal worth $19bn (£11.4bn).  The usage data the platform generates for Facebook could help the company improve its targeted advertising, which is its core business model, said Mr Kent.  "Facebook had just started pushing people to its own standalone Messenger app, when it bought WhatsApp. But there was a risk it could have been acquired by a competitor and Facebook would lose millions of highly-engaged mobile users to a rival," he said.  "But WhatsApp still faces those challenges from domestic players who monetise their services very well. It remains a competitive area."	tech

The Fine Brothers produce a popular series of "reaction videos", in which people watch online clips and respond.  On Tuesday, they revealed a scheme to let other video-makers use assets from their version of the format.  But they have faced a backlash from viewers for trademarking "react" - a term widely used by other creators.  Typically, reaction videos feature a group of people, for example children or YouTube personalities, looking at an object or video and talking about it.  The format is hugely popular on YouTube, and countless content creators, including US chat show host Ellen DeGeneres, have produced videos in this style.  Reaction videos have proved particularly successful for the Fine Brothers, who produce a number of regular series, including Kids React, Teens React and YouTubers React.  In 2015, the brothers applied to trademark terms, including "Kids React", "Adults React" and "Celebrities React", as well as the word "react" itself, which could be used to form new variations of the format.  On Tuesday, the brothers announced a licensing scheme called React World, which they said would let other video-makers use the "react" title and assets such as their graphics and music.  But the plan was negatively received by the YouTube community because so many people already make similar reaction-based videos online, using the word "react" in the title.  "They had a bunch of trademarks already and nobody minded," said Jon, a YouTuber from Many A True Nerd.  "But the moment they got to just the word 'react', it was just too commonly used.  "People aren't sure whether they will fall foul of the trademark.  "As creators, we have sympathy that you want to protect your content from being stolen - but in this case it's too far," he told the BBC.  The Fine Brothers have insisted they are planning to license only a complete package of "structural elements" and assets - in the same way any television company can produce a singing talent show, but a complete format such as the X Factor is protected.  However, critics of the Fine Brothers have expressed concern they may use the trademarks to stifle competition.  "People don't trust them because a few years ago when Ellen DeGeneres did a similar video - not that similar, it didn't have the same format or branding - they claimed it was their format," said Jon.  A number of people have alleged the Fine Brothers have already had other video-makers' content removed from the internet.  One critic on Reddit said: "They've used their leverage with YouTube to take down channels that were making kids-react videos and seniors-react videos."  Addressing the issue, Benny Fine said: "When you create series and products, sometimes there's specific situations where your content is being infringed... in very rare cases somebody produces a beat-by-beat version of your exact series, which has happened to us."  Asked on Facebook whether people would be prevented from making a video called, for example, "Kids react to Red Bull", the Fine Brothers replied: "That is a trademarked show name, so yes, that is correct."  But clarifying their licensing plan, on Facebook, the Fine Brothers posted: "We are in no way claiming reaction content in general is our intellectual property.  "We are not going after/shutting down/suing anyone who makes reaction-based content," they wrote.  Ryan Morrison, a video gamer turned lawyer, has expressed his disapproval of the Fine Brothers' scheme.  He posted on his website: "If you make reaction videos, which a lot of YouTubers do, you are potentially in a lot of trouble."  He has now offered to help video-makers fight the Fine Brothers' trademark application.  "The public has 30 days to file an opposition," he said.  "Had the Fine Bros kept quiet for another month, they almost certainly would have gotten this trademark, as no-one seemed to notice it.  "Instead, they announced their ridiculous licensing program and turned all eyes on them."  Since their announcement on Tuesday, the Fine Brothers have lost more than 170,000 followers from their YouTube channel.  "I can't remember a channel that lost so many subscribers this quickly. At one point they were losing 10,000 an hour," said Jon.  "The Fine Brothers have become the convenient face of many people's frustrations.  A lot of people don't like how YouTube's content takedown system works and that it treats you are guilty until proven innocent.  "That has helped this become the perfect storm of anger."  The BBC has approached the Fine Brothers for comment.	tech

The move mirrors an update by Apple in September that allowed ad-blockers to be installed as extensions for the Safari browser.  Blockers on Samsung phones will have to be added in the same way and will not come as standard.  The new browser has begun rolling out for Android Lollipop or higher users.  Popular ad-blockers, Adblock Fast and Crystal, have already been made available for Samsung phones.  As well as making web pages less cluttered, ad-blockers often improve browsers' performance - and reduce the draw on phone batteries and data plans.  "Those who use ad-blockers will likely use other browsers than the default one," said advertising industry analyst Daniel Knapp at IHS.  "It's nonetheless important for Samsung to jump on the ad-blocking bandwagon."  "It wants to show customers that it is a premium brand that protects them as well as Apple."  Mr Knapp also told the BBC there had been a "seismic change" in the ad industry, in which marketing budgets were increasingly being moved from traditional forms of advertising to, for example, sponsorship deals.  He said it was those most highly prized by advertisers, young and affluent users, who were more likely to use ad-blockers in the first place.  "I think it's an expression of massive consumer dissatisfaction with the way the ad industry works," he said.  Ad-blockers work by removing scripts in web page code that would otherwise pull content from ad networks' servers.  In November, 18% of British adults online were using some form of ad-blocker, up 3% from June, according to a report from the Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB).  Meanwhile, in Facebook's annual financial filing, the social network announced advertising earnings of $5.64bn (£3.9bn) for the fourth quarter of 2015 but warned ad-blockers could "adversely affect" future profits.  "If such technologies continue to proliferate, in particular with respect to mobile platforms, our future financial results may be harmed," it said.  But Mr Knapp said companies such as Facebook were less likely than other content publishers to be affected by mobile web ad-blockers because ads could still be delivered via their third-party apps.  "Think of ad-blockers being admitted to iOS 9," he said.  "They were all exclusively focused on the in-browser environment - not for third-party apps like Facebook."	tech

It says the most popular sites are attracting upwards of eight million visits per month.  Like many free services, the pirate sites rely on advertising.  But with few reputable brands willing to attach their name to illegal distribution, the sites turn to malicious ads to pull in profits.  Of the thousands of streams studied, the researchers said that as many as half planted malicious software on the users' machine through forced ads and other deceptive techniques.  The researchers examined how the sites are run and from where.  As well as pop-up and overlay advertising, they observed an increase in sites demanding users install browser plug-ins in order to watch a free stream.  They said that meant not only were malicious ads appearing on the football sites, but the software was also hijacking normally safe websites.  "[To watch the stream] you have to install the extension, and once the user installs the extensions, it can infect any website the user is visiting," lead researcher Zubair Rafique told the BBC.  "So, if a person installs an extension to watch a stream, and then visits a site like BBC.com, this extension can actually change the contents of BBC.com and include malicious links.  The study analysed over 5,000 aggregator domains - that is, sites which collate free streams for visitors to browse and watch.  In addition to the aggregation sites, it looked at the vast networks of media providers - the services that provide the actual video.  Because of that separation between the aggregator sites and media streaming services, it's difficult for authorities to effectively stamp out football piracy.  Though several aggregator sites have been shut down, the video streams are quickly moved to a different site, and the cycle continues. Aggregator sites will usually offer several different streams for the same match.  "We discovered that nearly 25% of live streams originate from the servers hosted in Belize," the study noted.  "More than 60% of analyzed streams originate from the media servers provided by only five companies located in Belize, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada.  "Additionally, we found that more than 64% of parties providing these streams have been reported at least once for violating the copyrights of content owners.  "Since only a handful of channel providers are responsible for broadcasting the majority of the live streams, we argue that a strict control on the operations of these entities, can effectively minimise the volume of illegal live streaming."  But how to force that strict control?  There are plenty of web hosts willing to, for the right price, offer speedy and protected server space for almost any kind of online operation.  Koddos is one hosting company cited by the study.  Its website states: "Main rules being no child porn, malicious scripts/pages or spam on the network, almost all other content is allowed.  "Abuse and DMCA messages will be forwarded to the client for resolution but in most cases action is not required."  DMCA - the Digital Millennium Copyright Act - is the mechanism by which companies and individuals can call for content they own to be taken down. In this case, it's a live football match.  After being approached by the BBC, Koddos said it complied with any request from the relevant authorities, adding: "We respond to such requests only when a court order is provided as we are not able without it to define if our customer is respecting laws or it is illegal.  "We are not the judge, just a provider for legal services."  In the UK, several internet service providers have been told by the courts that they must block certain websites. It makes it much more difficult for web users to reach those specific sites, but does little to stop others appearing elsewhere.  Of course, football is not the only type of entertainment to be exploited by pirates.  The music, movie and software industries were the first to feel the disruptive effects of file-sharing, and in time have fought to provide better legal options for accessing the content they offer.  While a "Spotify for football" may be an ideal solution, it's unlikely any company that currently broadcasts football would be keen to undercut its lucrative TV subscription business.  Between BT Sport and Sky, £5.1bn is being spent to own rights to Premier League football for the next few seasons.  In an effort to be flexible, and an acknowledgement that people want to watch sport away from their sofas, Sky Sports launched Now TV, which allows online access.  But at £6.99 for a day pass, it's unlikely to tempt certain types of people away from pirated sources. Even if, as this study suggests, it comes with significant risk.

Angela Eagle told The Sunday Times the plan to ban such firms from paying dividends was "not a runner".  The idea was criticised as "silly" by Labour economic adviser David Blanchflower, in the New Statesman.  Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the criticisms would be taken on board in the party's policy review.  Mr Corbyn floated the idea of banning profitable firms who "depend on cheap labour for those profits" from paying dividends to shareholders in a speech earlier this month.  Ms Eagle, who heads Labour's National Policy Forum, said companies should be encouraged to act more fairly, but "a ban on dividends is not the way to do it".  She told The Sunday Times: "It is an interesting idea, but it does not actually work."  Asked to respond to her comments on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Mr McDonnell said "that's why it's open for discussion".  The government is set to increase the current minimum wage, which rose to £6.70 an hour last year, to a £9 an hour for over 25s by the end of the decade.  It will be rebranded as a National Living Wage, but Labour argues it will still be below the level full time workers need to afford a decent standard of living.  Mr McDonnell said he planned to bring in a legally enforceable "real living wage" when Labour came to power.  "But in the meantime, we want to campaign with shareholders so that they pressurise their companies to abide by a real living wage and I think there is an alliance to be built there," he added.  Responding to criticism from David Blanchflower, who is a member of Labour's economic advisory panel, Mr McDonnell said "we will listen to his advice and take it on board".  Mr Blanchflower said the new Labour leadership had to "learn fast" about the realities of capitalism and stop suggesting "silly stuff" such as the dividends ban.  In a separate development, Lord Mandelson has accused Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters of declaring war on "decent Labour party members" who do not share their values.  He denied there was a civil war going on in the Labour Party but said many of those who back Mr Corbyn are now wondering if he is up to the job.  The former minister, who served in government under two Labour prime ministers said he thinks Jeremy Corbyn is "unsupportable" by the public, and is failing to put "fear" into the Conservatives.  Speaking to BBC South West, he said: "People sense that we just don't have credible policies and certainly not a leader they'd like to see as prime minister.  "And certainly if we fight the election in 2020 as we are now then my fear would be that we would face a very disappointing result.  "But there's time to go between now and then. And time for the party to make up his mind what it wants to do."  He added: "For Jeremy Corbyn and his supporters to turn around and say for people who disagree with them, that they are just Tories, that's not just insulting, that is actually very divisive, and a declaration of war by them on many decent Labour party members who share Labour party values."	politics

The details of Mr McDonnell's earnings and tax, which amounted to £61,575 and £14,253 respectively, were published in the Sunday Mirror.  His disclosure comes amid a row over a government deal for Google to pay £130m in tax dating back to 2005.  Despite criticism, Mr Osborne has said the agreement is a "major success".  But Mr McDonnell said "we can't tell" whether it was a success " because we haven't got the information".  "I want the information on how this deal was arrived at and I want them in future to be able to publish the tax records," he told the BBC's Sunday Politics.  He called for an international action to prevent companies "shopping around the world to find the lowest tax regimes and then inventing their company structures to enable that to happen".  But he added "the reputational damage to Google, I think, is immense," and he suggested the "saving they have made in tax is not worth the reputation damage they have had".  In the Sunday Mirror, Mr McDonnell wrote that the government's deal with Google had "created a lack of confidence" in the tax system.  He said taxpayers filling in their returns, due by midnight, would be "feeling angry".  He wrote: "The chancellor, the politician with sole responsibility for setting taxation, should be open and transparent about their own income.  "That is why in the spirit of the 'new politics' I have taken the decision to publish my personal tax returns.  "And I will do so every year while I seek to be and hopefully one day become chancellor.  "I think it is only fair that politicians set a good example."  Mr McDonnell has also written to Mr Osborne asking for more details of the tax deal with Google.  In the letter, he wrote: "As you will be well aware, many are concerned about the outcome and, indeed, the process by which the decision was made."  He wants to know whether Google has paid the Diverted Profits Tax, which is designed to discourage large companies diverting profits out of the UK to avoid tax, and the basis for the deal.  Earlier this week, the European Commission said it was considering how to respond to a letter of complaint from the SNP about Google's tax deal with the UK.  Google agreed to pay £130m of tax to HMRC, which said it was the "full tax due in law".  Prime Minister David Cameron defended the deal, saying the Conservatives had done more than any other government.  But European MPs have described it as a "very bad deal", and Labour said it amounted to a 3% tax rate.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35448203	Facebook and Instagram ban private gun adverts	Private individuals will no longer be allowed to advertise guns on Facebook and Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook.  Facebook had already banned the sale of guns without ID checks, but the new rules aim to stop all gun trade between individuals on the sites.  Businesses can still advertise guns on Facebook and Instagram.  The move comes three weeks after US President Barack Obama unveiled new restrictions on gun purchases.  Mr Obama's executive actions included background checks for all gun sellers and the need for states to provide information on people disqualified from buying guns due to mental illness or domestic violence.  The rule change brings gun sales under the same restrictions placed on illegal drugs and pharmaceuticals by Facebook, that has 1.59bn users worldwide.  Why Obama is powerless - the roadblock at Congress  Are you mad or criminal? - the question a gun seller asks  Texas women and their firearms - a photographer taught to shoot at an early age  Do tighter gun laws work? - a state where guns are a way of life  Guns at home - the question parents hate to ask before a playdate  Facebook "was unfortunately and unwittingly serving as an online platform for dangerous people to get guns," Shannon Watts, of the Everytown for Gun Safety campaign group, told Associated Press.  The group said it had found evidence that, in two cases, guns had been bought on the site and used to kill others.  Everytown for Gun Safety was one of a number of groups that had called on Facebook to change its policy.  The National Rifle Association (NRA), which opposes changes to gun legislation, has not yet responded to Facebook's decision.  In 2014, the NRA said previous moves by the network to limit gun advertising were insignificant.  In late 2013, New York's attorney general, Eric T Schneiderman, wrote to Facebook, alerting them to "a number of groups in which users promoted the sale of assault rifles, handguns, rifles, shotguns and gun parts."  Several hours after Facebook's announcement on Friday, dozens of groups on the site advertising private gun sales remained live.  Some users writing on the groups' walls suggested starting new groups under inconspicuous names to avoid detection.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35293178	Is Bernie Sanders the American Jeremy Corbyn?	He is the veteran socialist that no one gave a prayer to - but now Bernie Sanders is starting to be seen as a serious contender to be the Democrats' presidential candidate. Does that remind you of anyone?  A self-declared "democratic socialist" - a rare beast indeed in American politics - the 74-year-old Vermont senator has stunned the Democrat establishment by emerging from nowhere to challenge Hillary Clinton to be the party's candidate for the White House in November's general election.  He has to win the Democratic nomination before he can think about winning the White House.  The polls suggest he is in with a chance of victory in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, the first stage in the marathon process by which American parties select their presidential candidates. And he is ahead in the polls in the next primary, eight days later in New Hampshire. But Hillary Clinton, the establishment candidate, retains a comfortable lead in national polls of Democrat supporters, and most pundits think that when the contest heads into the larger states, the Sanders campaign will falter. It would be hard to see how a rank outsider, with no track record in government, could actually win this thing.  The comparisons are irresistible. They are both silver-haired socialists who rail against inequality and the political establishment - and make the style police despair. Few outside of politics had heard of them this time last year. Both men were reluctant to enter their respective contests and did not think they stood a chance of winning, but thought it might give a voice to the Left, as Sanders confessed to Politico in March.  "There are obvious connections between the Bernie and Jeremy candidacies," said Larry Sanders, Bernie's older brother, a Green Party activist who lives in Oxfordshire, when he spoke to the BBC's Esther Webber last summer. "They support similar policies; their central theme is the reversal of the redistribution of wealth and income from the majority to the very richest people."  Sanders is a famously grouchy, old school Noo Yawker. The Washington Post described him as a "member of the 'get off my lawn' caucus" in a piece entitled Seven Ways Bernie Sanders Reminds us of our grumpy grandpa. Jeremy Corbyn is every bit as earnest as Sanders, with no time for "personality politics", but he comes across as a more mild-mannered individual. More geography teacher than angry cab driver.  Like Corbyn in last summer's Labour contest, Sanders makes a point of avoiding personal attacks saying he wants to concentrate on the issues. They both cut their campaigning teeth in the anti-war movements. Sanders has more experience of running things than Corbyn, having served three terms as the independent mayor of Burlington, a small city in liberal Vermont, in the 1980s, before becoming the first Independent to be elected to the US House of Representatives in 40 years. Corbyn had never sought office of any kind before, other than his seat in Parliament, but unlike Sanders he has always been a party man.  "I have to admit, I'm not the hippest guy around," Sanders told CNN this week. But for his thousands of young supporters at rallies and on social media that may be the point. The Millennials, as the generation who came of age after the 2008 financial crash are known, are disillusioned with politics as it is currently practiced and for many, it seems, Sanders offers something radically different and appealing. Jeremy Corbyn tapped into a similar feeling last year among young left-wingers in the UK, and like Sanders, ran a highly effective social media campaign. Corbyn supporters rallied round the twitter hashtag #JezWeCan. Sanders fans have got #FeelTheBern.  "At a time of mass income and wealth inequality throughout the world, I am delighted to see that the British Labour Party has elected Jeremy Corbyn as its new leader," Sanders told the Huffington Post in September last year. "We need leadership in every country in the world which tells the billionaire class that they cannot have it all."  Asked in September last year, before he had won the Labour leadership, whether he disliked America, given his attacks on US foreign policy, Mr Corbyn told the BBC: "Absolutely not. I have been there many times and I have many friends in the USA and, indeed, I am following Bernie Sanders' campaign with great interest and, indeed, we are exchanging leaflets and badges and things like that. It's great."  The most common criticism of Sanders is that he is "extreme" and "unelectable". "How about this guy - this socialist Bernie Sanders? This guy's a total whack job," said Republican frontrunner Donald Trump at a rally last month. He has also been accused by main Democratic opponent Hilary Clinton of "flip-flopping" on gun control, something he firmly denies. Some of this will sound familiar to Jeremy Corbyn (apart from the gun control issue, of course).  Sanders describes himself as a socialist - seen as a pretty daring thing to do in a country where the term is usually an insult. But he has been careful to distance himself from Marxism or, indeed, communism, saying: "I don't believe government should own the means of production". Corbyn comes from a different left-wing tradition, where such ideas are standard. They share a commitment to tackling inequality through higher taxes on the wealthy. But Sanders' call for universal healthcare, a higher minimum wage and subsidised higher education are hardly radical by British standards. Sanders has expressed doubt over the need for America to have thousands of new nuclear warheads but, unlike Corbyn, he is no unilateralist. That really would be political suicide for a would-be American president and Commander in Chief.  With Donald Trump surging in the Republican polls, it is clearly a great time to be a maverick in American politics. The Clinton/Blair era of safe, "centre ground" politics appears to be over on both sides of the Atlantic. But it is dangerous to make too many comparisons between Sanders and Corbyn. Labour's seemingly endless leadership contest was a stroll in the park compared with the gruelling war of attrition that is the US primary season. Corbyn only had to win one election - Sanders has to keep on winning and that will be tough. But unlike his British counterpart he will, at least, be guaranteed a shot at leading his party into a general election straight away, if he succeeds. Corbyn has another four years to go.	politics

Thousands of customers currently paying £17 a month for unlimited data and calls have been told they will be moved onto a new £30 tariff if they do not opt out within 30 days.  The company has notified customers by post and said it would also text them.  Three said the more expensive plan was the closest remaining deal offering unlimited calls and data.  It stopped offering the £17 monthly deal to new customers in 2014 and said it was phasing out "legacy" tariffs, but the BBC understands hundreds of thousands of customers still use the tariff and will be affected by the switch.  One mobile industry analyst told the BBC the demise of unlimited data plans was "inevitable".  "Consumer data usage is growing exponentially," said Ben Wood from CCS Insight.  "The networks are seeing huge growth in data consumption as people watch more video content at ever-higher resolutions on their smartphones. At some point certain all-you-can-eat tariffs become uneconomical."  While the network does still offer plans with unlimited data and calls, Three says its average account holder consumes just 4.9 gigabytes of data per month.  The firm had 8.8 million customers in 2015, according to its website.  Some have posted their anger at the tariff change online, ironically tagging their posts #MakeItRight - the hashtag Three uses in its advertising campaign.  "That's how you lose brand loyalty," tweeted software engineer Joseph Longden.  "Stop forcing loyal customers like myself into new plans which are almost double the price," wrote Nathan McLean.  In a statement, Three said: "In March 2014, we introduced new price plans giving customers more options in the size of their data and voice bundles, as well as limits and alerts to prevent bill shock.  "We have a lot of tariffs that we no longer sell and moving customers to one of the new plans will ensure they can enjoy the benefits of these plans."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35444244	Week ahead	It's probably a bit early to be talking about a zombie Parliament, but the coming Westminster week, with a surfeit of uncontroversial legislation, Opposition Days and Backbench debates, does recall the dog days of the last Parliament.  Of course the agenda can be livened-up, at short notice, by ministerial statements or urgent questions, and there are a number of very big issues coming down the track (the date of the EU referendum, the mammoth Investigatory Powers Bill, the Trident vote) but the current quiet in Westminster leaves plenty of time for leadership speculation and euro-plotting.  Here's my rundown of the week's events:  The Commons opens at 2.30pm, with Work and Pensions questions, after which any post-weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will be taken.  The day's main legislating is the second reading of the Bank of England and Financial Services Bill - this deals with the governance, transparency and accountability of the Bank of England, as well as updating resolution planning and crisis management arrangements between the Bank and the Treasury.  It extends the senior managers and certification regime across the whole financial services industry and it extends the scope of the Pension Wise guidance service.  Of all the scheduled events this week (there's no accounting for urgent questions or statements) the backbench debate on the future of the Financial Conduct Authority looks the most interesting; a cross party team of Guto Bebb (Conservative), John Mann (Labour) and Kirsten Oswald (SNP) has put down a motion of no confidence in the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, saying it is not fit for purpose.  This is a pretty unprecedented move - I'm told the Commons clerks have been searching for a precedent without reward - I wonder if they've got back to the Honourable East India Company yet. It was sparked by the FCA's handling of a number of controversies, over interest rate swaps, and the management of the Connaught Income Fund (nearly 50 MPs - an impressive number - attended a recent adjournment debate on that issue) but most of all because the FCA has dropped plans for an inquiry into the culture of the financial services industry, a decision which has alarmed a number of MPs.  In Westminster Hall (from 4.30pm) MPs debate e-petition 110776 on transitional state pension arrangements for women born in the 1950s: "The government must make fair transitional arrangements for all women born on or after 6th April 1951 who have unfairly borne the burden of the increase to the State Pension Age (SPA). Hundreds of thousands of women have had significant changes imposed on them with a lack of appropriate notification." Helen Jones, the chair of the Petitions Committee, will lead the debate.  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) there's more committee stage debate on the Immigration Bill, where the key issues include immigration detention, "deport first appeal later", migrant support, and family reunion. The dinner break business is a short debate on the effects of neglected tropical diseases in impairing social and economic development in developing countries.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Business, Innovation and Skills questions, and that's followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Lib Dem former Scottish secretary, Alistair Carmichael. His Mobile Telecommunications Network Coverage (Contractual Obligations) Bill aims to strengthen the rights of consumers who purchase mobile phone contracts which do not provide the advertised service; they're promised four bars of signal in his Orkney and Shetland constituency and get none.  After that, MPs have their first debate on the Enterprise Bill - which creates a Small Business Commissioner, to deal with late payment of bills. An estimated £27bn is owed to small and medium-sized businesses. The bill also has measures dealing with deregulation and apprenticeships.  In Westminster Hall the day's debates include regional airports and UK airports capacity (9.30am-11am) and gender pricing (4.30-5.30pm).  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) there will be ping-pong on two bills from the Commons: the Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill - where no vote is expected, but key issues are housing and the Charity Commission. Then peers turn to ping-pong on the Childcare Bill - Labour is working on getting into scope a report on the effectiveness of the government's childcare proposals - and they may force that issue to a vote.  Then peers turn to an important statutory instrument: the Feed-in Tariffs (Amendment) Order, a measure which effectively cuts the subsidies to various forms of green energy; there's a Labour regret motion and a Lib Dem fatal motion, which Labour will abstain on.  The Commons opens at 11.30am, with International Development questions, followed, at noon by Prime Minister's Question Time - first in the batting order is Labour awkward squaddie John Mann, one of those behind Monday's debate on the FCA; anyone care to bet against him raising the issue with the PM?  PMQs is followed by a Ten Minute Rule Bill on Automatic Electoral Registration, from the Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh, to ensure the accuracy of electoral registers. The bill proposes to automatically register everyone accessing a public service (that is everyone who applies for a driving license, everyone who has a National Insurance number, or receives a benefit), thereby making it much easier to keep an accurate and complete register.  She quotes estimates that the government's new system of Individual Voter Registration will lead to one million voters falling off the electoral register: the bill proposes to reverse this trend.  The day's main debates are on Labour motions on tax avoidance and multinational companies - and then on public finances in Scotland. And that's followed by an adjournment debate on child dental health, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford. Tooth decay is one of the main reasons young children arrive at A&E, and the House's resident dentist will explore the issue.  In Westminster Hall, the day's debates include: fuel poverty (9.30am- 11am); Bryan Evans and the Serious Fraud Office (11am- 11.30am); and government investment in cycling (4.30 -5.30pm).  My eye was caught by the debate on changes to the level of local government funding (2.30pm - 4pm). Former Labour leadership contender Liz Kendall will open a general debate, designed to encourage as many MPs as possible to raise their particular concerns about the future of local government in an era of austerity.  In the Lords, the main business is the continuation of detailed committee stage consideration of the Immigration Bill, where peers will be looking at the issues of unaccompanied refugee children, border security and language requirements for public sector workers. During the dinner break, the House will consider a Lib Dem regret motion on the Housing benefit, abolition of the Family Premium and Date of Claim Regulations. It's not expected to be pushed to a vote.  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs questions; then mini-question times for the MPs who speak for the Church Commissioners, the Public Accounts Commission and Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission. After the weekly Commons Business statement from the Leader of the House, the rest of the day is devoted to debates chosen by the Backbench Business Committee.  First is a select committee statement from Bernard Jenkin, the chair of the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee, on the committee's report The collapse of Kids Company: lessons for charity trustees, professional firms, the Charity Commission, and Whitehall.  Then comes debates on Parliamentary sovereignty and EU renegotiations and conflict in Yemen. On the first of those, the debate was applied for by the Conservative John Baron who believes the prime minister has not made a restoration of UK Parliamentary sovereignty a priority in his EU renegotiation.  "Without the restoration of sovereignty, everything else is peripheral," Mr Baron said. "We should by ourselves be able to stop unwanted directives, taxes and regulation. I look forward to the Government's response in the debate, given many of us have been unsuccessful in engaging with the Prime Minister."  The adjournment debate is on the Delay Repay scheme for rail commuters - led by the Lib Dem, Tom Brake.  The Westminster Hall debate (1.30pm) is on the role of men in preventing violence against women.  In the Lords, business in the Chamber begins at 11am - and the main event is the third reading of the Education and Adoption Bill - the key issue outstanding is the new regional schools commissioners created under the Bill.  Labour peer and human rights lawyer Helena Kennedy then leads debates on both the EU Committee's report Subsidiarity Assessment: Reform of the electoral law of the EU and on a reasoned opinion on the European Parliament's proposed decision on the election of MEPs. The final business in the Chamber is a debate on the EU Committee's report on Capital Markets Union: a welcome start.  It's another private members' bill day in the Commons (from 9.30am) opening with detailed consideration of the Conservative Mike Wood's Riot Compensation Bill, and then William Wragg's Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill.  If those are completed (and there seems to be a consistent pattern of padding out these report stage debates) there might be a little time left to allow a mini-second reading debate on Peter Bone's Ovarian Cancer (Information) Bill, but I doubt Christopher Chope's Bat Habitats Regulation Bill will be reached.  One other Friday trend to watch out for is for the granting of urgent questions, which used to be quite a rarity on Fridays, when the Commons tends to be thinly-attended.  The Speaker's Office always insists that these are decided on merit, but I can't help wondering if some kind of message is being sent, about the increasing tendency to slip policy announcements out on a Thursday, when they might not be noticed by departing MPs.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35441445	Facebook's decision to close Parse angers developers	Facebook is to close its mobile app development platform Parse, to the disappointment of many developers.  Parse is a toolkit for creating and running mobile apps.  Facebook acquired the cloud-based service in 2013 for a reported $85m (£59m). At the time it claimed to power "tens of thousands" of mobile apps.  Co-founder Kevin Lacker said in a blog post that it would be wound down over the next 12 months, so the company could focus resources elsewhere.  The firm has already made its server open source and is also offering a database migration tool to help people switch to alternatives.  "We're proud that we've been able to help so many of you build great mobile apps," wrote Mr Lacker. "We know that many of you have come to rely on Parse, and we are striving to make this transition as straightforward as possible."  The New York Times reports that travel website Expedia and productivity app Quip are among its customers.  One developer tweeted that the move was "disingenuous" and that he felt the developer community had been "misled".  "Parse is [the] perfect counterargument to build-n-flip Silicon Valley. Only losers are the thousands (millions?) of users," tweeted Dan Frommer, tech editor of Quartz.  At the time of its acquisition by Facebook, co-founder Ilyar Sukhar reassured users that Parse was "not going away".  "It's going to get better," he wrote. "We are excited about the future of Parse".	tech

Here's what's in today's very playful show.  This week we visited the London Toy Fair which has become a great place to spot how tech trends are reflected in the world of play. We found that traditional toymakers are finding ways of grabbing children's attention back from the touch screen devices they all now have. So the best toys combine the physical with the digital - in the latest version of the Scalextric car-racing game a tablet controls the race and tells drivers when to come into the pits. Then there is a toy called Stikbot which, combined with a free app, encourages children to make stop motion animations.  Still with toys, or rather games, this week saw a computer program beat a champion player at Go. The 2,500-year-old game has simple rules but presents a fiendishly complex challenge for the AI researchers who have been racing to create a program to play it at a professional level. Just hours after Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg wrote about his firm's efforts to tackle the problem, Google's DeepMind trumped that with the news that its AlphaGo program had beaten the European Go champion five games in a row. We have an interview with DeepMind's founder Demis Hassabis.  The streaming video service Netflix is expanding worldwide, so can any local content provider compete? Jason Njoku, founder of Nigeria's iROKOtv, certainly thinks he has a chance with a service which offers Nollywood movies and TV programmes. He tells us why expat Nigerians and a domestic audience is eager to get access via their mobile phones to high quality content. Like Netflix, iROKO is now investing in creating as well as distributing content and Mr Njoku has just persuaded investors including Canal Plus to back this venture.  Apple delivered another quarter of record profits, but the revelation that iPhone sales look certain to suffer their first decline over the next three months, sent its shares tumbling. The mobile phone industry guru Ian Fogg of IHS Consulting tells us that even if the market is disappointed, Apple is still making huge profits from every phone. He says the firm now faces an interesting choice - keep prices sky-high to boost profits further, or nudge sales higher with more affordable phones.  Tune in to the BBC World Service at 15:00 GMT for all that and more or catch the podcast later.	tech

Naveed Ahmed, 27, of Tampa, US, wrote a programme that helped a group of scammers bombard mobile phones with unsolicited text messages.  Recipients were told they had won gift cards for an electrical retailer that could be claimed by visiting a website.  He was sentenced to two years probation and can continue to work with computers monitored by probation officers.  Contact information harvested by the scam was submitted to Internet Cost Per Action networks, which are companies that gather personal information and pay for submissions.  ICPA networks are legal - but the way Ahmed and his group obtained the details they submitted was not, said Assistant US Attorney Jimmy Kitchen.  Ahmed is thought to have earned more than $2,000 (£1,400) a week between September 2011 and February 2013 by taking part in the scam, according to the Associated Press.  It is believed the money raised was channelled though a Swiss bank account controlled by a so far unidentified co-conspirator.  Ahmed was one of 12 people charged for advertising their computer skills for illegal use on a cybercriminal marketplace which was shut down by the FBI in July.  Ahmed told the judge: "I know my actions were irresponsible... I had this naive, immature view of being invincible."  Defence lawyer Melvin Vatz said Ahmed was "a man of considerable intelligence" who had "succumbed to directing those talents in the wrong way".	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35432687	London's first driverless cars based on Heathrow 'pods'	The first driverless cars to be tested on the streets of London will resemble the electric passenger shuttles currently in use at Heathrow Airport.  The group behind the project is currently adapting the pods for use on the roads.  It has yet to unveil the exact design but confirmed that the adapted vehicles will not run on dedicated tracks.  Greenwich is one of four places in the UK where driverless pods and public reaction to them are being tested.  Trials will also take place in Bristol, Coventry and Milton Keynes. The £8m project is jointly funded by government agency Innovate UK and industry.  The Greenwich Automated Transport Environment project - or Gateway - will see seven driverless pods tested on the pavements around the Greenwich Peninsula, where the O2 Arena is based, from July.  Routes are still being worked out but are likely to include residential areas, the North Greenwich underground station and businesses around the arena.  The so-called UltraPODs currently in service at Heathrow carry passengers between the car park and Terminal 5. In the five years they have been in use, they have carried 1.5 million passengers and travelled 1.8 million miles (three million kilometres).  Westfield Sportscars, a British carmaker, will be responsible for manufacturing and testing of the pods. Heathrow Enterprise will design the software while a third British firm, Oxbotica, will provide mapping and other sensors to ensure the vehicles are safe.  The pods will have three months of testing, first with invited users and then with the general public. Each pod can carry six passengers but will require a steward to be present at all times to press the emergency button in the case of a problem.  The trial of the pods will reveal a wealth of data, Prof Nick Reed, technical director for the Gateway project, told the BBC.  "It will tell us whether people trust and accept these vehicles and how they would work as part of the urban landscape," he said.  "This vehicle has millions of miles under its belt and now we have to take it outside of the track and modify it for use on pavements."  The pods will differ from an earlier demonstration where a shuttle designed by autonomous vehicle firm Phoenix Wings was on display.  "That was perfect for the demonstration and we did consider using it but we had a procurement process and chose the design we have now," Prof Nick Reed said.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35412676	Proposed change to law on possession of wild bird eggs	The UK and Welsh governments are backing a change to the law on the possession of wild bird eggs.  They say anyone able to prove their eggs were taken from the wild before 1981 should not be prosecuted.  The law was changed in 2004 to require a licence and proof eggs were taken before 1954 but this was ruled unlawful because of a lack of consultation.  Ministers say reinstating the so-called "pre-1981 defence" against liability would be a proportionate step.  Officials said "clarifying" the law in England and Wales would have the effect of focusing resources on prosecuting those currently collecting and trading eggs rather than punishing people who have built up or inherited historical collections.  The move, it is hoped, will encourage those with collections of scientific value to hand them over to museums for research.  While the practice of collecting wild bird eggs is in decline, the two governments' joint consultation found that illegal activity was still going on and there was a need for legislation outlawing it - which first came into force in 1981 - to remain on the statute book.  The majority of those who responded to a consultation carried out by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs called for the so-called pre-1981 defence - which takes its name from the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act - to be reinstated.  When the Act was passed, it was specified that no-one would be prosecuted who could establish that their eggs were taken from the wild before the legislation came into force.  However, this was superseded in 2004 when the law was changed to make eggs taken after the passage of the 1954 Protection of Birds Act the "burden of proof" for criminal liability.  Critics of the move argue this has had the effect of retrospectively criminalising anyone who collected bird eggs legally between 1954 and 1981.  The regulations were approved by Parliament in 2004 via a statutory instrument, without a full debate, and were designed to bring the UK into line with an EU directive on the definition of wild birds.  But they were later deemed unlawful because the public had not been properly consulted on the issue of removing the pre-1981 exemption.  In a high-profile case, John Dodsworth's 2009 conviction for the illegal possession of nearly 1,000 wild bird eggs was quashed by the High Court in 2012 on the grounds that the 1981 pre-defence had been "effectively removed without consultation".  Lawyers for Mr Dodsworth, who had previous convictions for wildlife offences, argued he could not have known he was breaking the law by being in possession of a collection of eggs assembled by others over decades and given to him before 2004.  They also warned the law as it stood had major implications for museums and other holders of potentially valuable collections.  Defra has now concluded there would be no significant benefit to wildlife conservation in maintaining the existing regulations.  By reverting to the 1981 pre-defence, the department says it would ensure the UK complied with EU laws while making it more likely valuable collections were preserved and not disposed of in a hasty fashion.  "Reinstating the pre-1981 defence is a proportionate response to, what is now, a declining activity," it said.  In reaching its decision, the UK and Welsh governments noted that there was no forensic method to authenticate the age of eggs to determine the legality of individual collections.  The RSPCA said egg collecting had been "on the wane" since tougher penalties, including the risk of jail sentences, were introduced in 2001 but still posed a serious threat.  The charity, one of 16 organisations - including police forces and museums - and 18 individuals to respond to the consultation, said the 1981 law had been full of "loopholes" and it would have preferred the 2004 regulations to stay in place as part of the "legislative armoury" against offenders.  "We are going to go back to where we were," said Guy Shorrock, the organisation's senior investigations officer. "I suspect that there will be some egg collectors who will be pretty happy with this because they think it will make their life a bit easier."  But Mr Shorrock said it was not a "huge issue" and was unlikely to have a big impact on the amount of prosecutions brought by the Crown Prosecution Service. The CPS says it weighs up all the evidence, not just dates of possession, before deciding whether to launch proceedings.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35418212	Digital safe offers solution to password thefts	A British firm that claims to have come up with a solution to the issue of bulk password theft has announced £1m in funding to launch its product.  Silicon Safe has designed a special box - a piece of hardware which stores passwords separate to the network.  Last year there were high-profile hacks at firms including TalkTalk, Ashley Madison and Vtech which exposed millions of users' passwords.  One expert questioned whether new hardware is really solving the problem.  Online identity theft is becoming one of the most common forms of cyber-attack and can leave large organisations with both financial and reputational losses.  The founders of Silicon Safe, Dr Will Harwood and Roger Gross, initially came up with the solution - dubbed Password Protect - as an academic exercise.  "We were seeing large-scale theft of passwords becoming an increasing problem and conventional security techniques were proving ineffective," Dr Harwood told the BBC.  They quickly saw that there was commercial potential in their idea.  Software is prone to bugs and flaws so their first step was to design bespoke hardware - effectively hard-coding a chip - and making sure that it did not run an operating system or any other conventional software. This design, the founders claim, makes it impenetrable via conventional attack routes.  The box is designed to be secure and has only one purpose - to store passwords. It runs on 10,000 lines of code - far less than used for a back-end database where passwords are normally stored.  There is no conventional interface with the back-end systems although it does allow web servers to send login credentials to the system in order to authenticate passwords. It does not, at any point, reveal these passwords.  Dr Harwood admits that hackers able to gain access to the back-end database of organisations could interrogate the box, but he has built in a safety feature.  "After four attempts to authenticate the password, the account will be flagged to system adminstrators," he told the BBC.  The device has been trialled by several large UK companies, including a retail bank and a telecoms firm, and is due to launch in April. Firms will pay an upfront cost of around £100,000 and will also have ongoing maintenance fees.  It is, Dr Harwood said, easy to install and use with existing infrastructure - the box can be simply inserted into existing server racks and requires a few hundred lines of new code from IT managers.  But not everyone was convinced it would be the panacea against mass password theft.  "The system assumes that we all practise proper password hygiene and don't have the same passwords for different accounts. All the evidence suggests that this isn't the case," said Prof Alan Woodward, a computer security expert from the University of Surrey.  It also might encourage laziness in the IT departments of large firms, he added.  "You want developers to know what they are doing including knowing how to store data correctly. That might be preferable to paying £100,000 for a box engineered for one specific purpose."  The Cambridge start-up remains confident in its solution and last year it launched a hacker challenge, inviting anyone to steal 100 unencrypted passwords from the system. To date, over 2.5 million attempts have been made, but none have been successful, according to the firm.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35435468	Senior Tory quits party's bullying scandal inquiry	A senior Conservative official has quit his role overseeing the inquiry into bullying within the party, following an investigation by BBC Newsnight.  Newsnight had revealed key witnesses were reluctant to give evidence while Rob Semple was part of the process.  The inquiry was set up after the suicide of activist Elliott Johnson.  Mr Johnson's parents had called for Mr Semple to step down over his links with Mark Clarke, the man at the centre of many of the bullying allegations.  Last year Mr Semple became chairman of the Tory's volunteer organisation, the National Convention, with the strong support of Mr Clarke.  On Tuesday, the parents of Mr Johnson, the 21-year-old Tory activist whose suicide last September sparked claims of unchecked bullying within the party, told the BBC that Mr Semple should remove himself from any involvement in the inquiry, which is being undertaken by the law firm Clifford Chance.  Earlier this week, Mr Semple had insisted he would not step down and was no longer in touch with Mr Clarke, but, in a statement on Thursday, he announced a U-turn.  He said: "As a father myself, the wishes of Mr and Mrs Johnson are paramount to me and, after seeing their interview on BBC TV, I have decided to recuse myself from the board meeting that will discuss the Clifford Chance report.  "As a Conservative volunteer for 20 years, I want to establish the truth of what happened to Elliott.  "I am convinced the investigation will be fair and thorough and my decision must not be regarded as my accepting any suggestion that I would be less than impartial.  "As chairman of the voluntary party, I will be pressing for the implementation of all the recommendations of the investigation."  Mr Johnson, whose son Elliott had complained of being bullied before he died, said: "This is a victory for common sense.  "Mr Semple has done the right thing, but I still have deep reservations about this whole process.  "The Conservative Party seems to want to control this process which makes people very suspicious about its motives.  "I still don't believe this is a truly independent inquiry."  Fifteen key witnesses to the bullying inquiry had told the BBC they wanted Mr Semple to stand down from any involvement in overseeing the report on the scandal.  A number of them also said they would be reluctant to talk to the Clifford Chance investigation while he was still involved.  The law firm has been commissioned to file a report that will be considered by the Conservative Party board before it is published.  Mark Clarke has always denied any wrongdoing.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35435193	John Bercow says MPs would back temporary move during Parliament repairs	Commons Speaker John Bercow has said he thinks MPs would agree to temporarily move out of Parliament while £4bn repairs are carried out.  But he said they should only agree to move if a temporary, "pop-up" Commons chamber is constructed nearby and within Parliament's security cordon.  The cordon covers a number of government buildings in Whitehall.  Otherwise, Mr Bercow said in a Q&A session, politicians could be locked out of Parliament for many years.  A parliamentary committee is finalising controversial proposals to rehouse both the Commons and the Lords for up to six years while the ageing building is thoroughly renovated.  A decision is due within months and the move could take place after the 2020 general election.  The alternative: a much slower process of repairs could take place while MPs and peers continue working in the Palace of Westminster - but this could take more than 30 years to complete and cost nearly £6bn, 50% more.  In a question and answer session with the audience after a wide-ranging informal interview at St James Theatre in central London, Mr Bercow said it was important that MPs should be persuaded to abandon the decaying Victorian Palace of Westminster while the overhaul takes place.  He thought they would agree, on one condition: "We should preserve a 'pop-up chamber' on the Parliamentary estate, so that there is an incentive for those doing the work of restoration and refurbishment to do it to time."  Possible secure sites being discussed for such a temporary debating chamber for MPs include the Richmond House headquarters of the Department of Health in Whitehall, and the medieval monolithic splendour of Westminster Hall, the oldest part of Westminster, where monarchs lie in state and the trials were held of Charles I, and Thomas More.  It is thought other options such as adapting parts of the Treasury or the Foreign Office have been ruled out. Peers would also have to abandon Westminster and a temporary House of Lords could be housed in the QE II conference centre opposite Westminster Abbey.  The Commons Speaker, Mr Bercow, explained why he thought it was necessary to build a temporary debating chamber for MPs.  "If we were simply to go, in every respect, away from the House and to preserve nothing on the Parliamentary estate, it seems to me - on the principle of the doctrine of the occupied field - the contractors are occupying the field and we could be out for a long time. "  He also described how he could still represent his constituents despite his role as a neutral Speaker by summoning a Cabinet minister to see him in Speaker's House.  They apparently have to come to him, not the other way round. And woe betide the minister who displeases the Speaker: he or she faces a summons for what Mr Bercow's private secretary describes frostily as "a meeting without coffee".	politics

The population of the camp has risen steadily in recent weeks to about 2,500, including about 250 children, according to medical volunteer group, Medecins Sans Frontieres‎ (MSF).  Youth worker Liz Clegg has been working with women and children in "the Jungle" for several months.  She first visited the region to deliver camping equipment donated by festival goers at last year's Glastonbury Festival, but ended up staying to work with unaccompanied children aged between 10 and 13.  She told BBC News why she thinks it is important that the UK offer these children sanctuary.  "I work in a centre which was built for refugees by a group of volunteers from Ireland. The 10 to 13-year-olds that I work with are wonderful but they do have serious behavioural problems.  This is where the journey ends for many - and hope ends.  Children arrive with horrendous stories, but they are still full of life when they arrive. They stay here for three months and deteriorate, as they slowly come to realise that they may never get to Britain.  They are brainwashed that getting to the UK is the only thing that matters and that on their journey to the UK they must have nothing to do with authority and not get their pictures taken.  But these are children as young as 10. They are not capable of making this decision and they have no adults to help them.  We try to dissuade them from going onto the lorries, but it rarely works. These children are out every night trying to get to Britain. They come back cold, and tired and with no one to care for them.  Earlier this week one of the children was so upset that he was howling like a dog and fainting. He has no one here.  Another child, who was really chatty when he first arrived, is now unresponsive to anyone.  Some of the children pretend they are accompanied. They say they travelled here with an uncle, but after talking to them you soon realise that the uncle is normally an adult who they met on the journey rather than a blood relation.  When they get to Calais this adult often abandons them to get on a lorry to the UK.  The youngest child I have worked with is 10-years-old. He was separated from a family member on the journey from Afghanistan.  Most of the children in this age-group seem to come from Afghanistan but I've worked with Syrians, Kurds and children from Eritrea over the past few months.  I strongly believe that if we are going to take child protection seriously then we need to look at the children in Calais, and not just the camps around Syria. Especially the young ones.  They are little and miss their families and they have no one."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35427586	US parents warned on hacked baby webcams	American parents are being warned about the dangers of hackable baby monitors.  It follows numerous reports by consumers that devices have been hacked and abuse shouted at children.  Now, New York's department of consumer affairs has launched an investigation - contacting four unnamed baby monitor companies, demanding information about their security and to see evidence of complaints about unauthorised access.  "Video monitors are intended to give parents peace of mind when they are away from their children, but the reality is quite terrifying - if they aren't secure, they can provide easy access for predators to watch and even speak to our children," said DCA commissioner Julie Menin in a statement.  "Internet-connected devices like video monitors provide convenience - but without proper safeguards, they pose serious privacy risks. We encourage parents to take steps to make sure their devices are secure and call on manufacturers to make security a top priority."  In its report, the FTC said it had looked at five baby monitors and found four of them could be accessed using easy-to-crack passwords.  In addition, two of the five did not encrypt the feed between the monitor and the home router and one did not encrypt the feed from the router to the internet.  The FTC urged parents to look for baby monitors with "strong security protocols" and to choose strong passwords.  A net-connected baby monitor sends feeds to a user's home wireless router and then over the internet so that it can be viewed remotely.  But hackers have reportedly used them to scream at children or parents or turn the devices into spy cameras.  In August, an Indiana couple said someone had hacked in to their two-year-old child's monitor to play the Police's Every Breath You Take followed by "sexual noises".  In November 2014, the public was warned about a website containing thousands of live feeds to baby monitors.	tech

The software is widely used to write programs that run in web browsers. But Oracle said modern browsers were increasingly incompatible with it.  Oracle said it would begin winding Java down with the release of its latest development kit software but its demise would not be immediate.  Java has been criticised by many online security experts, who have said it is vulnerable to hackers.  "By late 2015, many browser vendors have either removed or announced timelines for the removal of standards based plug-in support, eliminating the ability to embed Flash, Silverlight, Java and other plug-in based technologies," Oracle said, announcing the decision on Wednesday.  "With modern browser vendors working to restrict and reduce plug-in support in their products, developers of applications that rely on the Java browser plug-in need to consider alternative options such as migrating from Java Applets (which rely on a browser plug-in) to the plug-in free Java Web Start technology."  "Oracle plans to deprecate the Java browser plug-in" in the next release of its Java Development Kit, JDK 9, it said. The technology would be removed from future software releases, it added.  "By 'deprecate', Oracle doesn't mean that the Java plug-in will be killed stone dead. Instead they will increasingly hide it, and not encourage users to install it. In due course, the software will be entirely removed," said the security consultant Graham Cluley.  In a blog post for online security company Tripwire, Mr Cluley said: "Of course, Oracle isn't dropping support for Java entirely - but with the demise of the unpopular web browser plug-in, it hopes users will be happy to switch over to its replacement."  He said that, while the number of reported problems had fallen in recent years, Java remained notorious for its vulnerabilities.  "Many users have found it hard to muster... love for the technology," he said.  "And yet, the Java browser plug-in has plodded on, shrugging off the brickbats and abuse, and doggedly providing support for the odd, ageing website and bespoke applications relied upon by corporations."  Mr Cluley said browser manufacturers were making the Java plug-in irrelevant.  He added: "Oracle isn't the only company having to recognise that the world is changing. Adobe, developers of the often-attacked Flash plug-in, recently made clear that it was moving away from the platform to an HTML5-based future."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35429042	Will you like Facebook's new Reactions?	Do you ever "like" something on Facebook? If so, life is about to get a bit more complex.  The social networking giant is about to roll out something called Reactions, which will allow you to express your feelings in a more nuanced fashion.  In the conference call with analysts after Facebook's blockbuster financial results, Mark Zuckerberg confirmed that Reactions - which are being tested in Spain, Ireland and a few other places - would be shown everywhere "pretty soon".  The idea, the chief executive said, is to add "a little bit of complexity" to something that is very simple. "When you only have a like button, if you share a sad piece of content or something that makes you angry, people may not have the tool to react to it."  So now Facebook users are being given new tools in the form of emoticons labelled "love", "haha", "wow", "sad" and "angry" - or they can still just "like".  There was another button marked "yay" but that has been removed after pilot users apparently said: "Err….what??"  For more than a billion people who visit Facebook every day there may now be a tricky period of adjustment. Do I just like that picture of your dog or do I love it? Should I go as far as telling you I'm "angry" about your views on the issues of the day - or is "haha" enough?  But it's advertisers who will be really going "wow" about this change to the way Facebook works. The latest results show just how much they have bought into the social network's message that it offers a unique way to connect with consumers and learn everything about them. Now they will have a far more complex set of data.  Simon Calvert, head of strategy at the marketing agency Lida, says if the new system accurately reflects human emotions then it will be very interesting.  "Emotions travel five times faster than rational thought," he said. "So the ability to build better emotional connections with consumers is something that advertisers really prize."  Facebook "likes" have become a somewhat devalued currency, as I found out when my Virtual Bagel imaginary business collected more than 4,000 likes from all over the world.  "They're devalued because brands collect them mindlessly," Mr Calvert explains. But he sees advertisers using Reactions in a far more sophisticated way to get insights into the emotions people feel about products.  Another social media marketing expert, Kristal Ireland of Twentysixdigital, says there is always great excitement when Facebook makes a change like this. She believes there is an opportunity to learn far more about what people think of marketing messages but says the real challenge will be to make sense of the flood of new data: "You might end up with such fragmented data that you can't make up your mind what you ad should look like."  But what should we as Facebook users think about laying out our emotions for all to see?  Nick Oliver urges caution. His company People.io aims to help users take control over their social media data and realise its value to advertisers.  "From the consumer point of view they are now giving up their emotional data for advertisers to use and manipulate," he says. "People open themselves up on social media and the data is used in ways they never expect."  He argues that the rise in the use of ad blockers, which are largely ineffective on Facebook, makes this data even more valuable. "The demand for a price of people's attention is getting higher."  Of course, the big question for advertisers is just how honest people will be in expressing themselves via the Reactions buttons.  The social media era has seen millions sharing their feelings with the world - but we are quickly learning just how dangerous that can be.  Decoding the significance of Facebook love, laughter and tears will become an essential skill for anyone in the marketing industry.	tech

It has received hundreds of complaints from owners of new homes about poor broadband.  According to the Home Builders Federation, BT Openreach has failed to connect new homes on time.  In response, Openreach said it was "working hard to fix this issue".  It acknowledged that it had a backlog of new homes waiting to be connected to broadband.  "The rapid growth in the number of new homes being built around the country has resulted in some owners of new build properties having to wait longer than usual for their phone and broadband service," it said in a statement.  "Openreach would like to apologise to any affected customers and is working hard to fix this issue. We have also stated our ambition to provide infrastructure to all homes in new build developments before customers move in.  "Close liaison with developers is critical so Openreach continues to work closely with the house-building community to better plan for and deliver the capacity and infrastructure needed."  Openreach, the BT subsidiary responsible for the UK's telecoms infrastructure, is facing increasing pressure over its performance, as regulator Ofcom considers whether to separate the two companies.  In January, a group of more than 100 MPs signed a letter calling for Openreach to be split off.  The HBF offered its own response to the possible break-up of Openreach in October.  In its report, the federation said that it had "grown increasingly concerned at the persistent failure of BT Openreach to connect new build homes in a consistent and timely fashion".  "The poor performance of Openreach in connecting many new build homes to broadband services within a reasonable timeframe is now having an impact on the customer satisfaction levels obtained by the house builder," its report read.  "With broadband now seen as an essential utility it is unsurprising that customers moving into new homes with little or no connectivity feel dissatisfied even when, in some cases, house builders provide mobile broadband services in the interim."  A spokesman for the HBF told the BBC that the relationship with BT has improved in recent months.  Openreach added that it too "has made a lot of progress over the past year in improving its communication with developers".  "Improved processes such as encouraging developers to register new sites with Openreach at the beginning of the planning stage are also helping us to deliver on our commitment to bring fibre to as many new housing developments as possible," it told the BBC.  The telecoms company is expected to make an announcement on its plans to provide broadband services to new homes imminently.  Andrew Ferguson, editor of broadband news site ThinkBroadband said that often timetables between developers and BT clashed.  "Even where developers work with Openreach, the timescale from agreeing to put a cabinet for fibre and going live is around a year (based on the 20-30 private funded cabinets that have done this to date). If a developer can get Openreach on board ahead of time this can be done to coincide with the first house being sold."  He advised buyers wanting a good connection to make sure they checked that broadband was available before purchasing.  "Only when people stop buying homes with bad broadband will developers be forced to consider it with the same importance they give things like electricity and parking," he said.  Hundreds of residents who have recently purchased a new home without broadband, have contacted Cable.co.uk to express their anger.  Dan Howdle, editor-in-chief of the website, said: "It comes as a complete surprise to most new build homebuyers that their ultra-modern home not only offers broadband speeds unfit for basic everyday use, but in some cases no broadband connectivity at all."  Earlier this month Labour MP Chi Onwurah - a former telecoms engineer - said that it was "incomprehensible" that new developments are being built without access to fibre networks. She urged the government to act on the issue.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35429036	Netflix blocked by Indonesia in censorship row	Netflix has been blocked by Indonesia's biggest internet service provider, upsetting its move into the country.  The state-owned telecoms firm said it had concerns about the content Netflix was offering and accused it of failing to have a necessary business permit.  The US company announced earlier this month that it had added 130 countries, including Indonesia, to its service - taking it almost worldwide.  One expert said the setback had been "inevitable".  Telekom Indonesia said Netflix needed to work with it to ensure objectionable content was removed.  "The issue is about the permit. They don't follow the rules. They also display violence and adult content," the firm's consumer director Dian Rachmawan told the Jakarta Post newspaper.  "We must [block it] before things get more complicated and create a serious issue."  The country's government said that it was not behind the move.  "Other internet service providers are still allowing Netflix access. So, it is a pure corporate decision," said communications minister Rudiantara.  "[But] it will be difficult for Netflix. You can see for yourself on how much content there is [in Netflix] that must be censored."  Indonesia is one of Asia's most highly populated nations with about 250 million people living amongst its islands. Many of those people, however, would not have fast enough internet access to stream video.  Netflix has not disclosed how it intends to address the issue.  "Services delivered over the internet present all sorts of novel questions for policymakers," it said in a statement.  The ban is not the first problem Netflix has faced since making its surprise announcement at the CES tech trade show.  The Kenya Film Classification Board is considering a block of its own saying the platform posed a "threat to our moral values and national security" because it had not submitted it shows for local ratings.  Vietnam's government has also told the service it must obtain an official licence and have its content edited by local censors or it would be in breach of the law.  The disputes will be closely watched in China, where Netflix is still seeking permission to launch.  Private DVDs of all the latest films and television series are openly for sale in shopping malls and markets across Indonesia. They cost less than $1 (70p). There are occasional raids by the police but mostly authorities turn a blind eye.  So, the idea that the government was concerned about Netfix breaking copyright had been met with cynicism.  However, there is widespread concern in Indonesia about pornography. In 2008, the country passed a controversial anti-pornography bill and websites that the government deems not "healthy" for society are blocked and that includes the popular video clip platform Vimeo.  Indonesia has one of South East Asia's most free presses, but major television stations are controlled by powerful politicians and they are increasingly being used to further their agenda.  One of those films, the Oscar-nominated documentary The Act of Killing, is on Netfix. It focuses on the perpetrators of the mass killings of suspected communists between 1965 and 1966.  Among Indonesia's growing class in the capital Jakarta - the Twitter capital of the world - there was great excitement about Netflix entering the market.  There is now dismay at efforts to control what they can watch on it.  "This was absolutely inevitable," commented Guy Bisson from the media research firm Ampere Analysis.  "When you are considering a global launch or even a local launch you have to take into account local regulations and politics as well as local morals and customs.  "There have been many incidents in the past where what seems to be an innocuous programme in the West caused problems when shown elsewhere.  "One example was the British quiz show Fifteen to One - it went down very badly in Asia because it was considered incredibly rude how the host spoke to the contestants."  However, Mr Bisson added that this did not necessarily mean Netflix should have rolled out its service more slowly.  "You could argue it should have taken this into consideration," he said.  "But there will always be differences of opinion on local content and other teething problems."	tech

Nearly 300 backed a vote of no confidence over allegations of involvement in a no-poaching deal while he was a Google human resources boss.  Mr Geshuri was alleged to have fired an employee who violated an agreement by approaching an Apple staff member.  Wikimedia board members said Mr Geshuri did not want to be a distraction from the organisation's work.  Patricio Lorente, who chairs the board, and its vice-chair, Alice Wiegand, announced Mr Geshuri's decision to editors on Wednesday.  They wrote: "Throughout the discussion about the appointment of Arnnon Geshuri to the board of trustees, the board has carefully listened to you and discussed internally.  "Earlier today, Arnnon decided to step down from the board.  "To paraphrase his words, he doesn't want to be a distraction for the important discussions that the community and the foundation need to face in the times to come.  "We want to thank Arnnon for his ongoing commitment and for helping us to move forward.  "The board governance committee is working to improve and update our selection processes before we fill the vacancy left by Arnnon's departure.  "We are sorry for the distress and confusion this has caused to some in our community, and also to Arnnon."  Documents filed with a US court indicated Mr Geshuri, who now works for Tesla Motors, had been involved in enforcing a deal struck between Apple and Google not to poach each other's staff.  In a 2007 email, while he had been working at Google, he had assured his boss, Eric Schmidt, that a company employee would be "terminated within the hour" for approaching an Apple staff member, the documents indicated.  Mr Schmidt had contacted Mr Geshuri after Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs had complained to him, the documents indicated.  In 2015, Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe all agreed to settle a legal action over related claims for $415m (£289m).  Mr Geshuri has not responded to a request for comment.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35426092	Keeping football tough but safe by spotting concussion	Many sports are dangerous, but few are dangerous by design.  For years the powers-that-be behind American Football tried to hide it, but it became too serious. The more it was studied, the taller the pile of evidence became.  To succeed in a game where brute force is part of the DNA, you must throw in all your body can manage. And for decades of American Football, that meant your head too.  Now researchers have discovered that long-term head injuries among professional American Footballers are not just possible, they are probable.  A 2015 study looked at brains belonging to deceased ex-NFL players who had agreed to be part of the study before they died. They found a pattern: of the 91 brains examined, 87 of them showed the players suffered from the same condition.  It is Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, CTE, and it is a condition brought on by regular trauma to the head, a regular occurrence for players at every level of American Football, not just the big leagues. It can lead to dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  The study was the latest piece of unpleasant reading for the NFL who, fearing what it could mean for the future of the sport, initially did what it could to avoid the subject.  It was Dr Bennett Omalu - a Nigerian forensic pathologist - who pioneered research, putting two and two together to work out what was going on.  He was examining former Pittsburgh Steelers player Mike Webster, who had died suddenly, in 2002.  It took the NFL seven years to publicly acknowledge what Dr Omalu had found that day.  The battle to have the findings acknowledged by the NFL - and indeed, the American people - has been immortalised in Concussion, a new film starring Will Smith.  Dr Omalu's research meant families now had evidence to back up what they had long feared - that the sport had prematurely taken their loved ones.  The lawsuits began. How much did the teams know? Why did they not act? Who should be held responsible?  Millions of dollars, per affected player, were won. Thanks to the court rulings, concussion in football had rapidly became more than an ethical issue - it was a financial one too.  Finally, the NFL began to listen. Sweeping rule changes were put in place. The most controversial, and theatrical, was the new power given to extra officials who watched closely from the stands.  Aided by binoculars, and replay technology used by broadcasters, they are able to pull a player off the field immediately if they think they have had a bad knock to the head.  Like telling a pummelled boxer he has been beaten, the concussion decisions rarely go down well. It leads to temper tantrums from players and management, boos from the crowd, and onlookers such as Donald Trump crowing that the sport has gone "soft".  College football in the US is just as affected. While university sports in the UK are witnessed by a handful of friends and family - with the Boat Race the exception - the college game here is massive.  Stanford Stadium holds 50,000, and is home to the beloved Cardinals. Here the binocular-holding experts are so isolated and free from pressure the match organisers refused tell us exactly where they were.  No bother - because we were actually there to meet a team working on some ground-breaking technology being implemented right across the college football scene. It has the potential to not only make the sport safer, but to stop pulling players off the field unnecessarily.  If a Cardinals player has a hit to the head, they are immediately handed over to forensic pathologist Dr Jam Ghajar and Stanford Athletics head Scott Anderson, who are waiting at pitchside.  The player puts on an Oculus Rift, the virtual reality designed, originally, for video gaming.  Special software - loaded on to a Microsoft Surface tablet - uses the Rift to detect a player's eye movements with great accuracy. After a series of exercises, in which the footballer must follow a dot around the screen with his eyes, an assessment is made.  Erratic eye movements, or a failure to keep up, are a good hint that the brain has taken a knock that may be more serious than mere dizziness. (The same method can also be used, as this reporter found out, to detect sleep deprivation.)  It means the player can see for themselves that they are hurt - a pictorial representation about why it is unsafe to continue.  And on the flip side, and at a time when officials are being told to err on the side of caution, it makes it safer to send players back on with certainty that they are fit and able.  The software is being trialled at several college teams across the US. It is not approved by the Federal Drugs Administration - a respected but lengthy process - but the hope among Dr Ghajar and his team is that it one day will be.  Their efforts, and several like it across the sport, are striving to keep America's most bombastic sport entertaining but, above all else, safe.

Ministers want to cut Employment Support Allowance by £30 a week to spur some new claimants to return to work.  But Labour, Lib Dem and independent peers joined forces to block the move, arguing it would make it harder for those affected to pay for the support that might allow them to find work.  The government may try to overturn it at a later date in the Commons.  Ministers lost the vote on an amendment to the Welfare Reform and Work Bill by 283 votes to 198, a majority of 85.  The vote was welcomed by disability campaigners, who say there is "deep unease" about the cuts to ESA and other benefits.  Opposition peers argued that cuts to Employment Support Allowance (ESA) for new claimants in the Work Related Activity Group (WRAG) - people deemed unfit to work but able to undertake activities to help them move towards work - would cause hardship for substantial numbers of people with disabilities.  Speaking in the debate, crossbencher Lord Low said: "A drop of £1,500 a year in their benefit income from £5,300 to £3,800 will be catastrophic for many disabled people.  "It will exacerbate poverty among the disabled - a third of working age disabled adults live in poverty already compared with only a fifth of those who are not disabled. The government's proposals would push many further towards, or actually into, poverty.  "The proposals would cause unnecessary hardship and anxiety to people who have been independently assessed as unfit for work, and the measures are likely to have a disproportionately adverse impact on disabled people."  Mencap's Ron Holland, who is chair of the Disability Benefits Commission, said: "The government wants to get more disabled people into work, but as a sector we have warned that cutting ESA WRAG, and its equivalent payment in Universal Credit, will directly undermine that commitment whilst pushing disabled people further from work and closer to or into poverty.  "This proposed cut together with the crisis in social care funding means disabled people are facing losses to critical support they need to make ends meet and to be included in society."  Welfare minister Lord Freud said ESA needed reform since, at the moment, only 1% of those in the WRAG category moved off the benefit each month. While the move would save some £55m in its first year, he said £60m would be spent during the same period to help disabled people into work.  "As a government, we want to ensure that we spend money responsibly in a way that improves individuals life chances and helps them achieve their ambitions, rather than paying for a lifetime wasted on benefits," he said.  And former Health Secretary Lord Lansley defended the changes, insisting they would encourage people with a capability to work to find employment.  "The bigger the gap between income in work and income through benefits, the greater the likelihood for people seeking work and finding it," he said.  Earlier on Wednesday, ministers agreed to exempt some adoptive and family groups from plans to limit Universal Credit benefits to only two children.	politics

The London-based telecoms provider said that it alerted police after carrying out a data security review.  However, a spokeswoman stressed that it had seen no evidence that the suspects had been involved with a high-profile cyber-breach last October.  Nearly 157,000 of TalkTalk customers' details, including bank account numbers, were stolen in the breach.  The unnamed suspects do not work for TalkTalk directly but are instead employed by Wipro, a local call centre provider, in Kolkata (Calcutta).  "Following the October 2015 cyber-attack, we have been conducting a forensic review to ensure that all aspects of our security are as robust as possible - including that of our suppliers," the company said.  "Acting on information supplied by TalkTalk, the local police have arrested three individuals who have breached our policies and the terms of our contract with Wipro. We are also reviewing our relationship with Wipro.

Some 1.1 million people have signed a petition saying it supported a trade fuelling wild elephants' slaughter.  The company said it prohibited sales of raw ivory that breached a 1989 international treaty but not of ivory ornaments produced before that date.  Spokeswoman Takako Kaminaga said the ivory trade on the Yahoo Japan Auctions site was "patrolled" 24 hours a day.  "If we find a sale was illegal, we cancel it straight away."  Late last year, the Environmental Investigation Agency, in Washington DC, said the site had auctioned more than 12 tonnes of ivory products, including whole elephant tusks, in 2012-14.  Fake documents had enabled traders to "legalise" more than 1,000 tusks a year since 2011, it said.  Individually owned tusks face no registration requirement in Japan, and the tusks are not marked in any way to ensure the documents are valid for the items being registered.  Poachers kill tens of thousands of elephants a year to meet demand for the material, despite the trade ban, according to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species and other groups.  In September, the US and China agreed to work toward nearly complete bans on the ivory trade, and Japan is increasingly isolated in its stance favouring continued sales.  The international environmental campaign group Avaaz addressed its petition to Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer, Manabu Miyasaka, chief executive of Yahoo Japan, part-owned by Yahoo Inc. and Softbank Corp, and "all other companies allowing ivory sales online".  "As global citizens, we are appalled that you allow ivory to be sold on your site/platform, fuelling elephant extinction," it said.  "We call on you to urgently stop all ivory sales from sites/platforms in Japan and all other markets."  Various other online commerce sites, such as Amazon, say they have already stopped such sales or advertising.  Yahoo Japan was in touch with the local environment ministry and other agencies on the issue, as well as with Yahoo and other shareholders, Ms Kaminaga said.  Asked if the company might alter its stance, she replied: "You can't say there's absolutely no intention to change."  Softbank said in a statement that it had no comment on the issue.	tech

Speaking to BBC Newsnight, Mr Bildt said "friends must stay together" and the EU could start to "fracture" if the UK leaves.  The UK would not be able to access the single market, unless it also retains freedom of movement in the EU, he said.  The UK referendum on membership of the EU is due by the end of 2017.  A UK vote to leave the European Union would result in a "very, very messy separation", he said.  Asked if the UK would be able to stay in the single market, but be able to restrict movement of people, he said did not see that as a viable possibility.  He said the EU would "lose credibility" if the UK leaves and urged the country not to get "bogged down in its own contradictions".  "We are living in a more dangerous world," he said.  "That means friends must stay together. If you suddenly see a Europe that starts to fracture with a significant country leaving, that is going to be a weaker Europe - and in my opinion a more dangerous Europe for everyone."  Mr Bildt was prime minister of Sweden from 1991-1994 and then foreign minister from 2006-2014.  He said his own country was "too far ahead" of the rest of Europe in terms of the numbers of refugees it has taken as a result of the migrant crisis.  "We need to calm down the numbers in Sweden somewhat... Over time we need to move to a truly common asylum system."  Europe had been "surprised by the magnitude of the meltdown in the Middle East", he said.  "We did not have sufficient control of our external borders in the Schengen system - that must be restored. That was a security issue."  But he said he found discussion in the UK around border control "somewhat bizarre".  "When you go past Calais and go into the tunnel, there is barbed wire," he said.  "The French are protecting the external border of the United Kingdom now... It looks like you have control of the external border today."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35420579	Google achieves AI 'breakthrough' by beating Go champion	A Google artificial intelligence program has beaten the European champion of the board game Go.  The Chinese game is viewed as a much tougher challenge than chess for computers because there are many more ways a Go match can play out.  The tech company's DeepMind division said its software had beaten its human rival five games to nil.  One independent expert called it a breakthrough for AI with potentially far-reaching consequences.  The achievement was announced to coincide with the publication of a paper, in the scientific journal Nature, detailing the techniques used.  Earlier on Wednesday, Facebook's chief executive had said its own AI project had been "getting close" to beating humans at Go.  But the research he referred to indicated its software was ranked only as an "advanced amateur" and not a "professional level" player.  Go is thought to date back to ancient China, several thousand years ago.  Using black-and-white stones on a grid, players gain the upper hand by surrounding their opponents pieces with their own.  The rules are simpler than those of chess, but a player typically has a choice of 200 moves compared with about 20 in chess.  There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe, according to DeepMind's team.  It can be very difficult to determine who is winning, and many of the top human players rely on instinct.  DeepMind's chief executive, Demis Hassabis, said its AlphaGo software followed a three-stage process, which began with making it analyse 30 million moves from games played by humans.  "It starts off by looking at professional games," he said.  "It learns what patterns generally occur - what sort are good and what sort are bad. If you like, that's the part of the program that learns the intuitive part of Go.  "It now plays different versions of itself millions and millions of times, and each time it gets incrementally better. It learns from its mistakes.  "The final step is known as the Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is really the planning stage.  "Now it has all the intuitive knowledge about which positions are good in Go, it can make long-range plans."  Tested against rival Go-playing AIs, Google's system won 499 out of 500 matches,  And last October, DeepMind invited Fan Hui, Europe's top player, to its London office for a series of games, each of which the AI won.  "Many of the best programmers in the world were asked last year how long it would take for a program to beat a top professional, and most of them were predicting 10-plus years," Mr Hassabis said.  "The reasons it was quicker than people expected was the pace of the innovation going on with the underlying algorithms and also how much more potential you can get by combining different algorithms together."  Prof Zoubin Ghahramani, of the University of Cambridge, said: "This is certainly a major breakthrough for AI, with wider implications.  "The technical idea that underlies it is the idea of reinforcement learning - getting computers to learn to improve their behaviour to achieve goals.  "That could be used for decision-making problems - to help doctors make treatment plans, for example, in businesses or anywhere where you'd like to have computers assist humans in decision making.  "It doesn't mean that Google is ahead of all other companies in AI - there are many artificial intelligences.  "But in terms of devoting resources to Go, Google has clearly done more.  "Facebook has achieved some pretty spectacular results in other areas of artificial intelligence, but I think Google has beaten them to this particularly important challenge."  DeepMind now intends to pit AlphaGo against Lee Sedol - the world's top Go player - in Seoul in March.  In addition, it continues to develop AI systems that can play computer games without any help, following last year's success at getting its bots to teach themselves how to play several dozen classics.  "For us, Go is the pinnacle of board game challenges," said Mr Hassabis.  "Now, we are moving towards 3D games or simulations that are much more like the real world rather than the Atari games we tackled last year. "	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35424606	House points	The fly-fishers are back; when the chairs of select committees were up for election last summer, MPs learned to dread running the gauntlet of glad-handing candidates who would lurk at various strategic bottlenecks angling for votes.  The departure of Huw Irranca-Davies, who's quitting Westminster to seek a seat in the Welsh Assembly, has created an opening for a chair of the Environmental Audit Committee - which he has only held for a couple of months. That committee chair has been allocated to the Labour Party - but all MPs across all parties have a vote in the election, which will be held next week.  Nominations close on Monday, and so far three runners have emerged: former leadership candidate Mary Creagh, Co-Op party stalwart Geraint Davies and Barry Gardiner. That last name is an interesting one, because Mr Gardiner - an acknowledged energy policy expert - is part of Labour's shadow energy team.  He says his leadership are completely relaxed about his attempt to swap the front bench for the committee corridor. An effective chair is crucial to the impact a select committee has, and Environmental Audit, with its cross-government remit, could become a real powerhouse, under the right leadership.  Looking at the membership of the special select committee peers voted to set up, to consider the impact of the Trade Union Bill on party funding (there were warnings that its provisions could cut funding for the Labour Party by £6m), I suspect there might be.  The crossbench peer and former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns is the chairman, and batting for the government are four Conservatives: Lord Callanan, Lord de Mauley, Lord Robathan and Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury. Labour field ex-union officials Baroness Dean (former Leader of SOGAT), Lord (Larry) Whitty (ex GMB) and Baroness Drake (a former President of the TUC) plus the former Leader of the House, Lord Richard. The Lib Dem contingent consists of Lord Tyler, who first proposed this committee, and Lord Wrigglesworth.  And the team is completed by the newly arrived Crossbencher, the Earl of Kinnoull.  Looking at that cast of characters, the committee will probably end up providing a line of argument helpful to the Labour-Lib Dem cause when it reports at the end of February, tee-ing up hostile amendments which could well be voted through at report stage - unless both Crossbench peers repeatedly side with the Conservatives.  Last week saw a relative rarity; a meeting of the Commons Privileges Committee, which deals with matters touching the rights of the House. It was a private meeting so I don't know what they talked about - but just about the only privileges issue in their in-tray is the complaint from the last parliament that three witnesses, Tom Crone, Colin Myler and Les Hinton, and that the company they had worked for, News International, misled the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee….  This dates all the way back to 2012 when, on a majority vote, the committee included that claim in their report on the phone hacking scandal.  While there were a number of live criminal trials of other individuals accused of hacking offences, the Privileges Committee postponed any action - but the coast is now clear. Could we see a final act in the hacking scandal? Will witnesses like Les Hinton (he issued a rebuttal of the committee's claims, which he called "unfair, unfounded and erroneous") be re-examined, or will the complaint be dropped as quietly as possible. Watch this space.  When an MP is arrested, for whatever reason, the fact is recorded in the Commons business papers; this is an immemorial convention dating back to the days when such an arrest may well have been an attempt by the Crown to interfere in the workings of Parliament. But these days it can highlight an allegation against an MP at an early stage, far earlier than would be the case for non-MPs.  Next month the Commons will vote on a proposal to change that, so in future arrests will only be reported where the Clerks consider that what has happened is, in some way an infringement of the rights of Parliament; so an arrest for, say, a bar-room brawl, would not be publicised in the Commons business papers; but the Damian Green case, where an MP's Commons office was searched, would.  Of course this would not stop Her Majesty's Press finding out in other ways....it just wouldn't be via an official Commons publication.  Blink and you'd have missed the one overt sign of it, but behind the scenes, there's a considerable spat under way about the game-playing over private members' bill debates on a Commons Friday. Last week, private members' bill terminator Chris Chope was so annoyed at the government's tactics that he shouted "object" - and blocked an attempt to give an unopposed second reading to an uncontroversial measure to tidy up an MPs' hardship fund, set up after World War II, much to the visible annoyance of the bill's promoter, Sir Paul Beresford.  A minimal morsel of revenge, perhaps, but it presages a bigger problem. You see, the supply of private members' bills is drying up.  So many of the current crop of bills were killed off at second reading, that there are only a handful left to return to the Commons for report stage and third reading - and there are still plenty of sitting Fridays scheduled: on 29 January, 5 and 26 February, and 4 and 11 March. If there are no bills left to come back to the Commons, where they would take priority for debate, then all sorts of presentation bills and ten minute rule bills might suddenly end up being debated.  Bills on subjects like human trafficking, ovarian cancer, bat habitats, BBC privatisation and much, much more might surface for debate.  And since most of them emanate from Mr Chope and his usual suspect colleague, Peter Bone, they will mostly be on subjects the government would prefer not to have debated and not to have to respond to. I particularly like the sound of Mr Bone's Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which currently tops the agenda on 4 March.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35419090	PMQs: Labour attacks PM's 'bunch of migrants' comment	David Cameron is facing Labour calls to apologise for calling refugees at a camp in Calais "a bunch of migrants" at Prime Minister's Questions.  Labour MP Yvette Cooper said it was not "appropriate" or "statesmanlike" for him to use such language about a "complex and sensitive" issue.  Shadow minister Kate Green said it was "offensive, hurtful... and divisive".  Mr Cameron said Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had told the migrants at the camp "they could all come to Britain".  At the weekend, the Labour leader visited the Grande-Synthe Camp, near Dunkirk, and The Jungle in Calais, where more than 7,000 people are sleeping rough, describing conditions there as "disgraceful".  Jeremy Corbyn had a good go at David Cameron over the Google tax deal, using a crowd-sourced question from Jeff (or possibly Geoff), who wanted to know whether he could join a scheme allowing him to pay the same rate of tax as the internet giant.  But some commentators felt the Labour leader lost focus when he switched to other subjects for his final two questions.  "We've had no answer on Google, and no answers on Jeff," said Mr Corbyn, before turning to what he calls the "bedroom tax" and a High Court ruling that it is "discriminatory". For his final question, he called on the PM to launch an inquiry into arms export licences to Saudi Arabia amid UN reports of coalition air strikes on civilians in Yemen.  The prime minister responded to that last point by saying the UK had some of the strictest rules for arms exports in the world. He added that Britain was "not part of Saudi-led operations" in Yemen.  But it was one of those weeks when reaction to what was said at PMQs overshadowed anything that was said during the session, as Labour seized on Mr Cameron's "bunch of migrants" comment.  Mr Cameron was coming to the end of a clash with Jeremy Corbyn about Google's tax deal with the government, when he decided, as he often does, to broaden out his attack to other issues.  The Labour leader had just accused him of failing to stand up to Google.  Mr Cameron replied: "The shadow chancellor's pointing - the idea that those two right honourable gentlemen would stand up to anyone in this regard is laughable.  "Look at the record over the last week - they met with the unions and they gave them flying pickets.  "They met with the Argentinians, they gave them the Falkland Islands.  "They met with a bunch of migrants in Calais, they said they could all come to Britain.  "The only people they never stand up for are the British people and hard-working taxpayers."  Several Labour MPs objected to Mr Cameron's "bunch of migrants" comments on Twitter, describing them as "shameful" and "inflammatory" and the PM as "odious".  A Labour spokesman said Mr Cameron's use of the phrase "demonstrates an attitude that is wholly unacceptable to a humanitarian crisis on our doorstep".  Yvette Cooper, who is chairing Labour's refugee task force, said Mr Cameron should use "much more statesmanship-like" language on such a "complex and sensitive" issue, particularly given ongoing commemorations of Holocaust victims.  She got to her feet immediately after Prime Minister's Questions to raise a point of order  She asked Commons Speaker John Bercow to ask Mr Cameron to "withdraw" the comment.  Mr Bercow told Ms Cooper: "You speak with enormous experience in this House and I respect what you say.  "I completely identify and empathise with your observations about Holocaust Memorial Day, which you and I on other occasions have marked at events together - so I take what you say extremely seriously."  He ruled that it was not "disorderly" or "un-Parliamentary" but added "people will make their own assessments of this matter".  The prime minister's spokesman said the government had spent £1.2bn to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in camps in the region and he said Labour's approach would "open the door and provide an incentive for more to come to Calais".  Asked if he considered the phrase "bunch of migrants" to be pejorative the spokesman said "the PM thinks that the key thing here is getting the policy right".  Mr Cameron was accused by some opponents of using the "bunch of migrants" phrase to distract attention from criticism of the Google agreement.  But this was dismissed as "silly and playing cheap politics" by small business minister Anna Soubry  She told BBC Radio 4's The World at One Mr Cameron had been using the "language of ordinary people", adding "we all use slang" in the heat of the moment.  David Cameron insisted he has done more than any other prime minister to crack down on aggressive tax avoidance and blamed Labour for failures in collecting taxes from large multinationals.  Mr Corbyn claimed Google was paying an effective tax rate of 3% - and accused the government of sending out mixed messages, with Chancellor George Osborne initially describing the deal as a "major success" before No 10 rowed back, calling it a "step forward", while, he said, London mayor Boris Johnson labelled it "derisory".  Mr Cameron then went on to explain the measures the Government has put in place to tackle tax avoidance and evasion before claiming the tax rate for Google under Labour was "0%".  Mr Corbyn also pointed to a series of meetings Google had had with Government ministers.  "Millions of people are this week filling in their tax returns to get them in by the 31st," he said.  "They have to send the form back, they do not get the option of 25 meetings with 17 ministers to decide what their rate of tax is.  "Many people going to their HMRC offices or returning them online this week will say this - 'Why is there one rule for big multinational companies and another for ordinary, small businesses and self-employed workers?"'  Mr Cameron brushed off the criticism by launching into an attack on all the things Labour did not stand up to, including migrants.  Firstly: George Osborne risked sounded far too content when he hailed the deal as a "victory" and a "major success". Government spokesmen were reluctant to repeat his verdict.  Secondly: Labour reacted quickly and managed to get a hearing. Their message sounded louder than their internal disputes, for a change.  Thirdly: voters care. The perception international firms get a better deal than ordinary people is toxic.  HMRC collects tax, not ministers, and the government says it has acted and got results where Labour did not.  But few politicians ever caught the mood of a nation declaring themselves happy with a big business's tax return.  Mr Cameron began Prime Minister's Questions by announcing that a "striking" memorial to the victims of Nazi atrocities is to be erected beside Parliament, in Victoria Tower Gardens, where a number of monuments already stand.  Downing Street said an international design competition will be launched in the coming weeks and the memorial built by the end of 2017.  "It will stand beside Parliament as a permanent statement of our values as a nation and will be something for our children to visit for generations to come," Mr Cameron said.  "It is right that our whole country should stand together to remember the darkest hour of humanity."  The SNP again challenged the prime minister to help those women born in the 1950s, affected by pension equalisation, with the party's leader at Westminster using both of his questions to press the point.  He called on David Cameron to respect a Parliamentary decision to immediately introduce transitional arrangements for those women negatively impacted (the vote was non-binding and does not compel ministers to act).  Mr Cameron did not address the point directly, but claimed the introduction of a single tier pension at £155 a week would end discrimination because "so many women retiring will get so much more in their pension".  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron is guaranteed one question at PMQs every month and he used his latest opportunity to urge the prime minister to do more to alleviate the refugee crisis facing Europe.  "The only way to challenge a crisis of that magnitude is by starting working with our European colleagues at the heart of a united Europe," he said.  He urged Mr Cameron to "welcome in and provide a home" to 3,000 unaccompanied children as recommended by campaigners.  In response, Mr Cameron said no country in Europe had been "more generous" in supporting refugee camps in the Middle East but the UK would not be taking part in the EU's refugee relocation and resettlement schemes as it was not in its national interest.	politics

Scott Cawthon said he had arranged for anyone who bought the game on the Steam platform to be able to claim a refund.  And, after admitting he had rushed it, he said he would rework the game and make it free once it was rereleased.  The game received relatively positive feedback from Steam users but negative reviews from critics.  FNaF is a series of horror games that proved popular thanks to its creepy characters and jump-scares.  "Even though the game had a 'very positive' rating with 87%, I was not satisfied with the reviews and ratings it was getting," Mr Cawthon said.  For that reason, he said, he had decided to remove the game from Steam, a platform used to distribute software digitally to desktop computers.  He said he had asked the US company Valve, which runs Steam, to "make it so that the game can be refunded regardless of the amount of the time it has been owned, meaning that anyone can get a refund at any time".  Games bought on the platform normally have a time limit, after which refunds are not usually given.  Mr Cawthon said that, once he had finished it, the demo currently available on the gaming platform GameJolt would be replaced with the full version.  "I'm still going to work on FNaF World and polish it up. I'm busy creating a fully 3D overworld for the game. From this point forward, the game will always be free.  "I appreciate your support, and I encourage you all to refund your Steam game (even if you enjoyed the game), and download the new version when it becomes available on GameJolt," he wrote on the Steam page dedicated to the previous instalment in the FNaF series.  The withdrawn game, which was released last Thursday, is a spin-off of the FNaF series and differs from the first four.  In a statement posted on the FNaF World page last week, Mr Cawthon wrote: "You know, I've been accused of rushing my games ever since FNaF 1, but I've never felt that I'd released a game too early… until now."  He admitted the latest game was incomplete and that he "got too eager to show the things that were finished".  "I neglected to pay attention to the things that weren't," he said, apologising to fans of the series.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35422772	Corbyn must connect with public to survive says Kinnock	Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock has questioned whether Jeremy Corbyn can win power and said he could face calls to stand down if he does not "make advances" with the public.  Lord Kinnock said Mr Corbyn's task was to "win power for the party" rather than to "secure power in the party".  While Mr Corbyn should have "space" to lead, he said he must pass clear tests.  And he suggested that if Mr Corbyn failed to connect with the electorate, "he may come to his own conclusions".  In an article for the New Statesman, Lord Kinnock - who led the party between 1983 and 1992 and lost two general elections - appealed for the party to pull together, saying any split in Labour's ranks similar to that which led to the creation of the SDP in the 1980s would be very damaging.  He said Mr Corbyn must be judged on his performance but suggested it was hard for the Labour leader and his close allies to "uphold unity" given Mr Corbyn's record of rebelling against former leaders, including himself.  Assessing Labour's and Mr Corbyn's long-term prospects, he wrote: "It's difficult to see that [Jeremy Corbyn is electable].  "Many of the people who voted for Jeremy are outstanding party members who said that they were frustrated - indeed, infuriated - by the failure of Labour to connect with the electorate.  "I know exactly what they mean, but that's the test. If Jeremy is seen to be failing to connect to the electorate after a reasonable space of time then he may come to his own conclusions."  Lord Kinnock, who supported Andy Burnham for leader in last year's contest, added: "There's a fundamental question here and it is whether people want to secure power in the party or to win power for the party.  "Those people who want to win power, whether they're left, right or centre, will be watching the evidence and will make their decision on the basis of that evidence. Not because of some spasm of emotion, or the fact that their candidate didn't get elected:  "They'll want to know they have a party that is being led in its advance with the electorate. If that isn't the case then conclusions must be drawn."  Mr Corbyn, who had never served on the frontbench in his long political career before being elected in a landslide victory in September, has insisted that he is making progress as opposition leader and has forced the government onto the back foot on a range of issues.  He has acknowledged that elections in May for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and English councils, as well as the election of a new London Mayor, will be an important test of his leadership and standing with the public.  The Conservatives are seeking to turn the mayoral contest into a referendum on Mr Corbyn's leadership, describing Labour candidate Sadiq Khan as "Mr Corbyn's man in City Hall".  Labour's official report into its 2015 defeat published last week concluded it would be a "huge challenge" for Labour to win power in 2020, whoever was leader.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35420573	Apple fixes Safari crash search bug	Apple believes it has fixed a problem that caused its Safari web browser to crash when users carried out a search via its address bar.  The problem appears to have begun earlier in the day.  Users had complained that they had experienced the bug on both the firm's mobile devices and its Mac computers.  Apple recently updated its iOS and OS X operating systems, but users who had not installed the new versions had also reported the fault.  This would suggest that the problem was caused by a process happening at Apple's data centres, rather than a coding error in Safari itself.  Apple has not provided a comment about the fault.  But the BBC understands that the fix may take some time to go through for everyone.  Users can, however, speed up the process by clicking on the "clear history and website data" in Safari's preferences.  The issue only impacted people whose "suggestions cache" had updated while they were using the phone between 09:00 GMT and 12:00 GMT.  As a result, Europe-based device owners were more likely to have been affected than those in Asia or the US.  Earlier in the week, it emerged that a web link had gone viral that forced Safari to crash.  The page the browser was sent to used a JavaScript to put the software into a loop forcing it to fail.  However, the more recent problem appears to have been much more widespread, and was been replicated by the BBC.  Apple revealed on Tuesday that there are about one billion of its core devices in use.  The vast majority of those may have been affected, although the number also includes its set-top TV boxes and smartwatches, which do not use the browser.	tech

Centene Corporation said it was conducting an internal search for six hard drives containing the information.  Customers' names, addresses and dates of birth were included, as well as their social security numbers, membership details and health information, Centene said.  But no financial or payment details of customers were on the drives, it said.  "While we don't believe this information has been used inappropriately, out of abundance of caution and in transparency, we are disclosing an ongoing search for the hard drives," said Centene's chief executive, Michael Neidorff.  "The drives were a part of a data project using laboratory results to improve the health outcomes of our members."  Centene said the hard drives contained the personal health information of about 950,000 people who had received laboratory services between 2009 and 2015.  It said it would notify those affected and offer them free healthcare monitoring.  The company also said it would reinforce and review its procedures.  The BBC asked whether the information on the hard drives was encrypted and how they were had been lost, but Centene did not respond.  "The stakes are high because Centene handles sensitive health information relating to its members. It is, therefore, highly likely that they will have to make a report to US regulatory authorities and will be fined for any data loss," Alison Rea, a lawyer at Kemp Little, told the BBC.  She said that, while Centene's "upfront" approach to the issue was commendable, it meant that some people may launch damages claims before the full extent of the data loss was known.  "If the data has been lost within the organisation, the potential damage suffered by Centene's members will be minimal. However, if the data has been taken offsite and is now in the public domain, the damages claims Centene faces could be much higher," she said.  "As Centene provides health insurance solutions for the under-insured and uninsured public in the USA, the release of details of who their members are and their medical information could be highly damaging.  "Not only will it cause personal distress to the individuals involved if their friends and families find out about their medical history, but also because it could make it harder for those people to secure medical health insurance with other providers in the future."  Paul Farringdon, of the security company Veracode, said: "If this data was found and accessed, it could lead to fraudsters piecing together a bigger picture of information on individuals that could be used to trick users into giving away money, power and information to people who would do harm.  "Information already available from other breaches on the dark web can be used to provide an enriched view on patients."  One of the largest similar breaches took place in 2014 at Sutherland Healthcare Solutions, which handles medical billing and collections.  According to reports, nearly 340,000 people were affected when eight computers were stolen during a break-in.  In 2015, the US health insurer CareFirst admitted the information belonging to 1.1 million of its customers had been exposed in a hack in June the previous year.  Similar attacks on Anthem and Blue Cross in 2015 saw 80 million and 11 million records lost, respectively.	tech

The social network's founder added that the work was being done close to his desk, signalling the importance he is giving to the task.  One expert said the challenge could result in far-reaching benefits.  It is the second time Mr Zuckerberg has highlighted work on AI this month.  Facebook is far from the only tech firm to have used computers to play Go - a game with trillions of possible moves.  Microsoft's research division began developing AI software to tackle the issue in 2004, and ended up releasing an Xbox video game six years later that made use of its techniques.  Google's AI chief Demis Hassabis has also indicated that his DeepMind team is working on the game.  Go is thought to have first been played more than 2,500 years ago in ancient China.  Two people take turns to place black or white stones on to a grid, with the goal being to dominate the board by surrounding the opponent's pieces.  Once placed, the stones cannot be moved unless they are surrounded and captured by the other person's pieces.  It has been estimated that there are 10 to the power of 700 (10 multiplied by itself 699 times) possible ways a Go game could be played.  By contrast, chess - a game at which AIs can already play at grandmaster level - has about 10 to the power of 60 possible scenarios.  "Scientists have been trying to teach computers to win at Go for 20 years," wrote Mr Zuckerberg on his Facebook page.  "We're getting close, and in the past six months we've built an AI that can make moves in as fast as 0.1 secs and still be as good as previous systems that took years to build.  "Our AI combines a search-based approach that models every possible move as the game progresses along with a pattern matching system built by our computer vision team.  "The researcher who works on this, Yuandong Tian, sits about 20ft from my desk. I love having our AI team right near me so I can learn from what they're working on."  Facebook's Go AI system is codenamed Darkforest, according to a paper submitted in November by Mr Tian to the International Conference on Learning Representations.  He wrote that it had achieved a "stable" five dan level in the game, representing an advanced amateur but below the "professional levels".  However, he acknowledged the software still had flaws.  "Sometimes the bot plays tenuki ("move elsewhere") pointlessly when a tight local battle is needed," Mr Tian wrote.  "When the bot is losing, it shows the typical behaviour of MCTS [a machine learning technique known as Monte Carlo Tree Search], that plays bad moves and loses more. We will improve these in the future."  Facebook is currently trying to use other AI systems to answer questions and carry out tasks on its Messenger chat platform.  Mr Zuckerberg has also made public his desire to build a "simple AI" to power his home and help him at work this year.  One independent researcher said the firm's work on Go could have knock-on benefits.  "Go is vastly harder than chess using any of the standard techniques for game-playing, and for some time it's been the case that people have regarded that you would need something fundamentally new in order to crack it," explained Dr Sean Holden from the University of Cambridge's computer laboratory.  "Playing games like this is essentially a search problem. The AI has to search for a sequence of actions that will get you from the start of the game to a winning position.  "And that general search problem is potentially usable in all manner of different AI scenarios.  "Because, what AI essentially comes down to is that if you have a robot and you want it to achieve a task, you want it to find a sequence of moves from where it is to where you want it to be."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35414310	Leaving EU 'would cut migration by 100,000'	Net migration could fall by about 100,000 a year if the UK leaves the EU and introduces work permits for EU citizens, a pressure group has said.  Migration Watch says this would cut net migration - the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving - from 180,000 to 65,000 a year.  But James McGrory, from the pro-EU Britain Stronger In Europe campaign, called the report "disingenuous".  He said it was an "another example of the Leave campaign fudging the facts".  The UK is set to have a referendum by the end of 2017 on whether or not it should remain a member of the European Union.  The report from Migration Watch, which advocates tighter immigration controls, looks at possible policies that could be introduced if the UK voted to leave the EU and considers their impact on overall migration figures.  No-one knows for sure what impact a British exit from the EU would have on immigration.  It would depend on the terms of a new settlement that might take months to negotiate and years to put into place.  But say, as Migration Watch advocates, that it did herald controls on the flow of low-skilled EU migrant labour, would that really work in reducing net migration?  Wouldn't there be an influx of migrants from the EU before the restrictions came into force?  Wouldn't businesses that currently rely on labourers, chambermaids and supermarket shelf-stackers from Europe demand that they be allowed to recruit them from elsewhere?  And wouldn't the EU introduce work permits for British workers, thereby reducing emigration from the UK?  These are questions that need answers in the months leading up to the referendum.  The report suggested the key change could be the introduction of work permits which would limit EU nationals entering the country to higher-skilled workers, their family members and students, while low-skilled workers would not be granted entry.  Lord Green of Deddington, chairman of Migration Watch, said: "It is time to examine possible alternative immigration regimes."  Under the current arrangements, signs indicated migration to Britain would "continue at a substantial rate for the foreseeable future", he said.  "Indeed, immigrants tend to generate further migration as their friends and relatives join them in their new countries," he said.  "Work permits for EU citizens would substantially reduce net migration and its resultant pressure on our population and public services."  The 16-page paper suggests that on average only about 20% of EU migrants who came to Britain between 2004 and 2014 were doing higher-skilled work.  It said: "This could substantially reduce the EU inflow for work to perhaps one fifth of its recent level and would, in turn, substantially reduce net migration by perhaps 100,000 a year from the current level of 180,000."  The figures should not be taken as a "precise estimate" but were "intended to illustrate the scale of the potential reduction under the policy outlined", it said.  There would be no need for restrictions on EU citizens coming to the UK as students or tourists, the authors concluded.  Those who are "self-sufficient" would also be free to live in Britain, including those who are looking for jobs.  Under the suggested system there would also be no restriction on EU family members of British citizens coming to join them, while relatives of European skilled workers and students would have the right to live and work in the UK.  Those EU citizens already living and working in the UK would retain their existing rights, Migration Watch suggested.  However, pro-EU campaigner Mr McGrory said: "Right now, Britain has the best of both worlds. We have an opt-out from the passport-free Schengen area, while still enjoying full access to the single market.  "The Leave campaigns haven't produced a shred of evidence to show how they could guarantee a deal that is at least as good if we left."  The Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford said if it became harder for employers to recruit EU workers they may try to bring in more migrants from outside Europe.  Most recent estimated net migration to the UK reached a record 336,000 in the year to June 2015 according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures.	politics

Arnnon Geshuri, a former human resources manager at Google, was appointed to the board of the Wikimedia Foundation this month.  The online encyclopaedia's editors objected because of his links to an alleged no poaching scandal.  Last January, Apple, Google, Intel and Adobe agreed to settle a lawsuit over related claims for $415m (£289m).  One Wikipedia editor said they were "appalled" by Mr Geshuri's appointment to the Wikimedia Foundation board of trustees, while another criticised the Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales.  About 20 editors, including two trustees, have publicly backed Mr Geshuri.  One editor unhappy about the appointment wrote: "I'm appalled: Why this kind of person, with this kind of background, at all?"  Another added: "I have no more confidence for the whole board, especially also to name Mr Wales himself. The board presents itself in a tragic condition, all faith lost that it could work for the best of the projects."  The no confidence call was accompanied by a statement, which indicated that an open letter had already been sent to the chairman of Wikimedia's board.  It noted Mr Geshuri had been "widely known for having played a significant role in the anticompetitive agreements scandal at Google".  "A vote of the community has no legal weight, but should be taken into consideration by the board of trustees to fulfil the Wikimedia Foundation statement of values," it added.  Documents filed with a US court indicated that Mr Geshuri, who now works for Tesla Motors, had been involved in enforcing a deal struck between Apple and Google not to poach each other's staff.  In a 2007 email, while he was working at Google, he assured his boss Eric Schmidt that a company employee would be "terminated within the hour" for approaching an Apple staff member.  Mr Schmidt had contacted Mr Geshuri after Apple's co-founder Steve Jobs had complained to him, the documents indicated.  In 2015, those two firms, as well as Intel and Adobe, agreed to pay out damages before the case could be heard. They had been accused of conspiring to keep down salaries.  The firms did not disclose the details of the settlement.  The Wikimedia Foundation, a not-for profit organisation founded by Jimmy Wales, administers Wikipedia and other projects.  Its board has 10 trustees and Mr Geshuri is one of the two most recently appointed.  In a message to Wikipedia editors posted on Tuesday, Mr Geshuri wrote: "Although I would have preferred the tone surrounding my appointment to be more positive and supportive, I deeply understand and respect the criticality of free expression, rallying around convictions, and open disagreement."  In an apparent reference to the allegations he was linked to the "no poaching" scandal, he said there were "misconceptions" and "mitigating considerations".  Mr Geshuri wrote: "As a general matter, I will say that, throughout my career, I have been charged with enforcing company policies as part of my role as a people manager. I have tried to do so thoughtfully and consistently. I have done so realising company policies and practices evolve over time as circumstances change." He added that he wanted to win the editors' trust.  Mr Wales did not respond to a request for comment.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35376327	DDoS: Website-crippling cyber-attacks to rise in 2016	Cyber-attacks that bring down websites and online services have been getting bigger every year. But how will businesses cope in 2016?  Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks work by overloading websites or other online services with traffic.  They have the power to knock whole sites offline and are usually carried out by automated bots or programmes.  Victims of such attacks in the past month include the Irish National Lottery and the BBC while in 2014 the popular videogame Wurm was also hit.  Darren Antsee, chief security technologist at software company Arbor Networks, believes the world is in an "arms race" between those carrying out DDoS attacks and those who try to defend against them  His firm conducts an annual survey of internet service providers on the subject and the company also takes in data from its "Atlas" system - which monitors 300 providers every hour.  Mr Antsee says this gives the firm an idea of what's happening across "about a third of the internet".  A newly published report from the company suggests attacks are getting bigger and more sophisticated - with more and more businesses suffering.  More than 200 of the reported attacks in 2015 summoned 100 gigabits per second (Gbps) of traffic, with the largest of these clocking in at 500 Gbps - enough to disrupt an entire internet service provider's network.  To put that in context, in 2014 internet connectivity for the entire country of Kenya was about 500 Gbps.  But Mr Antsee says the larger attacks are not the real story.  Instead, it's the "big jump" in more sophisticated DDoS raids which, though smaller in terms of gigabits per second, target specific parts of a website which are more easily overwhelmed.  These often involve some clever analysis of how a website functions before an attack is launched, according to John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer at DDoS protection service Coudflare.  "If you know that, say, on an e-commerce website, adding something to the basket takes a long time, what we'll see is attackers doing that over and over again to consume resources," he says.  What's even more worrying is that there is now a wide range of "booter" services which offer to launch DDoS against specific targets for as little as $10 (£7).  "My sense is that DDoS is just part of the internet at this point - it happens," adds Mr Graham-Cumming.  Mr Antsee concurs and points out that a variety of motivations could prompt attacks these days.  The most common now, according to the Arbor Networks survey, is criminals flexing their muscles against online targets to demonstrate their capabilities.  Businesses occasionally dabble in attacking competitors, and there are also reports of individuals using DDoS for extortion - in which a ransom fee is demanded from the owners of a victim site.  Finally, it's also sometimes the case that DDoS attacks will take place for "ideological" reasons - a website supporting a political viewpoint might be thrown offline by supporters of the opposing view, for example.  In terms of protection, companies like Cloudflare offer to analyse web traffic for signs of malicious requests which can often weed out unwanted connections.  Mr Antsee adds that "infrastructure access control lists" (ACLs) can be installed in routers and switches to detect suspicious patterns in traffic.  However, the more sophisticated attacks mentioned above which target weak points in a website's structure are not always preventable with such technology.  "You need to be using more intelligent DDoS mitigation systems to absorb that kind of traffic," says Mr Antsee.  Interestingly, he also comments that there is quite a large disparity between the number of attacks like this detected by service providers and the number seen by businesses - suggesting that more might need to be done before their true scale is understood.  As a result of these developments, it is widely expected that the market for DDoS protection services is set to grow this year.  Indeed, 74% of service providers surveyed by Arbor said they had seen an increase in such protections among their customers.  "We certainly don't see things slowing down, the reality is, for a lot of websites, it's easy to knock them offline and so people do it," notes Mr Graham-Cumming.  He adds that these days, it seems as though anyone could be a target.  "Who gets DDoS'd? It's everybody, really."	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35412680	Londoners should not let Corbyn 'experiment' with city	David Cameron has urged Londoners not to elect Labour's Sadiq Khan as their next mayor, claiming they will become "lab rats" for party leader Jeremy Corbyn's economic experiments.  Speaking at a rally for Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith, the prime minister warned about the dangers of a Labour victory for the capital's economy.  Mr Goldsmith said his Labour rival was "Mr Corbyn's man" in City Hall.  But Mr Khan said he was "no patsy" to Mr Corbyn and would stand up to him.  It is 100 days until London elects a new mayor to succeed Boris Johnson, who is stepping down after eight years.  The vote will be a key electoral test for Jeremy Corbyn and Labour, for whom the capital was one of the few bright spots in last year's dismal general election defeat. Last May, Labour won four seats from the Tories in London and hope to win back City Hall for the first time since 2008.  Addressing a rally of Conservative activists, Mr Cameron sought to frame the election as an early verdict on Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour party as well as a choice between Mr Goldsmith and Mr Khan.  "Zac Goldsmith can be a great mayor. You've got the man and the plan, think for a moment about the alternative," he said.  "Sadiq Khan nominated Jeremy Corbyn to be leader of the Labour party and he doesn't regret it. Never mind the fact he (Mr Corbyn) wants to give the Falklands back to Argentina or he thinks that nuclear submarines should patrol the Atlantic without any missiles.  "His policy is to bring back and legalise secondary strikes and flying pickets. Just think what the first Corbyn-elected Mayor would be like for our economy, for our city. You do not want to be lab rats in the first Corbyn economic experiment in public life".  Ahead of the rally, the Conservatives launched a poster campaign depicting Mr Goldsmith as "your man in City Hall".  In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Mr Khan said he would stand up to the Labour leader over the issue of Trident renewal and Mr Corbyn's plans for a "Robin Hood" tax on financial transactions, which Mr Khan opposes.  "That is the job of the Mayor of London: not to be a patsy or a spokesperson for George Osborne and David Cameron - as Mr Goldsmith is being - or Jeremy Corbyn or the party, but to be London's advocate to their party and the government."  While he said he did not regret nominating Mr Corbyn for leader - and therefore allowing him to get onto the ballot paper - he said he would have his "own mandate" if he was elected.  "There will be occasions when frankly speaking I disagree with Jeremy," he said, citing his support for Gatwick expansion and pro-business agenda.  He said he wanted to build the broadest electoral alliance: "When you meet and study the best mayors from around the world they are not tribal. What they try and do is to reach across the entire city."  The Liberal Democrats, UKIP, the Green Party and the English Democrats are also fielding candidates in May's election while former Respect MP George Galloway is also standing. The Conservatives and Labour won 84% of the vote between them in the first round in 2012.	politics

In her first broadcast interview, Alison Johnson told BBC Newsnight that the party had acted insensitively and offered no support to them since the death of their son, Elliott, in September last year.  "They are probably thinking that... we will go away quietly. But we won't. I want justice for my son," she said.  The Conservative Party said: "We would like to again express our very deepest sympathies to Elliott's family and friends."  BBC Newsnight has also learned that 15 key witnesses have called for the removal of a senior Conservative official from any involvement with the party's inquiry into the scandal.  A number of them told Newsnight they would be reluctant to talk to the investigation while the official, who has previously been associated with the former activist at the heart of the scandal, is involved in the handling of the inquiry in any way.  Mrs Johnson's son committed suicide last year after allegedly being bullied by Mark Clarke - the man who ran a road-trip campaign bussing Conservative supporters to marginal constituencies before last year's General Election.  The death of the 21-year-old led to claims the Conservative Party Headquarters (CCHQ) had ignored complaints and warnings about the conduct of Clarke and others.  This prompted the resignation from the government of Grant Schapps, who had been co-chair of the party, and the launch of an inquiry by the London law firm, Clifford Chance.  Mrs Johnson told the BBC she and her husband Ray had been frozen out by the Conservative Party.  "The Conservative Party have not been forthright in coming to speak to us in any way. Anything we've heard we've had to hear through the press. When they engaged Clifford Chance to do the investigation we heard through the press."  She said that they had been particularly offended when it appeared the inquiry wanted to speak to her and her husband separately. She said it left them feeling like suspects whose accounts were being tested.  "We also heard that they wanted to interview me and my husband individually, to find out what our stories are... But it is not a story. It is the facts. We can only deal with the facts. Elliott has now gone, we can only deal with the facts."  A spokesman for Clifford Chance said: "We are sorry to learn of the Johnsons' concerns about the proposed interview format and would welcome the opportunity to discuss alternative arrangements for them to be interviewed."  Mrs Johnson also said it felt like the Conservative Party was keeping them in the dark.  "We live in a backwater so they are probably thinking that if we silence them we will go away quietly, but we won't. We definitely won't. I want justice for my son... no matter how it comes out, I want justice."  Mrs Johnson said Christmas had been awful without her son. An empty chair had been left at the table, she said.  "Every day just drifts into another and you just don't know anything."  Activist says Tory chairman given bullying dossier in 2010  Mrs Johnson spoke as a BBC Newsnight investigation revealed that 15 key witnesses who have potentially valuable testimony about bullying have called for a senior Tory official to step down from the inquiry process.  Though Clifford Chance has been commissioned to conduct the investigation, the firm's final report will be reviewed by group of senior Tories who will decide how the findings are presented.  One of those assessing the conclusions is Rob Semple, chair of the Tory volunteers' organisation, the National Convention. Mr Semple's candidacy for this post was supported by Mark Clarke.  Last year's election was marred by smearing of Mr Semple's rival for the post, Charles Heslop.  Mr Semple told Newsnight he condemned "any alleged negative remarks about another member of the Party that might have been made, without my knowledge, during the National Convention campaign".  However, many potential witnesses to the bullying inquiry believe Mr Semple's presence on the board in untenable - and believe he should step aside from any role in the inquiry.  Ten of the 15 key witnesses told Newsnight that Rob Semple's continued presence on the Board would deter them from giving evidence.  Ben Harris Quinney, chair of the Bow Group, has been invited to give evidence. He has yet to decide whether he will.  "If Rob Semple doesn't stand down it says that the Conservative Party is not interested in doing the right thing and ensuring this doesn't happen again. They are merely interested in trying to cling on and get away with it and hope that the story goes away as quickly as possible," he said.  John Strafford, chairman of the Campaign for Conservative Democracy, told Newsnight that if Mr Semple refuses to recuse himself, CCHQ should order him to do stand down.  "There is no reason whatsoever in my view why anybody who was involved with Mark Clarke should be participating and it would be a bad thing for justice if that happened."  Mr Stafford said the bullying crisis currently engulfing CCHQ was the worst he had experienced in his 40 years as a member the party.  "This is the biggest of all. This is the absolute biggest of all. The party can no longer treat its members with contempt as it has in the past and which it is still doing."  In a statement to Newsnight, Mr Semple said he would not stand down - and denied he was still in touch with Mark Clarke.  "I am committed to ensuring that the highest possible standards of behaviour are upheld. I will ensure… Clifford Chance's findings will be honoured in full. I urge witnesses to come forward so that the full facts are known."  A Conservative Party spokesman said: "Rob Semple is not being asked to step down from the Board when the report is delivered."

Philip Hammond said the talks "are number one on our Europe agenda" but the EU has "other issues on its plate".  It comes amid mounting speculation of a June vote after preparations for the referendum got under way on Tuesday.  Mr Hammond said a June date would be possible if a deal was agreed at next month's European Council summit.  But he stressed that it was more important to get the "right deal" rather than a "quick deal".  David Cameron is renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU, ahead of the vote to be held by the end of 2017.  One of the main sticking points in the talks, appears to be UK proposals to restrict EU migrants' access to benefits for four years - with some countries warning it amounts to discrimination.  Addressing the Lords EU Select Committee, Mr Hammond said: "We have to recognise the fact the European Union has got a couple of other issues on its plate and although the British renegotiation is number one our European agenda I'm afraid it isn't number one on the European agenda of any of our partners, except perhaps for the Irish."  He added: "Unfortunately some of the other things are very much real-time challenges for the EU whereas this agenda is one which can be dealt with in slightly slower time.  "I think it would be inappropriate of us, and it would also be unwise of us, to try and push our agenda ahead of other things which the other EU member states will see as being pressingly urgent to discuss at the summit," he added.  But the foreign secretary said the UK government was "confident" there would be a "substantive discussion" on the renegotiation at the meeting.  Mr Hammond told the committee that if a deal was secured "it will be possible to hold a referendum in June, if we chose to do so".  "If the deal is not done in February that would become much more difficult. Certainly, if it's not done in March it would become impossible".  Adding to speculation of a June referendum, the government laid a motion on Tuesday's Commons order papers setting out some of the rules of the referendum, such as the length of the campaign, funding and the timing of the count.  It means the provisions of the European Union Referendum Act - legislation passed last year paving the way for the vote - will come into force from next month.  BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said the move by the government was likely to face criticism from Eurosceptics given that Mr Cameron has not yet reached a deal with the EU over the reforms he is seeking.  It is thought the PM is anxious to have the rules approved by MPs as swiftly as possible - limiting the ability of people to delay the date of the referendum, he added.  Furthermore, the Electoral Commission has announced that registration for referendum campaigners will open on 1 February.  It applies to individuals and organisations planning to spend more than £10,000 promoting a certain outcome.  From this date, they must declare all donations and loans of more than £7,500. Campaigns must also check donations and loans are from eligible sources.  Any spending on campaigning prior to the start of the referendum period - which will be at least 10 weeks long - does not count towards a campaigner's spending limit.  Bob Posner, the Commission's director of party and electoral finance and legal counsel, said: "Campaigners are central to the referendum and it is important that their sources of funding and spending are transparent to voters.  "Having these provisions in place is part of enabling this."  Referendum timeline: What will happen when?

Minneapolis-based Font Brothers says the manufacturer failed to buy a "special licence" to allow the font's use on its toy packaging and related services.  The company is seeking damages of $150,000 (£104,820) per infringement.  A spokeswoman for Hasbro was unable to comment.  News of the case was first reported by the Torrentfreak news site.  Font Brothers says Hasbro refused to pay the appropriate licensing fees "despite several demands for such action".  The disputed typeface is Generation B - a "playful and offbeat" font inspired by the opening titles of 1961 Walt Disney film The Parent Trap, it says.  Font Brothers charges $20 (£14) for its use on a desktop computer, but its fees rise according to the number of people likely to see it.  The font is still being used by the official My Little Pony website, whose underlying code confirms its use.  A lawyer representing Hasbro declined to provide more information, and the company's legal team has yet to file a response to the allegations.  One lawyer said such disputes were not unusual, but seldom made it into the public eye.  "More than 99% of all intellectual property cases are settled well before they ever end up in court," said Dai Davis, a solicitor who previously represented a company whose font was used on an American clothes-maker's products without permission.  "Generally, they are less emotionally charged than 'who said what to whom' cases because they are more factually based - either someone has a unique typeface that has been taken and used, or not."	tech

Patrick McDonald told officers in Florida that he took out the weapon, despite the firm's firearms ban.  The two got into an altercation when the driver tried to forcibly remove Shane Fabry from the car.  Uber said Mr McDonald, 67, has been suspended and that it would co-operate with police.  Mr Fabry and his fellow passengers told police they were picked up by Mr McDonald on Friday last week as they made their way home.  During the journey, Mr Fabry said he felt ill and asked the driver to pull over in case he was sick but, when Mr McDonald did so, the passenger said he felt fine to continue after all.  Mr McDonald was accused of trying to drag Mr Fabry out of the car by his arm, telling him he must not be sick in a $75,000 (£52,600) vehicle. They said the driver took up an "aggressive fighting stance" and that, after a verbal altercation, he drew a black semi-automatic gun from the driver's side.  In sworn statements, the passengers said the Uber driver pointed the gun at Mr Fabry. While Mr McDonald admitted to police that he drew the weapon, he said he did not point it at his passenger.  According to the police report filed with the Manatee county sheriff's office, he said he had "grabbed it (the gun) because he was in fear for his life".  The report read, that when asked exactly how he was in fear, he said he had heard the passengers making threats.  The 67-year-old driver was released on bail by police in Florida, where the incident took place. He is due to appear in court on Tuesday morning on charges of aggravated assault, with a further appearance on a charge of battery scheduled for 19 February.  Uber spokesman Bill Gibbons told the local paper, the Bradenton Herald, that Mr McDonald's account was deactivated while the firm investigated the incident.  "We stand ready to provide law enforcement with any information that would be helpful to their investigation into this matter," Mr Gibbons said, adding that Mr McDonald started working as an Uber driver in mid-January.  The background checks carried out by Uber, which does not employ its drivers directly, have been criticised in the past, including by a California district attorney and the UK's Licensed Taxi Drivers Association.  It was reported in June last year that Uber changed its firearms policy to ban weapons after one of its drivers shot someone soon after dropping off a passenger in his car. But, later that month, the Washington Times reported that another Uber driver was accused of shooting a passenger who was allegedly choking him, despite the policy.  Roger Chapin of the Florida Taxicab Association said that the latest incident came as the state's lawmakers were considering a bill to "strip away virtually all regulations for Uber".  They are due to vote on the draft law shortly.  "Uber can do their screening but it may not be enough," Mr Chapin said.  "If Uber is the only one with the names of their drivers, how can the public verify they are following the rules?"	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35410646	Motorists caught using phones 'could face bigger penalties'	Drivers caught using hand-held mobiles could face tougher penalties under new plans being considered by ministers.  A Department for Transport consultation says the government's "preferred option" is to increase both penalty points and fines for offenders.  Launched on Tuesday, it cites research suggesting 9% of motorists regularly take "selfies" when behind the wheel.  The consultation will look at whether technology could put motorists' phones into a "drive-safe mode" automatically.  "These proposals ultimately aim to reduce the number of deaths and injuries on the roads," says the government.  The measures relate directly to England and Wales but the document notes that its impact may apply in Scotland.  According to the document, 3,611 reported accidents between 2009-2014 "occurred where at least one driver" was on their phone, but it cautions this is likely to be "significantly under recorded".  Under proposals being considered to improve safety, the number of penalty points given to a motorist using their phone while driving could rise from three to four.  Drivers of Heavy Goods Vehicles could be handed up to six points on their licence.  First time offenders could continue to be offered the chance to attend police safety courses to avoid an endorsement on their licence.  The fine for using a phone whilst driving would also be raised, from £100 to £150.  The document admits that a previous increase in the fine in 2013 - which took it from £60 to £100 - had "no statistically significant change to the number of drivers observed using a hand-held mobile phone from 2009-2014". But it says a bigger fine would "act as a further deterrent for offending behaviour".  Taken together, the changes would "send a clear message on the seriousness of the offence" and reduce "the number of times and offender needed to be caught before being disqualification", it adds.  The consultation - which closes on 15 March - will also look at whether technology could be used to dissuade motorists from using their phones when they are behind the wheel.  Some technologies, it says, enable a phone to detect that it is moving faster (often at about 5-6mph) and divert the handset to a "drive safe mode".  This prevents it from ringing and in some cases can send a text informing the caller or texter that the recipient is driving.  "Much behaviour change work has shown that making it easier for people to do the right thing - in this case, not using a mobile phone whilst driving - can reap significant results.  "For example, putting fresh fruit and vegetables at the start of the school lunch choices has made it easier for children to pick a healthy school lunch.  "Similarly, it would seem logical to conclude that if a driver did not hear their phone ring, they would be less tempted to answer it," the consultation adds.  However, it notes there are potential "difficulties" with such technology, for example for passengers in a car and for people travelling on trains.  The government's consultation cites research from the Institute of Advanced Motorists, which suggested that 9% of drivers regularly take "selfies" while driving.  Its director of policy and research, Neil Greig, said: "For many, smartphone use has become an addiction that we can only start to cure through some form of therapy.  "The IAM does not object to tougher penalties but we do believe that the real deterrent is fear of being caught. That fear can only be increased by increasing the numbers of traffic police on our roads."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35409119	AI pioneer Marvin Minsky dies aged 88	Marvin Minsky, one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence, has died of a cerebral haemorrhage, aged 88.  The mathematician and computer scientist was one of the world's foremost AI experts.  As a student, he built one of the first neural-network learning machines, using vacuum tubes.  He went on to cofound the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Artificial Intelligence Lab, in 1959, with John McCarthy.  Prof Minsky's ideas and influence were wide-ranging - from computational linguistics, mathematics and robotics - but underpinning it all was a desire, in his own words, "to impart to machines the human capacity for commonsense reasoning".  He viewed the brain as a machine whose functions could be replicated in a computer.  And his 1985 book, The Society of Mind, is considered a seminal work in exploring the diversity of mechanisms that interact in intelligence and thought.  His last book, The Emotion Machine, continued the theme, offering a new model for how minds worked.  Some experts have said the field of artificial intelligence is currently experiencing something of a golden age, with deep-learning neural networks making advances in both speech and image recognition.  But, in one of his last interviews, with MIT Technology Review last year, Prof Minsky said there had been "very little growth in artificial intelligence" in the past decade, adding current work had been "mostly attempting to improve systems that aren't very good and haven't improved much in two decades".  By contrast, he said, "the 1950s and 1960s were wonderful - something new every week".  And he hinted he was against large technology companies such as Google and Facebook getting involved the field of AI.  "We have to get rid of the big companies and go back to giving support to individuals who have new ideas because attempting to commercialise existing things hasn't worked very well," he said.  Daniela Rus, director of the lab that Prof Minsky cofounded, now known as the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, said: "Marvin Minsky helped create the vision of artificial intelligence as we know it today."  "The challenges he defined are still driving our quest for intelligent machines and inspiring researchers to push the boundaries in computer science."  Meanwhile, Prof Nicholas Negroponte, cofounder of MIT's Media Lab, said: "Marvin talked in riddles that made perfect sense, were always profound and often so funny that you would find yourself laughing days later.  "His genius was so self-evidence that it defined 'awesome'. The lab bathed in his reflected light."  Prof Minsky was also a talented pianist and, in 1981, wrote an influential paper on the connections between music, psychology and the mind.  He also invented the earliest confocal scanning microscope.  He received many awards over the years, including the Turing Award - the highest honour in computer science - in 1969.

Number 10 said both leaders saw there was genuine goodwill across Europe for Mr Cameron's aims, but accepted there was work to do to find solutions.  A spokesman said they also discussed migration and the Syria conference they will co-host in London next week.  The UK is to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership by the end of 2017.  Mr Cameron has pledged to secure a better deal for the UK in the European Union as a prelude to the referendum, in which voters will be asked whether they want to stay in the EU or leave.  There has been speculation that the PM could call the poll as early as June this year if he gets the backing of the EU's other 27 leaders for his reform demands at a summit in February.  Downing Street also said that while discussing migration during their call, both Mr Cameron and Mrs Merkel agreed that a strong external European border and close co-operation with Turkey were vital.  And they agreed that the Syria conference had "the potential to deliver a substantial increase in both financial and practical support for refugees that would help them to stay in the region".  On Monday, Mr Cameron held talks on the EU with his Irish counterpart Enda Kenny.  Mr Kenny said his personal view was that a deal was possible in February but "he couldn't speak for the other countries around the table".  Referendum timeline: What will happen when?

That was down from a high of just over $132 last May.  As I write this, it's rallying on account of some decent rumours - but it's on Tuesday we'll truly know if 2016 is going to be a tough one for the tech giant.  On the one hand, we're expecting an amazing Christmas with record-breaking revenues, yet again.  But it's Apple's guidance for what to expect in the months to come that investors will be eagerly awaiting. It's here where the company outlines its worries, the issues that keeps it awake at night (or at least, stressed out in the boardroom).  Troubled investors are expecting Apple to say this: For the first time, sales of the iPhone are in decline.  According to the latest figures Apple has shared - from October - sales of the smartphone make up 63% of the company's entire revenue. That's before you factor in all the people who then go on to buy apps, subscribe to Apple Music, and do any number of other things with their phone from which Apple takes a cut.  Its other major products don't even come close. The Mac range has bucked a huge industry-wide decline but still only accounts for 13%. The iPad, meanwhile, represents 8% - though this may get a boost thanks to the recently launched iPad Pro, the bigger version that comes with a keyboard and little stylus.  Apple's major new product of recent times has been the Apple Watch. Yet we're still none-the-wiser about how successful that has been, as its performance is lumped into the "other" category, which includes sales of the iPod, Beats headphones and various other things.  Collectively, the "other" products were worth 6% in total.  The watch will have likely been a good performer at Christmas, so Apple may begin to shed some light on how well it is doing. But we'll have to wait and see.  The reliance on the iPhone is what worries investors most. Apple has plenty of repeat business - once hooked in, data shows people are far more likely to stick with Apple than change to another brand like Samsung - but it's now seeing a plateau when it comes to bringing in new customers.  Which is why China is so important.  Apple now makes more money in China than it does in the whole of Europe, and it's well on course to overtake the US.  "If China falls so does Apple," says Apple investor Daniel Ives, from FBR Capital Markets.  "They've really bet the house on the China growth opportunity."  Almost all of Apple's gains last year were thanks to Chinese expansion - new stores, and new customers who, until fairly recently, had to make do with awful knock-off imitations of the real deal.  But instability in the Chinese economy has rocked global markets. If China continues underperforming, it may be hard for Apple to continue that growth long-term.  But for the majority of investors and analysts, China doesn't represent a problem - yet.  It's still likely to be Apple's huge growth opportunity throughout 2016.  Case in point: there's currently only 30 Apple stores across the whole of China. California has 53.  Data suggests Apple's primary target in China, the middle classes, are still emptying their pockets with glee - particularly when it comes to buying Apple products.  Trying to predict Apple's future is a dangerous habit.  It rarely ends well - just ask ex-Microsoft boss Steve "the-iPhone-is-not-a-good-email-machine" Ballmer. And everyone at Blackberry. And Nokia.  But speculate we must, and here's a summary for what investors and analysts think could happen in 2016.  And then there's one word that would send Apple's shares soaring in an instant: car.  Rumours that Apple is making a car have gone from a murmur to shouts in the past six months.  Some predict Apple is looking at making a car, others say the company would be wiser to work with existing car makers to integrate Apple software - something which is already happening with CarPlay, a sort of slimmed down version of iOS designed for driving.  "It always goes back to can they come up with something as powerful as the iPhone," says Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Kantar Worldpanel ComTech.  "And I don't know if that is going to have to have us wait until the car comes out."  But she adds: "I don't think investors will ever be happy with Apple,"  "Because if they can do 10, they want 11. If they can do 11 they want 12."  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC and on Facebook	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35405479	Peers defeat government over child poverty reports	The government has lost a vote in the House of Lords on child poverty.  Peers voted by a majority of 92 to amend the Welfare Reform and Work Bill to make ministers report annually on income levels in the poorest families.  The move was spearheaded by the Bishop of Durham, Rt Rev Paul Butler, who argued income-related statistics must be recorded so they could be assessed with other measurements of deprivation.  Ministers say life chances are a better measure of economic outcomes.  The defeat could be overturned when the bill returns to the Commons later this year.  If it is not, ministers will be obliged to present a report to Parliament each year setting out the percentage of children in households whose net income is 60% to 70% below the median average.  The government's decision to change how child poverty is measured, to focus on the root causes of poverty rather than income disparities, has angered opposition parties and anti-poverty campaigners  But ministers insist that income benchmarks put in place by the last Labour government painted a false picture and meant that inter-generational factors holding families back, such as unemployment and low educational attainment, were ignored.  Bishop Butler said he conceded income levels should not be the only measure of levels of relative poverty but were still highly significant.  "It is also possible to understate the importance of income, or the lack of it, especially among those of us who have plenty," he said.  "There is also a wealth of academic evidence pointing to the damaging effect income poverty has on children's wellbeing, including their health, education and future employment prospects."  While he was not seeking to reinstate an income-based definition of child poverty, the bishop said his proposal would ensure income was measured and reported on an equal basis to other social indicators.  Ministers insist the move is not needed as income-related statistics would still be collated.  Welfare minister Lord Freud said, on their own, income figures were at best a "partial reflection" of an individual's economic wellbeing, and did not take into account levels of debt and savings, employment histories and increased school spending in areas of the highest deprivation.  During Monday's report stage debate on the Welfare Bill, ministers also announced that the government would be exempting recipients of carer's allowance from the overall household benefit cap, which is set to fall to a maximum of £20,000 outside London and £23,00 in the capital.  Lord Freud said the government valued the contribution carers made to society and was taking further steps to support them.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35404709	Syria: Pickles urges help for 'at risk' refugee children	Political pressure is continuing to grow on the government to take in thousands of unaccompanied refugee children who have made it into Europe.  Former cabinet minister Sir Eric Pickles said those "at risk" should be treated with "Christian spirit".  Former Children's Minister Tim Loughton said there was a strong humanitarian case to help those "in limbo".  Ministers say no decision has been made but charities want the UK to admit 3,000 minors from Syria and elsewhere.  Last year, an estimated 26,000 children arrived in Europe without their families.  Many had simply disappeared and were at risk of falling prey to people-traffickers, drug dealers and other abusers, Save the Children said.  The charity wants the UK to take in a further 3,000 unaccompanied children, in addition to the 20,000 refugees the UK has already pledged to take direct from refugee camps over the next five years.  Speaking in a debate in the House of Commons, Sir Eric, the former Communities and Local Government Secretary, who is now the UK's anti-Semitism envoy, said he was pleased the issue was being looked at again.  "He is quite right to try and keep children in the region, but to use the world's phrases, 'we are where we are', he said of Prime Minister David Cameron.  "There are children out there who are at risk, and I would urge the government to look carefully about this.  "After all this is 25 January - a month ago we were celebrating that great Christian festival of children, and I hope that that spirit lingers beyond Boxing Day."  Speaking after meeting interior ministers from other EU nations, in Amsterdam, Home Secretary Theresa May said Europe was "struggling to cope" and every nation needed to do its bit.  "Together with my counterparts from France and Germany, I made the case for urgent action, not just to deal with the immediate crisis, but also to resolve the situation in the longer term," she said.  "Unfortunately, what we've had is more talk than action.  "And we need urgently to work together to ensure that we can have proper processing at Europe's external borders, that we're returning illegal migrants, and that we're working up-stream in transit and origin countries."  On the issue of whether to prioritise child refugees, Mrs May said the UK's thinking would be driven by "the best interests of the child".  A "variety of options" was being examined, she added.  Earlier this month, Mr Cameron told the Commons he was considering the issue "in good faith", and the BBC understands he has yet to make up his mind whether to take more refugees.  Some warn taking in more lone children could lead to subsequent demands for their relatives to be brought to Britain - but Labour, the SNP and the Lib Dems are asking the UK to do more.  Raising the matter in an urgent question in the House of Commons, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said reception centres and children's homes in a number of European countries were overflowing and refugee children "disappearing".  "We hear rumours that the government will only be looking at helping child refugees from camps in the region," she said. "That is not enough."  In response, Home Office Minister James Brokenshire said the issue remained under review.  "Such a serious issue, potentially affecting the lives of so many, must be considered thoroughly, and no decisions have been taken yet," he said.  "The government is clear that any action to help and assist unaccompanied minors must be in the best interests of the child, and it is right that that is our primary concern."  Kent County Council has already warned it will not be able to accept any more unaccompanied children, saying its children's services are facing "enormous pressure" and have run out of foster beds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35403880	Obituary: Cecil Parkinson	As Conservative Party chairman in 1983, Cecil Parkinson was given much credit for his party's landslide election victory that year. But by the time of the party conference in the autumn, the scandal over his affair with his secretary Sara Keays - who was pregnant with his child - forced his dramatic resignation.  Cecil Parkinson was a political shooting star, who rose from humble beginnings to a point at which many saw him as a future prime minister - until the scandal that engulfed him.  He had previously succeeded as a businessman, a government minister and as the Conservative Party's most attractive, high-powered public relations man. He possessed charm, flair for organisation and political sophistication.  Born at Carnforth, in Lancashire, Cecil Parkinson was the son of a railwayman and in his youth he was left-wing, a pacifist and considered becoming a clergyman.  He attended the local grammar school before studying at Cambridge, where he graduated with a third in law. At this point his interest in politics seemed to have disappeared and he moved south to work in the City of London, where he became a chartered accountant.  It was his marriage - in 1957 to Ann Jarvis, the daughter of a rich builder in Harpenden, Hertfordshire - that pointed him in the direction of the Conservative Party. His wife was an ardent Conservative, and her father helped to set up Lord Parkinson in the business world.  Elected to Parliament in a by-election in 1970, he represented the constituency of Enfield West and subsequently Hertfordshire South and Hertsmere, seats which were affected by boundary redistributions.  In 1974 he was made a whip and promoted to spokesman on trade two years later. Following the party's election victory in 1979 he was appointed a junior minister at the Department of Trade.  At that point he was still virtually unknown outside Westminster and not that well-known inside it, but all that changed in 1981 when Mrs Thatcher made him party chairman - an appointment which catapulted him into the top ranks of the party.  He was also given the post of Paymaster General and a seat in the cabinet, and a year later he became chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.  These rapid promotions led many to see him as a pawn of the prime minister, especially when he was made a member of the "War Cabinet" during the Falklands crisis.  But he proved that he, better than anyone else, could go before the television cameras and - in a relaxed, reasonable and appealing manner - tell the nation what the government was up to; something he did to great effect.  Lord Parkinson's greatest triumph, however, was the 1983 election campaign, which was a model of discipline, timing, co-ordination and organisation. For this he was rightly given most of the credit, and when the new government was formed he was given the post of trade and industry secretary.  It was reported that Mrs Thatcher intended to make him foreign secretary as a reward for masterminding the victory, had it not been for what came next. His secret affair with Miss Keays, and the revelation that she was pregnant with his child, became public knowledge - during the Conservative Party's 1983 autumn conference.  He issued a statement admitting that he had offered to marry Ms Keays at one time, but added that he had later changed his mind, and was staying with his wife. He promised to make adequate financial arrangements for the child, and he firmly denied he was going to resign.  When he addressed the party conference he got a sympathetic, if somewhat lukewarm, reception. He seemed to have survived the storm.  But it was Ms Keays' statement to The Times - designed, she said, to "put the record straight" on their relationship - that ultimately resulted in his demise. It appeared on the final day of the conference, and revealed facts which Cecil Parkinson's statement had omitted. He immediately resigned his government post, though he remained an MP.  An influential figure with Mrs Thatcher, he was regarded as one of her close private friends. Over the next few years there were regular reports that she was anxious to bring him back into the government, but his return was opposed by some senior ministers.  It was probably delayed also by Sara Keays, who made sure she and her baby daughter remained in the public mind. She wrote a book, published in the autumn of 1985, giving details of her 12-year affair with Lord Parkinson, and implying that he had told her government secrets. Scotland Yard was asked to investigate, and later the Director of Public Prosecutions announced that no action was being taken.  Ms Keays's book was serialised in newspapers. She later gave magazine interviews and appeared on television. Lord Parkinson was also hit by another personal issue: his eldest daughter developed a heroin addiction.  However, he was re-elected in 1987 with an increased majority and brought back into the cabinet as energy secretary, to prepare the electricity industry for privatisation.  Two years later he took over transport, which had become something of a political hot seat, after much criticism of Paul Channon's handling of a series of rail and air disasters, and particularly airport security.  Almost inevitably he, too, suffered criticism, but he did manage to win from the Treasury a substantial increase in the money available for improving Britain's roads and railways.  One of his arch-critics was Labour's chief transport spokesman, John Prescott, whom Lord Parkinson denounced for his attitude to transport tragedies. He was a political vulture, he said, with an almost obscene passion for television appearances.  Lord Parkinson resigned as soon as John Major succeeded Mrs Thatcher as prime minister, but he said he was delighted the party had elected such a fine leader to succeed her, and promised him his total support from the backbenches.  Lord Parkinson stepped down as an MP in 1992 and was elevated to the House of Lords.  While that might have been expected to be the end of his career in frontline politics, he returned to the fray in 1997 when William Hague asked him to rerun his previous role of party chairman after their election defeat.  But in the end that role - where two of the younger Conservatives who worked for him were George Osborne and David Cameron - only lasted until 1999 when he retired and, barring the occasional media interview, was rarely back in the political spotlight.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35403445	Ex-Conservative chairman Cecil Parkinson dies aged 84	Cecil Parkinson has died aged 84 after what his family said was "a long battle with cancer".  As Conservative Party chairman under Margaret Thatcher in the early 1980s, he played a key role in the Tories' 1983 general election victory.  Lord Parkinson quit the cabinet soon after when it emerged his ex-secretary Sara Keays was carrying his child.  Prime Minister David Cameron said he was "a man of huge ability" who had helped transform the UK in the 1980s.  Paying tribute in Downing Street, Mr Cameron said he had "learnt a lot" from Lord Parkinson at the start of his political career, describing him as part of "a great political generation that really did extraordinary things for our country".  As they confirmed his death, a family spokesman said: "We shall miss him enormously. As a family, we should like to pay tribute to him as a beloved husband to Ann and brother to Norma, and a supportive and loving father to Mary, Emma and Joanna and grandfather to their children.  "We also salute his extraordinary commitment to British public life as a member of parliament, cabinet minister and peer - together with a distinguished career in business."  The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said Cecil Parkinson was one of Margaret Thatcher's closest political allies but said that his career was "undone" by the scandal that engulfed him following his affair with Ms Keays.  The former chartered accountant and businessman was central to Margaret Thatcher's political agenda and achievements in office, he added.  Lord Parkinson was in the front rank of Conservative politics for three decades, first being elected to Parliament in 1970.  After becoming a junior minister after Margaret Thatcher's 1979 election victory, he swiftly rose through the ranks and was named party chairman and elevated to the cabinet in 1981. He was a member of the war cabinet during the 1982 Falklands conflict.  He was tipped to be named foreign secretary after overseeing the Tories' landslide election victory in 1983. But he was given the more junior role of trade and industry secretary and it later emerged he had fathered a child with his former secretary, prompting him to resign in October 1983.  Former Conservative cabinet minister Michael Portillo said this scandal had "definitely held back his career" but the fact that he was offered a cabinet post at all was testament to his closeness to the PM.  Former foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind said Lord Parkinson would have been "the most natural candidate" to succeed Margaret Thatcher had events not turned out in the way they did.  "John Major eventually filled the gap that Cecil Parkinson would have had," he told the BBC News Channel. "But Cecil Parkinson was in reality a Thatcherite while John Major, as Margaret Thatcher eventually discovered, was not nearly as close to her, as she had hoped and assumed".  The former prime minister regarded Cecil Parkinson as "one of us", Mr Rifkind added: "He shared her views, thoughts and ideas. She was comfortable with him and had confidence in him, In addition, at a personal level, he was able to charm her."  After being brought back into government by Margaret Thatcher in 1987, Cecil Parkinson served as energy and transport secretaries.  He stood down as an MP in 1992 and was elevated to the House of Lords. He briefly made a comeback as Tory Party chairman, under William Hague, after the party's general election hammering in 1997.  Lord Hague described him as "an exceptional talent and an extraordinarily nice man to work with".  Current members of the government have also been paying tribute. Chancellor George Osborne tweeted: "Sad to hear of death of Cecil Parkinson. I worked with him when he was party chairman in 1997-8 - he was there in our hour of greatest need."  And former minister Alan Duncan said Lord Parkinson was "personable, amusing, easy-going and mischievously witty". "He started as Margaret Thatcher's great marketing man for overseas trade and turned into one of the great personalities of the Thatcher era," he said.  When the scandal over Cecil Parkinson's infidelity broke during the 1983 Conservative Party conference, Ms Keays claimed the politician had agreed to leave his wife Ann for her.  In her book, A Question Of Judgement, Ms Keays claimed that the then Mr Parkinson had "begged" her to have an abortion and that he had "haggled over every pound" of financial support for their daughter Flora.  But the Conservative politician insisted that he had voluntarily made more than adequate provision for Flora - who was diagnosed at an early age with learning disabilities and asperger's syndrome, and had an operation to remove a brain tumour when she was four.  In 1993, Cecil Parkinson and Sara Keays secured an injunction to prevent any information being published about Flora or her schooling until she turned 18. The court order was designed to protect her privacy but was later disowned by Miss Keays.  In an interview in 2002, after the gagging order had expired, Flora Keays said her father had "behaved very badly" towards her and her mother but hoped that one day he would become "part of our lives".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35402815	Labour 'in denial' about record warns election study	A review of why Labour lost the last election has suggested that the negative views of the party amongst swing voters were "deep and powerful".  The study, conducted by Gordon Brown's ex-pollster Deborah Mattinson, suggests voters believe Labour is "in denial" about its "appalling" economic record.  The findings suggest voters feel Labour is "in thrall to the undeserving".  Ms Mattinson has criticised the party's official report into its election defeat as a whitewash.  Labour said the Beckett report had "consulted far and wide", taking input from pollsters, pundits and academics, and would be acted upon.  The pollster undertook voter research to feed into Dame Margaret Beckett's report, which was published last week, but says her evidence was not published.  Her own review, commissioned by former deputy leader Harriet Harman, concludes Labour must now "atone for its past, especially on the economy", "be competent, especially on the economy" and "show it takes Scotland seriously".  It says Scots who voted SNP in 2015 see Labour as "indistinguishable from the Conservatives - just less competent".  It found that many English voters who voted Conservative in 2015 struggled to remember anything much about last year's general election campaign, although the televised debates were mentioned by most with David Cameron and the Tories seen as "repetitive and very bullish about the economy, whilst Ed Miliband was seen as a "dork", a view epitomised when he nearly fell off his podium at the end of one of the encounters.  The English voters said the Tories' assertion that Labour leader Ed Miliband, had he formed a government after the election, would have been bullied by SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon rang true because Mr Miliband was seen as "bumbling and weak".  The report says Labour must acknowledge its problems, develop policies which are "genuinely aspirational and inclusive", show it is "not being taken for a ride by scroungers" and has a "clear and credible line on immigration".  The report's research was conducted in marginal constituencies in Croydon, Watford, Nuneaton, Edinburgh and Glasgow. No-one who voted Labour in 2015 was involved, with those questioned including former Labour voters and Conservative and SNP supporters aged between 30 and 50.  Speaking on Sunday, Ms Mattinson told the BBC she was "very concerned" that lessons from the election would not be learned and was "somewhat disappointed" that her research was not more fully reflected in the Beckett report.  Ms Mattinson, founder and director of research and strategy consultancy Britain Thinks, said voters "didn't trust Labour to manage the economy" and they "categorically" blamed the party for the 2008 financial crisis.  She also said people did not see Labour leader Ed Miliband as "prime ministerial". "If you look at every election since the '70s, what you see is that the party that has the leader with the best ratings is the party that wins. There's no exception to that," she added.  The Beckett report identified four main factors for Labour's defeat - leadership, trust on the economy, a lack of traction on immigration and welfare and the fear of a minority Labour government being propped up by the SNP. It said Labour faced a "huge challenge" to win again in 2020.  However, it said assumptions that Labour lost the election because it was too left-wing and because its policies were unpopular were overly simplistic and should be treated with caution, adding that the manifesto was an "impressive document."	politics

The online service is a portal for customers to download games, e-books and other content on to Vtech devices.  They can now register, manage their accounts and use the app store, but some products, including the Power Xtra Laptop and InnoTV, remain offline.  Almost 6.4 million children's details were exposed by the hacker.  Other products which remain offline include the Secret Safe Diary Selfie, Snuggle and Sleep Musical Sheep and MobiGo Touch Learning System.  "After the cyber-attack, we have focused on further strengthening security around user registration information and other services within Learning Lodge," said Vtech chairman and group chief executive Allan Wong in a statement.  "With the key services now resumed, we strongly suggest that our existing customers log into Learning Lodge as soon as they can and change their passwords.  "We apologise that there are still some Learning Lodge services that remain unavailable at this time. We continue to work very hard towards reopening them as soon as possible."  Vtech confirmed at the time that the data accessed by the hacker included children's names, dates of birth and gender as well as the "name, email address, encrypted password, secret question and answer for password retrieval, IP address, mailing address and download history" of the account holder.  The hacker claimed to have acted to highlight the firm's vulnerability.  Some parents expressed anger that the service had not been restored in time for Christmas.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35399030	facts about broadband	What's the state of Britain's broadband infrastructure and would it be better if the dominant supplier BT was split up?  That is the big issue for the regulator Ofcom and, as its decision approaches, the political temperature is hotting up. What has been lacking from the debate so far is much independent research with some facts about where we stand now and how we compare internationally.  Now a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs, led by the former Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps, has made a contribution. They have signed a letter calling for BT's Openreach division to be split off, backed up by a major study of the market.  It's called "Broadbad" and makes a number of claims, notably:  The study is the work of something called the British Infrastructure Group, which has been created by Grant Shapps, and he is listed as the author. But within hours of it being published many of the key facts in the report have been questioned by those who have followed the broadband debate closely.  I've been speaking to Andrew Ferguson, who runs the consumer site thinkbroadband, and Carl Thomas, an IT specialist and superfast broadband campaigner, who published this critique of the report.  On the first claim, that 5,7 million people are not even getting 10Mbps, both say the figure is out of date. Grant Shapps has taken a May 2015 Ofcom study which shows 8% of households - that's 2.4 million - currently falling below that threshold, and multiplied that by the average UK household size of 2.37. But Mr Ferguson says his more recent research shows that figure is now down to 1.2 million homes and is continuing to fall as the superfast roll-out proceeds.  The second assertion - that BT has wasted £1.7bn of public money - will be seen sympathetically in those rural areas still waiting for the BDUK programme to deliver them superfast broadband. But again the claim looks overstated. BT has so far received only a third of that sum as the programme is still underway, and it has also been obliged to return some of the cash because take-up in some areas means that its broadband service is commercially viable.  But can we say the BDUK programme has already failed? It is worth pointing out that both Ofcom and the government of which Grant Shapps was recently a member insist that Britain is on track to deliver superfast broadband to 95% of households by 2017. Indeed, a year ago Mr Shapps said on a ministerial visit to Cumbria: "We've got now some of the best, if not the best coverage of superfast in Europe."  Which brings us to the third claim, that Britain is falling behind the rest of the world. That is demonstrably true when it comes to Japan and South Korea, but as Carl Thomas points out those are very different markets, where many people live in vast apartment blocks and governments are prepared to direct substantial funds into building infrastructure. A better comparison would be with our European neighbours, and there we appear to be doing well on coverage and competition, perhaps less well on headline speeds.  Of course the big question is, do we now need a radical change in the UK's broadband strategy and should that involve splitting off BT's Openreach division? BT's critics say its strategy of squeezing as much as it can out of its copper network instead of laying fibre direct to the premises will cost the UK dear in the longer run.  We need to examine what other countries are doing to see if lessons can be learned from the likes of Sweden and the Netherlands, which seem to be getting it right. There is also a live experiment underway in Hull where the local monopoly telecoms provider Kcom is promising fibre-to-the-home for everyone - though in the short term that means that the city ranks almost at the bottom of Mr Shapps' table of constituency broadband speeds because the programme is slower to roll out than BT's less ambitious strategy.  What is hard to know is whether an independent Openreach would change direction and invest more. Thomas says that it would still be a natural monopoly with shareholders who might be even less likely to sanction increased investment. But some competition economists believe that, as a part of BT, Openreach feeds some monopoly profits back to the parent group and these would instead be available for investment in fibre.  The arguments will continue but the pressure on Ofcom to act decisively is mounting. But it would be good to see the debate informed by more facts - and fewer assertions.	tech

The response showed that more than 51 workers were suspended.  However, only a minority were later dismissed or resigned.  The exact figure is not known because some councils did not specify how many of their employees had been punished.  The data also reveals 11 people were suspended for viewing online porn.  "Councils are clear that while some personal use of social media at work is acceptable, it must be reasonable and appropriate in terms of both the time spent and the content," said a spokesman for the Local Government Association.  "The vast majority of council employees abide by that.  "Councils take very seriously any misuse and, as these figures show, will deal robustly with cases that are unacceptable."  The statistics are not comprehensive because not all the councils included school staff in their replies.  In addition, some councils based their numbers on the calendar year while others used the April-to-March financial year.  Furthermore, only 169 councils provided data. Twenty-two refused and 27 did not reply to the FOI request.  But based on the information provided, 114 council staff were issued with warnings about breaching social media guidelines last year, which was a drop of 4% on 2014.  However, because a higher proportion of people were forced to take time off as a result, there was a 19% rise in the number of suspensions.  The responses also revealed 11 council staff were suspended over the period for accessing pornographic sites.  That marked a 27% fall on the previous year.  In one case, Orkney Council said there had subsequently been a related criminal investigation.  In another, Redbridge Council said the employee had stored "grossly offensive material in council systems" that could have brought it into disrepute.  UK audiences can hear the full story on BBC Radio 5 live Daily with Adrian Chiles at 10:00 GMT.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35395464	Call to admit refugee children 'considered' by government	The government is looking at calls to take in thousands of unaccompanied refugee children who have made it into Europe, a Cabinet minister says.  Charities have been calling on the UK to admit 3,000 child refugees as part of its response to the migrant crisis.  International Development Secretary Justine Greening said ministers were considering "whether we can do more" for unaccompanied children.  Downing Street sources say no decision has been made yet.  Speaking on Sky News, Ms Greening said children "have always been at the heart of our response".  Asked about the calls for the government to consider admitting 3,000, she said: "That's what we are doing and I think that is the right thing."  Last year it was estimated that around 26,000 children arrived in Europe without their families.  Many simply disappear after they arrive and are at risk of falling prey to people-traffickers, drug dealers and other abusers, the Save the Children said.  Calls for the UK to take in 3,000 unaccompanied children would be in addition to the 20,000 refugees the UK has already pledged to take direct from refugee camps over the next five years.  Ms Greening's comments come after David Cameron told the Commons earlier in January that he was considering the issue "in good faith".  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron - who has been pushing the PM for Britain to take in unaccompanied children - told the BBC "there may be some signs" from Mr Cameron's responses in recent months that his view was "moving in that direction".  But BBC political correspondent Iain Watson says the prime minister has apparently not yet made up his mind whether to take more refugees.  He knows he could be on the brink of a referendum campaign where immigration is a major issue, our correspondent says.  Some are warning of the risks of taking in more lone children, suggesting this could lead to subsequent demands for their relatives to be brought to Britain.  But Labour's leadership is urging Mr Cameron to do more.  They say if he helps his European partners tackle the migration crisis they could then give him a better deal on Europe to take to the British people, our correspondent adds.  Yvette Cooper, chair of Labour's refugee taskforce, said it was "good news that the government seems to be responding" to calls to help unaccompanied refugee children.  "But we are hearing some concern that the government may only be planning to help children within camps near Syria, and excluding those alone in Europe," she added.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn made similar calls on Saturday on a trip to see refugees in Dunkirk.  Alasdair Roxburgh from charity Save the Children told BBC Radio 5live: "We'd need to make sure they were protected and safe but we would be looking at foster families or other appropriate care. The UK is very capable of doing this."  Kent County Council has already warned it will not be able to accept any more unaccompanied children, saying its children's services are facing "enormous pressure" and have run out of foster beds.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35395469	Frank Field: Labour 'going in opposition direction to voters'	Labour's leadership is heading "in the opposite direction to where voters are" on big issues, an ex-minister says.  Frank Field said Jeremy Corbyn was in touch on "economic injustices" but warned of an electoral "walloping" over security and migration.  Mr Corbyn is against Britain's nuclear weapons system and has called on the UK to accept more refugees.  Meanwhile, a former Labour pollster has criticised the party's report into why it lost the election.  Deborah Mattinson told the BBC's Sunday Politics her research had not been included in the review, led by Dame Margaret Beckett, and branded it a "whitewash and a massive missed opportunity".  Labour said the Beckett report had "consulted far and wide", taking input from pollsters, pundits and academics.  In a Sunday Telegraph article, they call for an end to the UK's "open-door policy", warning of a risk to social cohesion unless immigration is reduced.  He told Sky News: "On the big issues, sadly, which will decide the next election, which is about defending our borders and defending us as a nation, the Labour opposition looks as if it is walking in the opposite direction.  "Clearly that is going to have to be sorted out before the next election if we are not to get a walloping yet again."  Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics, Michael Dugher, who was sacked as shadow culture secretary in Mr Corbyn's reshuffle, said the Labour leader "faces a big test" in the May elections.  Mr Dugher said Mr Corbyn had to be given a chance because of his "huge mandate from party members", but said he had to show he could convert this into support from the public, including Conservative voters.  Speaking to John Pienaar on BBC Radio 5 Live, former front-bencher Chuka Umunna said May's elections would be "essential" but said Mr Corbyn was "elected by our members and he deserves a chance to show he can do it".  He also said it was "unfair" to call the report into Labour's election defeat a whitewash.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35384506	Employment and Support Allowance should not be cut	Disability groups have written an open letter to Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, urging him to abandon planned cuts to a key benefit.  The House of Lords will vote next week on government plans to cut £30 a week from Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) for some new claimants from 2017.  The letter says it will make it harder for disabled people to find work.  But the Department for Work and Pensions says the campaigners are "scare-mongering".  "[The letter] fails to acknowledge that existing claimants and those with the most severe disabilities will not be affected at all," a spokesman said.  From April 2017, ministers are intending to reduce the amount of money people in one category of ESA receive, taking approximately £30 a week from new claimants who are deemed to be capable of making some effort to find work.  The change will bring the benefit rate in line with Jobseeker's Allowance.  More than 30 charities and members of the Disability Benefits Consortium, including Mencap, Mind and Parkinson's UK, and three peers, including Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, the record-breaking Paralympian, signed the open letter to Mr Duncan Smith.  The letter said the change would "push sick and disabled people further away from work and closer to poverty".  "The government says this £30 disincentivises sick and disabled people from finding work, but it has so far offered no evidence for this claim," the letter said.  Ministers have struggled to control the cost of Employment and Support Allowance.  An analysis produced last summer by the Office for Budget Responsibility saw them once more increasing the forecast costs for ESA.  The official reason is that more people than expected are on the benefit, a consequence of an increasing number of people successfully appealing against a decision to deny them the benefit, and problems in processing fit-for-work tests that decide if claimants are eligible.  However, internal DWP documents I've seen previously suggest there is a belief in government that people are applying for ESA rather than Jobseeker's Allowance.  They get more money on ESA and the demands to apply for jobs aren't as great.  The planned reforms, for some new claimants in 2017, will bring the ESA benefit rate in line with Jobseeker's Allowance and provide more support for people to find a job, albeit with tougher conditions if they don't comply.  Ministers hope the reforms will save money and get more people into work.  Mind policy and campaigns manager Tom Pollard said: "There is a complete lack of evidence to show that stopping, or threatening to stop, someone's financial support is an effective approach.  "In fact, pressurising people with mental health problems to engage in activities under the threat of losing their benefit is counter-productive, causing additional anxiety, often making people more unwell and less able to work."  Jan Tregelles, Mencap's chief executive, said disabled people were telling the charity "loud and clear" that the cut to ESA "will make their lives harder, with both their health and chances of returning to work being harmed".  A DWP spokesman said the government was "committed to ensuring that people have the best support possible".  "The current system needs reform because it fails to provide the right incentives, and acts to trap people on welfare," the spokesman said.  "The truth is that ESA sanctions are falling, and are only used as a last resort for the tiny percentage of people who don't take up the help on offer - fewer than 1% in any given month."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35384041	Labour to be investigated over late 'Ed Stone' receipts	The Labour Party is to be investigated for being late in submitting receipts for its widely-mocked "Ed Stone".  The Electoral Commission confirmed it has now received two invoices for the monument, which listed the party's election pledges, totalling £7,830.  They include £1,575 haulage costs, and £270 for a stone mason to erect it.  Labour blamed an "admin error" for failing to submit the invoices before data of 2015 election spending by all the parties was revealed this week.  Much of the subsequent reporting of the various parties' election campaign spending highlighted that the "Ed Stone costs" had not been revealed. Labour said there had been an "administrative error" and that it would be quickly rectified.  The Electoral Commission has said it will investigate the late submission.  The maximum sanction the Electoral Commission is able to impose for a breach of the rules is £20,000.  Ed Miliband unveiled the 8ft stone carving on the final weekend of the 2015 General Election campaign, saying that it would be installed in the garden of Downing Street to remind the party of its duty to honour its six main election promises.  The move was met with near universal derision and what happened to what became known as the "Ed Stone" has been unclear. Various unconfirmed reports have suggested it is in a warehouse in London or has been destroyed.  The Electoral Commission told the BBC that it would be looking into the issue of the receipts being submitted late "in line with its policy".  It was unable to confirm how long the investigation might take, saying sometimes it has to go back and ask for more information, and each incident is dealt with on a case by case basis.  Spending on the stone was not included in the Electoral Commission data released on Wednesday.  Labour said at the time: "Due to an administrative error these invoices were not included with other items of campaign spend. We have informed the Electoral Commission and will seek to rectify this error as soon as possible."  Labour spent £12m on the campaign, the watchdog's figures show, compared with £15.5m spent by the Conservatives.  In total, £39m was spent by the UK's six largest parties on the campaign, an increase on the £34.4m spent in 2010 but lower than the record £42m spent in 2005.  Although comfortably outspending Labour over the regulated period - between 23 May 2014 and 7 May 2015 - the Conservatives spent less than in 2010, when their budget was £16.6m. In contrast, Labour spent more than in 2010, when their total outlay was £8m.  A breakdown of the figures show the Conservatives spent 27.7% of their budget on "unsolicited material", such as flyers, and 23.2% on advertising while Labour spent 61% of their budget on "unsolicited material" and 7.6% on advertising.  Spending on rallies accounted for 13% of Labour's total expenditure compared with the Conservatives' 5% while the Conservatives spent 30.1% of their budget on market research and canvassing, against Labour's 7.7% outlay.  The Conservatives spent £1.2m on advertising on Facebook in the year before the poll while Labour spent just over £16,000.  The figures do not cover some administrative spending, for instance on staff, while spending by individual candidates is reported separately.  The SNP reported the biggest rise in spending compared with 2010, when their expenditure totalled £316,000. In contrast, the Lib Dems' spending fell from £4.7m in 2010 to £3.5m last year.  The UK Independence Party spent £2.8m while the Greens spent £1.1m. UKIP spent the least per vote gained while the SNP spent least per MP won.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35384808	Labour's Dan Jarvis on Corbyn, leadership and modelling	Labour's Dan Jarvis meets me at Barnsley station and gives me a brief tour of the town before we settle in a local café for lunch.  He's suited, short back and sides, polite, and incredibly enthusiastic about his constituency. He tells me that whenever he walks into the House of Commons he reminds himself that he's there to speak up for his constituents.  "I'm a doer I like to get things done and there's so much to do," he says.  He wasn't widely known beyond Westminster until he shot to fame after last May's general election.  Labour lost; Ed Miliband resigned; and he found himself the hot favourite to win a leadership contest. Over a couple of days he was pursued by "Dan fans" and dogged by reporters and film crews as he considered whether or not he should stand.  Listen to Becky's interview with Dan Jarvis on BBC Radio 4's PM at 17:00 GMT  Why you? I ask him. To his credit he doesn't take offence.  "I don't know. I mean there had been a bit of gossip and speculation before the election… some people were quite forceful in the way that they suggested I put myself forward."  But in the end he decided against standing, saying "it wasn't the right thing for my family at that moment".  His two eldest children lost their mother, his first wife Caroline, to cancer in 2010.  He tells me: "These are just the most unspeakable, appalling times when you have young kids you don't have the luxury of going into yourself, because you've got to keep the show on the road.  "For myself, if I'm being sort of brutally honest about it, I think that I'm probably at my best when my back is against the wall, when you kind of suffer a bereavement you suffer that kind of tragedy, there's a huge pressure that comes from it, and you can either sink or you can swim… and I decided to start swimming."  He left the army - he was a major in the Parachute Regiment - and stood for Labour in the Barnsley Central by-election, and won.  He has revisited his decision not to go for the Labour leadership in a recent interview for the Guardian newspaper.  "I'm not a great one for regretting anything, but what I do regret is that I didn't give it more thought beforehand," he says.  More recently, speculation revved up again about his leadership ambitions and he was accused of being disloyal.  He rejected the criticism, telling me that he has never and will never criticise Jeremy Corbyn.  "It's not my style", he says.  I ask him about his leadership ambitions. "I don't lie awake at night thinking about it, I think what I've come to know is you never know what's around the corner, and you have to be ready for anything.  "My focus is getting on with job as the MP for Barnsley Central."  He adds: "If people say you bottled it, it doesn't affect you. Well it doesn't affect me, because it's just nonsense."  We order our lunch, he has a full English Breakfast, he won't need to eat again today, I say.  He grins. "I probably will though".  He's wary of talking about his military career, he doesn't want it to define him and worries he might be accused of showing off.  He served in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Iraq and Afghanistan and lodged in his skull is a small fragment of shrapnel.  Rather than the military adventures - which I am fascinated by - what he wants to talk about is his vision for the Labour Party and how they can win the next election.  He says the party has a mountain to climb, but he's optimistic. It comes down to two very simple things, he says: "You've got to have credible people and credible policies and ideas."  I ask if Mr Corbyn and shadow chancellor John McDonnell are the credible people he is talking about.  "In the end it doesn't matter what I think, because it's for the public to decide."  So, does he believe the public thinks they are credible?  "Look, I think that Jeremy is a really decent guy, many of the things that Jeremy talks about resonate with millions of people, the challenge for him and for all is, basically, now, to take it out to the country, because our membership is incredibly important.  "But it represents just a slither of the population and in the end we've got to convince the public that we are credible - and if we don't we will lose again."  I order us more tea and I ask Dan straight: Is Jeremy Corbyn a future prime minister?  "I hope so," he says.  We have a chat about his near death experience on Snowden, being stranded in remote Nepal, with his military mate David, who is now an international male model, and how he refused to hand over his wallet to a mugger.  He glances at his watch and can't believe the time: "My office will be fainting because they've lost track of me for about three weeks."  His best mate Dave, living the high life as an international male model. Fast cars, fancy do's.  Does he ever think he pulled the short straw? Oh no, he is the lucky one, he answers, the one who is privileged and honoured.  When he falls silent, I tell him I think it sounds quite exciting.  And after a pause - and it might be the first time he really lets down his guard - he laughs. "Yeah it does, doesn't it?"	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35381544	Week ahead	It's a week of fairly humdrum legislating for MPs and peers, but there are at least three major legislative events lurking in the background, and we might get some hints about their timing.  If the forthcoming EU summit goes according to David Cameron's plans, there may well be a vote to set the date of the EU membership referendum (three statutory instruments setting out the timing and ground rules for the campaign are expected to arrive pretty soon).  Judging by the heavy hints being dropped at the despatch box, a vote to renew the Trident nuclear submarines cannot be far away...and the biggest bill of this parliament - what promises to be a 500-clause behemoth on Investigatory Powers - is also coming soon. A joint committee of MPs and peers under Labour former Northern Ireland Secretary Lord Murphy is due to report on a draft version of the bill soon, and Theresa May is expected to launch it at second reading early in March.  This week's crop of private members' bills could see the final demise of Lord Saatchi's attempt to create a more permissive climate for innovative medical treatments, which has surfaced in both Houses in various incarnations in recent years. And watch out for Lord Wills' Hillsborough-inspired Public Advocate Bill - which launches an important idea for the handling of future inquiries into major disasters.  Here's my rundown of the week ahead:  The Commons meets at 2.30pm for Education questions - and there will be an extra member of the Labour team facing the Education Secretary, Nicky Morgan. In her new, cross-cutting role as shadow cabinet minister for mental health, Luciana Berger will be there to put a question from the frontbench. And the following week she will pop up at Work and Pensions questions to quiz Iain Duncan Smith. This is a minor Commons innovation - I can't think of a previous instance of a floating shadow minister….  As usual, there's a good chance that post-weekend urgent questions or ministerial statements will follow.  Then MPs will turn to the detailed report stage consideration of the Childcare Bill - the bill to increase in the entitlement to free childcare from 15 to 30 hours a week (for 38 weeks of the year) for working parents of three and four-year-old children in England. There are several amendments requiring regular reports on child health and other issues. Labour backbencher Jess Phillips wants to add a requirement that victims of domestic violence, who have left paid employment to escape it, should continue to be eligible for 30 hours of free childcare per week.  In Westminster Hall, the Petitions Committee has scheduled a debate on an e-petition calling for the government to "scrap plans forcing self-employed and small business to do four tax returns".  In the Lords (from 2.30pm) the main event is the first day of report stage debate on the Welfare Reform and Work Bill - where much of the debate may focus on reporting measures. My eye was caught by an amendment from disability campaigners Baroness Campbell of Surbiton and Lord Low of Dalston requiring an annual report to Parliament on progress towards halving the disability employment gap, and by the amendment from the Bishop of Durham, Labour's Baroness Sherlock and the Crossbencher Lord Listowel, requiring an annual report on child poverty. The Crossbencher Lord Ramsbotham has another on maternal nutrition and poverty - and one of more of these amendments could be pushed to a vote. Issue on life chances, the benefit cap and benefit freeze will also be debated.  And there is also likely to be a vote on a Regret Motion from Labour's Lord Stevenson on the Education (Student support) Regulations - which Labour had tried to strike down in the Commons.  The Commons meets at 11.30am for Justice questions, to be followed by a ten minute rule bill on Profit-sharing and Company Governance (Employees Participation) from Labour's Gareth Thomas.  MPs will then polish off the Legislation Charities (Protection and Social Investment) Bill, which provides stronger protection for charities in England and Wales from people who are unfit to be charity trustees; equips the Charity Commission with new or strengthened powers to tackle abuse of and gives charities a new power to make social investments.  In Westminster Hall, the debates are on the potential role of UK manufacturing in development of onshore oil and gas (9.30am- 11am); child poverty (11am -11.30am); further education colleges in the North East (2.30pm-4pm): Congolese refugee camps in East Africa (4pm-4.30 pm) and the funding of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service (4.30pm-5.30pm).  In the Lords (from 2.30 pm) the first business is the introduction of the Lord Bishop of Newcastle, Christine Hardman, who will be the second female bishop to enter the Lords under the terms of the Lords Spiritual (Women) Act 2015. The first female bishop was introduced in October - Rachel Treweek of Gloucester - to spontaneous applause in the chamber.  After the usual half hour of questions, peers will deal with Commons amendments to the Psychoactive Substances Bill - no votes are expected because the government have conceded on the issue on which they were defeated at report stage: making supplying legal highs in prison an aggravated offence.  The day's major event will be second reading of the Housing and Planning Bill, where the sky will be dark with markers going down for cross-party attempts to amend the bill later in its consideration. Key figures may be Crossbenchers Lord Best (a former Chief Executive of the National Housing Federation) and Lord Kerslake (the former Permanent Secretary at the Department for Communities and Local Government). The big issues in the bill include starter homes, self-built homes, rogue landlords, abandoned premises, right to buy from housing associations, high value housing association property, high income social tenants, neighbourhood and local planning, registers of land, planning permission, nationally significant development projects and compulsory purchase.  The Commons opens at 11.30 am with half an hour of Cabinet Office questions, followed at noon Prime Minister's Question Time.  The main debate is on a Labour motion on the threat to specialist accommodation for the most vulnerable from housing benefit cuts contained in the small-print of the Chancellor's autumn statement.  Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey and the shadow work and pensions secretary Owen Smith are seeking to put pressure on the government over what they describe as a "catastrophic" cuts and they're calling for the Chancellor, George Osborne, to abandon them, publish a full impact assessment and consult with housing providers.  In Westminster Hall the subjects for debate are changes to funding of support for disabled people (9.30pm - 11am); cash retentions in business transactions (11am - 11.30am); resettlement of Syrian refugees (2.30pm - 4pm); late payments to small businesses (4pm - 4.30 pm) and finally, and Richard Benyon's debate (4.30pm - 5.30pm) on the Iraq Historic Allegations Team.  In the Lords (from 3pm) it's the report stage of the Welfare Reform and Work Bill, where the main issues in play are exemptions from the two child limit, ESA, workplace conditionality, Universal Credit, Housing Benefit, and possibly support for mortgage interest and social housing rents exemption.  Watch out for the one-hour mini debate on the House of Lords Press Office. Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts will suggest that the House needs to set up a rapid rebuttal unit to combat inaccurate stories about it (the recent coverage of the Lord Speaker's expenses and last year's story that peers wanted their catering service to provide better champagne that was on offer in the Commons, are two examples pointed at).  The Commons meets at 9.30am for Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business statement from the Leader of the House.  The day's main debate, chosen by the Backbench Business Committee is another interesting backbench excursion into high-level health policy, following on from the previous week's on child obesity. This time a trio of health policy heavyweights, former coalition ministers Norman Lamb (Lib Dem) and Dan Poulter (Conservative), together with Labour's Liz Kendall, will push for a commission on the NHS and social care, to examine ways of tearing down the institutional walls between two services which need to work closely together. Mr Lamb produced a Ten Minute Rule Bill on this issue, and was startled at the warmth of his reception.  In the Lords (from 11am), the main debates are on subjects chosen by backbench Lib Dem peers. First is local democracy in the United Kingdom, led by Lord Shipley, one of the legion of senior Lib Dem councillors now in the Lords.  Then Baroness Uddin (now a non-affiliated peer) leads a debate on the topical subject of promoting English language classes for women to address isolation and extremism - and the Lib Dem Baroness Sharp of Guildford raises the role of adult education and lifelong learning in developing the skills needed to strengthen the United Kingdom economy.  Peers will also be asked to approve two Church of England measures. First, the Safeguarding and Clergy Discipline Measure, which strengthens the powers of bishops and others to suspend and discipline people holding positions in the church on safeguarding grounds - the Church believes it needs to improve its arrangements to prevent the abuse of children and vulnerable adults within the church community, and to deal effectively with those in authority them.  There's also the Diocesan Stipends Funds (Amendment) Measure - which makes some technical changes to the investment rules for Church funds. The verdict of Parliament's Ecclesiastical Committee, which considered both measures expedient recently, can be found here.  Its private members' bill day in both Houses - the Commons kicks off (9.30am) with the report stage of Chris Heaton-Harris's Access to Medical Treatments (Innovation) Bill.  This aims to create a database of innovative medical treatments, to help NHS practitioners see what has been tried and what has worked. But it also included the "Saatchi Bill" proposals to protect doctors from negligence claims if they tried innovative treatments for serious illnesses - critics called this the "quacks' charter").  It looks as if the Saatchi Bill element will be dropped, but there will also be an important addition in the shape of amendments to facilitate the licensing of off-patent drugs to treat illnesses other than the one they were originally licenced for. New uses are often found for well-established drugs, but if their patent has expired, it's often not worth the manufacturer going through an expensive licensing process - a Labour MP Nick Thomas Symonds saw his bill to create a new licensing mechanism for this purpose talked out in the Commons in November.  But that raised such a stink that ministers now seem keen to revisit the issue - so look out for some amendments to this bill, and more particularly for policy announcements that the minister is expected to give at the despatch box.  Then, if there's much time left, we are into second reading debates on an assortment of bills which are well down the list and have little priority for debate, and, this late in the Parliamentary year, have little chance of becoming law: Peter Bone's Child Victims of Human Trafficking (Central Government Responsibility) Bill reflects his years of campaigning on human trafficking issues. Labour's Kerry McCarthy has her Food Waste (Reduction) Bill, and central London MP Karen Buck has bills on Basement Excavation and Homes (Fitness for Human Habitation). I doubt we'll make it to the former minister Tim Loughton's Civil Partnership Act 2004 (Amendment) Bill - which aims to allow heterosexual couples to formalise their relationships in civil partnerships.  Over in the Lords (from 10am) the first business is detailed consideration of Lord Empey's Airports Act 1986 (Amendment) Bill - but what really caught my eye was the Labour former Justice Minister Lord Wills' Public Advocate Bill. This has an interesting backstory. Lord Wills was the minister who devised the mechanism which allowed a new look at the evidence on the Hillsborough disaster and his bill would create a public advocate who could represent the families of people killed in a disaster, in any subsequent inquiry.  There's also the Road Traffic Act 1988 (Alcohol Limits) (Amendment) Bill from Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe and the Age of Criminal Responsibility Bill from Lord Dholakia.	politics

Refunds will be available immediately, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).  Electrical faults in hoverboards have been responsible for a number of fires across the United States.  The CPSC is currently investigating 13 hoverboard manufacturers over safety issues.  Contrary to the name, hoverboards do not float but provide a wheeled form of self-balancing transport.  Previously, Amazon had stopped selling models in response to questions over their safety.  "I expect other retailers and manufacturers of hoverboards to take action and offer a full refund now to their customers as well," said CPSC chairman Elliot F Kaye in a statement.  "I also expect responsible large-volume online sellers in particular to stop selling these products until we have more certainty regarding their safety.  A charging hoverboard was recently cited as the cause of a fire that destroyed a family home in Melbourne, Australia.  In the UK in December, National Trading Standards said that 88% of hoverboards examined by the body since October 2015 could explode or catch fire.  "The main problem that all of these other hoverboards, that you've been seeing, have is that they use very poor quality components in an effort to bring their costs down," Peter Treadway, chief executive of skateboard firm Blink, told the BBC during an interview at CES in January.  Besides fire hazards, the CPSC chairman also cited increasing reports of serious injuries to hoverboard users in falls associated with the devices.  A London teenager, aged 15, who was riding a hoverboard died in December after he was hit by a bus.  The CPSC recommends that hoverboard users keep a working fire extinguisher nearby when charging or using the devices and that they be charged only in open areas away from flammable materials.  Its investigation into a range of hoverboard makes has not yet resulted in any specific determinations about their safety, the CPSC said.	tech

Language was spelled "langauge" in the original release, put out on Thursday.  But it was corrected by officials after Twitter users ridiculed the error.  BBC Radio 4 presenter Anita Anand said it was "beyond parody" that the Home Office could not spell language in a note to migrants who have been told to learn English.  The Home Office has been contacted for a response.  On Monday, Prime Minister David Cameron announced a £20m fund to teach Muslim women in the UK to speak English, claiming it would help tackle segregation and help them resist the lure of extremism.  But some Muslims have accused him of wrongly conflating the two issues.  Mr Cameron said all those who entered the UK on the five-year spousal settlement programme - not just Muslim women - would have to sit language tests after two and a half years.  Thursday's press release said the new requirement would not be implemented before October 2016, with the precise timing and further details to be confirmed by the Home Office "in the next few weeks".	politics

Here's what we are looking at this week.  It's the world's oldest industry and one you might not think was that forward-looking - but farming is undergoing a whole new data-driven revolution. From drones giving aerial surveys of crops, to combine harvesters measuring precisely the output of every square metre, or sensors giving minute-by-minute updates on the health of animals, farmers are handling an ever growing flood of data. We will be hearing from a chicken farmer who is adapting to this new way of working and our special guest is Rob Carter, the co-founder of Field Margin which aims to help farmers navigate their data via a smartphone app. By the way, our colleagues on BBC Radio 4's Farming Today have been covering technology and farming all week and have a special report on Saturday morning's On Your Farm.  Since Microsoft bought Minecraft we've heard very little about its plans for the hugely popular world-building game. But this week the software giant announced a big push into education, launching a classroom version of the game. Our Jane Wakefield went along to BETT, the UK's giant educational technology show, to talk to Microsoft about the plan which allows children to learn through Minecraft at school and then continue to play at home. Schools will need to have an Office 365 account to log in to the education edition - we'll be asking whether this is part of Microsoft's strategy to battle Google as the prime software provider in the classroom.  When the Zano mini-drone project crashed to earth last November, Kickstarter came in for a lot of criticism from the backers who had lost out. So the crowdfunding platform commissioned an investigative reporter to find out what went wrong. This week Mark Harris published his 13,000 word report, which is both an excruciating account of how not to run a technology business and a warning for anyone who does not understand that backing a crowdfunded project is not like ordering something from Amazon. We talk to him on the programme about where he thinks this leaves crowdfunding as a way of getting tech ideas off the ground.  Twenty three years after the legendary game Doom came out, it still has a dedicated community of players, and they have something to celebrate this week. The first new level since the mid-1990s has been released by one of the original developers John Romero. Our reporter Zoe Kleinman has been talking to him - he admits he was nervous about how the community would react but most fans have been positive.  Tune in to the BBC World Service at 15:00 GMT for all that and more or catch the podcast later.	tech

A transcript of court proceedings from a copyright lawsuit against Google allegedly contains reference to a deal between the Silicon Valley firms.  The alleged agreement involves Google paying Apple a percentage of revenue - as much as 34% - gained through iOS devices.  The BBC has not been able to verify the claims independently.  Bloomberg added that the referenced document has since been removed from the web.  "The transcript vanished without a trace from electronic court records at about 15:00," the report noted.  The court proceedings in question regard a lawsuit by Oracle Corp. in which the firm claims that Google used its Java software to develop Android but failed to pay for it.  Analyst firms, such as Morgan Stanley, have quoted the $1bn figure in the past, but this appears to be the first time that a reference has been found in court documents.  "It's a very lucrative business to be the browser of choice on a device or the search engine on a device," Chris Green, a technology analyst at consultancy firm Lewis, told the BBC.  "It really does, I think, highlight the importance that's being put on being able to own real estate and the conduits through which people access information."  However, Mr Green also noted that it was generally quite common for companies to pay hardware vendors fees for the placement of software and services on devices and that sometimes that may indeed be a percentage of revenue gained as a result.  Other details about how Google manages its services emerged this week - including the fact that the firm removed 780 million "bad" advertisements from its sites last year.  By bad, Google said it was referring to ads which linked to malware, promoted fake goods or covered up website content.  In a blog post, the company said it had more than 1,000 people within its organisation responsible for weeding out these ads and that the number that had to be removed was increasing.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35377323	How a bare-knuckle battle could play out	The government's latest defeat in the House of Lords could put the Business Secretary, Sajid Javid, under some pressure to save key elements of the Trade Union Bill.  Wednesday's vote was on an innocuous-looking motion to set up a special select committee to examine the sections of the bill dealing with political funding by unions and report by the end of February.  This not only tees up the possibility of some unwelcome (to the government) amendments, perhaps directly suggested by that committee, perhaps inspired by its report. It also means ministers will be negotiating against the clock, if they try to strike them down.  Take a look at the timetable for the bill. It is due to have four days of committee stage consideration, starting on 8 February - and it won't end until 24 February at the earliest, even assuming no go-slows or cunning filibustering tactics.  Given the way the Lords phases its debates, this, in turn, means that the crucial report stage, - probably requiring two full days - can't finish before 14 March. This is the point at which serious amendments will be put to the bill, and after that, the third reading is held a week later.  Going by the voting on Wednesday, when the government was defeated by 327-234 votes - a stonking 93-vote majority - ministers can expect to suffer a number of defeats on a variety of issues, where Labour and the Lib Dems can mobilise their peers to vote through amendments.  Party funding is just one of the potential flashpoints: there may also be amendments on key sections dealing with strike ballots and the collection of union membership subscriptions. That means there's some serious parliamentary ping-pong in prospect.  Ping-pong is the process where the Commons has to consider the changes the Lords have made to the bill and either accepts or rejects them; if the Lords amendments are rejected the bill has to be sent back to Peers, and if they then have to decide to bow to the will of the elected House, or suggest further amendments, usually watering down their original amendments a bit.  It can go on for quite some time.  And by then the clock will be ticking towards the end of the parliamentary session late in May, and the dreaded legislative "washup". This is process by which all outstanding legislation is agreed - and it is the moment when the Lords enjoys its maximum power because if it has not agreed to a bill when the music stops and the Parliamentary Session ends, that bill is lost.  Faced with that prospect ministers usually strike deals. But even factoring in the Easter holidays, they may not feel they are in immediate danger. There should be several weeks for any changes their Lordships make to the Trade Union Bill to bounce between Lords and Commons. And, if necessary, ping-pong can happen immediately and intensively, as soon as Peers have given the bill its third reading.  Of course, the government's parliamentary business managers have plenty of cards to play. They could for example keep both Houses sitting through the night, or even through several nights, to get their way.  In Wednesday's vote, the crucial Crossbench vote was more or less evenly divided (remember the Crossbenchers don't have a party line, still less a whip) with 38 voting with the government and 44 against. But key figures like Lord Bew, who chairs the Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has warned against changes to party funding rules that only affect one main party, not the other, and the former mandarin, Lord Kerslake, have emerged as important players who could swing the debate.  I'm told the special select committee's already lining up key witnesses - and its report could be crucial in those report stage votes on the party funding clauses of the bill. But look out, also, for a big push to allow electronic voting in union ballots. I suspect this may be one of the few areas where the government might offer a concession.  The bottom line is that for Labour the loss of millions of pounds of political funding as a result of the changes proposed in this bill could destroy its ability to compete with the Conservative Party; so whatever the rights and wrongs of opting into, rather than out of, a political levy, this will be a bare-knuckle battle for very high stakes.  Even with its current woes, the Labour Party can unite against what it perceives as a tribal attack, so the Labour peers may not go gently into that good night.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35370234	Labour's McDonnell considers giving workers right to buy firms	A Labour government could give employees the right to take over their companies if they are sold, dissolved or floated on the stock market.  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says the party does not want to return to an era of widespread state ownership.  Instead, Labour would look to expand co-operatives and explore giving workers the "right to own".  David Cameron has accused Labour of wanting to turn back the clock to the days of state ownership and strikes.  But Mr McDonnell tackled this claim head-on in a speech in Manchester, saying Labour had to move on from its traditional belief that state ownership was always the answer.  "Whatever the achievements of the past, we cannot simply turn the clock back - whether to 1997, 1964, or 1945," he said.  At the last election, "the Tories talked relentlessly, overwhelmingly about the future. Labour, strikingly, did not".  "We cannot allow that to happen again. We cannot be small 'c' conservatives."  He added: "A future Labour government will end the current programme of spending cuts. We will protect what has already been won.  "But we must look beyond this point. We should be seizing the opportunity to create a fairer, more democratic society."  Labour has already announced its intention to return the railways to public ownership.  But when it comes to the wider economy, Mr McDonnell said Labour should "look elsewhere" for solutions, and draw on its tradition of supporting workers' co-operatives.  He signalled support for giving employees in companies which are about to be sold off - or floated on the stock exchange - the first option to purchase the company.  "The Tories have offered a Right to Buy, Labour would seek to better this. We'd be creating a new Right to Own," he said in a speech in Manchester.  He said the "biggest hurdle" facing co-ops and other small businesses was getting initial funding from high street banks.  "No other major developed economy has just five banks providing 80% of loans. We'd look to break up these monopolies, introducing real competition and choice.  "Regional and local banks, prudently run and with a public service mandate, have to be part of the solution here."  Mr McDonnell is also considering adopting the Italian government's policy of offering funding to help employee-owned enterprises to get off the ground.  "With consortium co-operatives providing an effective means for new businesses to share and reduce costs, we'd look to support these at a local level, working with local authorities, businesses and trade unions," he said.  He said the policy would be developed "over the next few years", adding: "In an uncertain world where a laissez faire market approach continues to fail, co-operation is an idea whose time has come again.  "This is the start of developing a new, positive economic alternative for Labour."  He also urged Labour to embrace opportunities offered by the internet and new technology.  "Technology is proving disruptive. It can have terrible downsides - de-skilling and an accelerated concentration of wealth.  "But it also opens up new possibilities - the explosion of sharing that the Internet can provide.  "There is an entrepreneurial spirit at work here: not the theatrical meanness and one-upmanship of Gordon Gekko, but a desire to create something better for us all."  Chief Secretary to the Treasury Greg Hands said Labour represented "a threat to our economic security".  He added: "Now we know the truth: Labour is planning another debt-fuelled spending spree and a huge tax bombshell on the businesses that have helped to drive Britain's recovery from the economic mess they left behind."	politics

Customers trying to buy tickets for the €12m (£9m) draw found themselves unable to do so for nearly two hours.  The jackpot was the largest in 18 months.  Premier Lotteries Ireland (PLI), the operator, has said the incident is under investigation.  During a DDoS attack, a website or online service's capacity to handle internet traffic is overloaded - usually by automated programs set to flood the site with requests.  The attack began at 11:21 GMT on Wednesday and lasted for about two hours.  Retail systems were brought back online by 12:45 GMT and the website by 13:25 GMT.  "They said you couldn't buy tickets from the ticket machines, which is really interesting, it's not just the website - it would be quite interesting to understand why that happened," said John Graham-Cumming at DDoS-protection company Cloudflare.  "This incident is still under investigation," a spokeswoman said.  "However, we can confirm that at no point was the National Lottery gaming system or player data affected."  Given the large jackpot involved, the lottery was experiencing high demand for tickets on Wednesday lunchtime.  The impact of the attack may well have been heightened by this, according to Igal Zeifman, senior digital strategist at cybersecurity company Imperva.  "As a rule, record-setting prizes and jackpots result in traffic spikes on lottery sites, and it is very common for DDoS attackers to strike during such predictable peak traffic times, especially when going after big targets," he said.	tech

The PM has told his cabinet colleagues to wait until he returns from Brussels with a reform deal before campaigning to leave or stay in the EU.  But he told an audience of global business leaders they should "get out there" and start making their case now.  He was speaking during a three-day visit to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.  Mr Cameron said he hoped to get agreement on his reform demands at an EU summit next month, paving the way for referendum later this year, but he was in "no hurry" if the deal was not right.  Prospects for a swift agreement were played down by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls, who said the negotiations had "only just begun" and warned that a deal "at any price" would not be acceptable.  Mr Cameron said his proposed welfare reforms were "absolutely crucial" to his hopes of getting a reform deal.  But he said he was open to other, "equally potent", welfare curbs if other EU nations refused to accept a four year ban on in-work benefits for new arrivals to the UK.  He said he would continue to push for reforms to the EU in the future even if Britain voted to remain in it - and stressed that he believed the UK could succeed outside the EU, but he said the question was "how will we be the most successful?"  Success in the renegotiation could deliver the UK "the best of both worlds" by allowing it to be within the single market while retaining control of its borders and remaining outside the single currency and the ever-closer union sought by some other member states.  He said it was "a prize worth fighting for" and one "I'm determined to deliver in this, my second term as prime minister" and he issued a plea to businesses and charities to get behind him.  "I would say don't hold back right now, even though the question isn't settled.  "I think that if business backs my reforms, if you want to see the competitive Europe, if you want to see the flexible Europe, if you want to see a Europe where you can be in the eurozone and win or out of the eurozone and win, I would argue 'Get out there and support those things'."  Mr Cameron explained why Britain was having a referendum - that it was "drifting away" from the EU and it had become increasingly unpopular with the British public.  He said he wanted to "secure the future of Britain in a reformed European Union" and to do this by securing "full and democratic support" for membership from the public.  Meanwhile, in London, Downing Street said a cabinet meeting would be held "soon after" any deal was agreed - following concerns a delay could assist the campaign to remain in the EU.  Some ministers had raised concerns that a delay to holding a cabinet meeting would give Mr Cameron the opportunity to set out his case for the deal without being challenged.  However, Number 10 said a cabinet meeting would be held "in good order" after any agreement, but said it could not guarantee a day or time.  Liz Bilney, chief executive of Leave.EU, said: "The fact that the prime minister is begging for international corporations to stick their noses into our democratic process only shows how little he and the elite care for ordinary British citizens."  Matthew Elliot, who heads Vote Leave, suggested Mr Cameron's speech was aimed at big business but it was "the smaller businesses who are most hurt by EU regulation".  CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn said: "The majority of CBI members want the UK to be in a reformed EU - changing it for the better, not just for the UK but for all member states... there are several areas where the EU needs to raise its game. Businesses want to see more trade deals, completion of the single market and less red tape."  The Institute of Directors urged businesses not to "bury their heads in the sand" over the EU referendum and had "a duty to their shareholders, employees and customers to be discussing the implications of the vote at the most senior levels".

It found 20 large drones had been destroyed or had sustained at least $2m in damage due to accidents last year.  The military's most advanced drone, the Reaper - used, including by the RAF, in the US-led military intervention against so-called Islamic State - was one of the worst affected.  Experts warned the impact of drone crashes was likely to get worse.  The Washington Post obtained accident investigation documents through a Freedom of Information request.  It revealed investigators had traced the problems experienced by the Reaper to a faulty starter generator.  Deputy chief of staff Lt Gen Robert P Otto told the newspaper the USAF was "looking closely to determine what is the core issue there".  Drone Wars UK, which records the crashes of large military drones, says most military drone crashes since 2007 have been in Afghanistan, with the second highest number in the US - where military drones are tested.  Iraq has the third highest number of crashes.  And since 2011, crashes have been reported in or off the coast of seven African countries as well as Libya, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen.  According to Chris Cole, of Drone Wars UK, said: "Large military drones crash so often that we can track the spreading use of these systems simply through looking at crash data.  "In 2007, only three countries saw crashes of these large military drones - Afghanistan, Iraq and the US.  "But by the end of 2014, this had risen to 23 countries, indicating an almost eightfold increase in their use in just a few years.  "Remotely controlled drones are inherently less safe than aircraft with a pilot on-board, and that is why we see so many crashes.  "While the military drone crashes that have happened so far tend to be in remote locations, if regulators give in to the increasing pressure to open up British and European airspace to these large drones, the impact is likely to be far greater."	tech

The initiative is part of an industry-wide push to encourage people to learn coding, amid concerns of a skills shortage.  It comes as Apple faces strong competition from rival app platform Google Play.  Apple hopes to expand its training programme to countries worldwide.  Chief executive Tim Cook said: "Europe is home to some of the most creative developers in the world, and we're thrilled to be helping the next generation of entrepreneurs in Italy get the skills they need for success."  Apple says its app store has created more than 1.4 million jobs in Europe.  The UK leads the way with 242,000 jobs in iOS development, followed by Germany with 209,000, France with 163,000, and Italy with 75,000.  But Google Play had twice the number of downloads in 2015, according to app analytics company App Annie.  Although, Apple makes more revenue from apps - partly because Google's popularity is mainly in the developing world, where users spend less money on downloads.  App Annie's European director Jaede Tan said: "Apple opening such a centre can only be a positive for the European app economy.  "Forty-thousand apps are downloaded each month, and there are an increasing number of people getting involved in development."  The European Commission predicts the lack of coding skills in Europe could lead to a shortage of up to 900,000 ICT professionals by 2020.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35350417	Is 'King Jeremy the Accidental' on the up?	There is an old blues standard with the lyric "I've been down so very damn long, this looks like up to me". By that measure, things are looking up for the Labour leader.  To the fury and frustration of many of his parliamentary colleagues, and the slack-jawed amazement of some lobby journalists, Jeremy Corbyn is still in the job after failing every test they have set him.  Perhaps, it says as much about them as about him.  Now the smoke has cleared away from the reshuffle, he has regained control over a key policy - Trident.  He was given a kind of standing ovation for a speech to a Fabian conference, which some described as his best yet.  And he survived a big interview with Andrew Marr, with only one headline mocking his naivety.  Perhaps most importantly, Len McCluskey the leader of the UK's biggest union, Unite, told me, on BBC Radio 4's World This Weekend programme, that to regard the May elections as a referendum on Mr Corbyn was ridiculous - he would be "allowed"' two or three years to prove himself.  These are all a very low bars.  Mr Cameron and Mr Osborne are not quaking in their boots.  But they leave the Labour right with a huge conundrum - one insightful commentator has been musing recently on whether it should even want to do well in the coming elections.  Fanciful ideas circulate about MPs saying they have a mandate, because millions of people have voted for them, whereas Mr Corbyn and Labour members do not.  But basing a strategy around losing elections and formalising a split are more of a yardstick of desperation than practical politics.  Journalists and politicians based at Westminster see the world in a certain way, through a fairly narrow lens, and measure daily success and failure through a set of unwritten rules reached by instinct rather than reflection.  The soap opera of the Westminster village matters to those who adore the storyline.  It is often about a tug of war between positive and negative headlines, trials of strength over internal and external opponents, with all the fragility of narrative within a bubble.  One of the reason's Mr Corbyn attracts so much opprobrium from those whose orbit circles planet Westminster is he will not accept their measure of his worth.  He seems more concerned with remaking the Labour Party in his own image than winning applause from hostile crowds.  The climax of one of my favourite science-fiction novels by the late, great Iain M Banks, The Player of Games has the representative of a pan-species libertarian communist idyll of which Mr Corbyn might approve taking on a brutal, fascistic, authoritarian and warlike regime at a sort of violent hi-tech version of multi-dimensional chess.  He, unwittingly, plays their destructive game of conquest and revenge in a way that turns it into an artistic performance, a harmonious, complex ballet.  His opponents react with vast, speechless fury because he has done something much worse than beat them.  He has undermined their rules and their values.  The Jeremy Corbyn Story: Profile of Labour's new leader  Jeremy Corbyn: Who is Labour's new leader?  This is not to say Mr Corbyn is about to do the same.  But Westminster's rules are not the only measure.  There is a similar level of mutual incomprehension.  And the Labour leader, with an equal lack of guile, is subverting the game itself.  It is not that Mr Corbyn does not play by the rules, so much as he simply distains them, a debutant who turns up at the ball in torn jeans and slouches against the wall, sullenly refusing to join the dance.  New Labour's architects understood something obvious but rarely exploited until then - politicians are known to the great mass of voters only through the media.  A central part of their strategy was to seize control of the way their image and actions would be reported.  The techniques varied from wooing to bullying, circumventing the hard questions to tackling them head on.  The message merged with the medium.  Mr Corbyn appears to be the very mirror image of this.  His speeches do not contain an obvious attention-grabbing new policy, briefed in advance.  Prime Minister's Questions is not a mano-a-mano trial of strength, envisaged through the lens of the next hour's headline.  Inside the serious personnel management of a reshuffle, there is no central message.  But in this he is, possibly unwittingly, following a central insight of Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair about media management - most people do not follow the details of politics, it is the broad image, a flavour, that comes across.  It could just work.  Mr Corbyn's dogged pursuit of policy and principle without fancy frills and theatrical lunges at the enemy does portray a certain earnest sincerity that clearly appeals to many potential supporters of the Labour Party.  My unscientific analysis would suggest many Corbyn enthusiasts are not the Trotskyists of MPs' imagination but people disillusioned by Mr Blair and Gordon Brown, impelled by youthful enthusiasm or nostalgic remembrance for something with less "yah" and "boo" and more principle.  For often less than good or sensible reasons, "politician" has long been an insult - people who elevate tactics and electoral victory over higher purpose.  Not being like them, may not be seen as such a bad thing.  But the problem for the Labour Party is this may be enough to keep Mr Corbyn from being seriously challenged but not enough to win any new voters.  As Margaret Beckett's report makes clear, having an electable leader and a winning economic policy are central but not the only challenges.  The loss of Scotland, the collapse of working-class loyalty, English identity, an ageing population, the ideological challenges for the centre left are, on their own, big roadblocks on the path to power.  Piled up together, it is hard to envisage the sort of bulldozer that could shift them.  Mr Corbyn may not be the man for the job - but he is the man with the job, behind the wheel.  I have always found when kings and queens forged history fascinating.  They were often very ordinary people, without formal training, thrust into exceptional roles.  How they fared says much about human nature and politics.  But this is not true of modern democracies.  Indeed, it is not true of most modern dictatorships.  Whether Stalin or Churchill, or indeed Neil Kinnock or Iain Duncan Smith, leaders have paid their dues, gained a patina of experience, during their far from inexorable and inevitable rise.  They have learnt the tricks of the trade the hard way, hard knocks filing off rough edges.  But this is not true of Mr Corbyn, who never planned to be leader, never thought he would be, and has not jostled colleagues for power and position.  The fervent republican King Jeremy the Accidental has little past history of cunning or compromise, just the guiding principle of a passionately held set of ideas.  We may need a different ruler to measure his rule - both its length and purpose.	politics

"Yeehaw!" cries the rocket-engineer as he drives the all-terrain buggy hard over the rocks and scrub of the Nevada Desert.  With his big hat and moustache, he looks like a cowboy riding out over his territory.  The chap in the borrowed bright-orange quilted jacket, hanging on for dear life in the back, looks less at home. That's me.  I had expected cold weather, but not the chill of hurtling through desert air at 6C in fog and rain.  The excitingly named Brogan BamBrogan - yes, he changed it; no, I didn't ask why - is taking me on the very first tour of 50 acres (0.2 sq km) of desert that will, in the next year, become a test track for the Hyperloop.  Originally conceived by Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk, Hyperloop is an idea of colossal ambition and science-fiction proportions.  Passengers and freight will sit in pods propelled at high speed from city to city, inside low-pressure tubes on stilts above the landscape.  "It will have a top speed of over 1,000km/h [620mph]," Mr BamBrogan shouts over the engine.  "We will use the pillars to even out the bumps in the terrain so people don't feel weird."  The buggy bounces over a rock and whisks past the 20 massive tubes already on site, and I find what concerns me is not the technical challenge.  I can absolutely believe the skills Hyperloop Technologies has brought in from the likes of SpaceX could crack the science, overcome the air resistance, and withstand the acceleration - it will be gentle.  What my mind, lacking as it does the ambition, faith and blue-sky thinking of some of Hyperloop's backers and directors, cannot envision, is that within the next decade or so we could see the beginnings of something so radical that it would transform the landscape.  "This is a big deal," I call back, "an entirely new form of transport. Do you think it will ever come off?"  Mr BamBrogan replies: "It will absolutely come off.  "This is the first generation that has not seen a new form of transport.  "People over the years have seen advancements, and it has changed their lives."  There are big barriers to doing this - would people really want to get inside a vacuum tube and be propelled at up to 700mph?  Given the time you would need to accelerate to 700mph and back to stationary, you would have to have quite a gap in-between the pods to make it safe.  I would question whether you could get the throughput of people Hyperoloop suggests.  But mostly I think my concern is over the cost of it.  The cost of putting anything on pylons or stilts is expensive.  And the thought of building that across California sounds very expensive indeed to me.  Of course, I would love to see it happen and be proved wrong.  Yes, but each leap forward in transportation has cost.  But the initial proposed track from Los Angeles to San Francisco has been estimated at costing $8bn (£5.6bn).  And it will need a lot of buy-in from any government that fancies a Hyperloop in its country.  "The regulatory side is a key part," one of the cofounders tells me later.  Shervin Pishevar is no stranger to ripping up the transport rulebook.  He was one of Uber's first backers and says even though the regulators tried to shut Uber down, "people basically forced it open again, because they wanted these types of solutions".  Of course apping-up taxis on existing infrastructure has immediate public appeal.  Tubing-up thousands of miles of land at massive cost might not invoke so much people power.  Still, $37m buys you a lot of pipe.  And the one I am now standing inside will be connected to 199 others by the end of this year to form the 3km (1.9 mile) Nevada test track.  "Welcome to the Hyperloop!" I shout for the camera.  And the acoustics cause my voice to reverberate along the tube.  It sounds futuristic, and, therefore, makes great TV.  Let's just hope Hyperloop can be more than just a pipedream.	tech

The UK's Advertising Standards Authority said it was considering the step to ensure people "aren't misled by pricing claims".  It follows a study that indicated most users could not correctly calculate bills based on the information given in a selection of broadband ads.  The ASA said it would make a final decision before June.  A lobby group representing the broadband industry has suggested more research is needed before any changes are imposed.  But one of the internet service providers has already said it supports reform.  "It's obvious that a single headline price is much clearer and better for customers, and we're actually already doing it on a pilot project up in York," said a spokesman for TalkTalk.  "But until the whole market moves to single prices, any company that advertises its products like this will struggle to compete with what look like better deals from other providers."  The announcement comes a month after the charity Citizens Advice called on the ASA to review its code of practice because it said consumers were being misled by attractive-sounding broadband offers.  The ASA has suggested it will call on ISPs to follow three new guidelines:  "Advertising works better when it's trusted," said the ASA's chief executive Guy Parker.  "We'll now be moving quickly, working alongside broadband providers, to clarify the presentation of price information."  The move follows a study carried out on behalf of both the ASA and the communications regulator Ofcom in June.  It involved 300 home broadband "decision makers" being shown adverts that had been made for TV, newspapers, websites and outside billboards.  The research firm Futuresight then quizzed them about their recall of the details.  "Many people are confused by complicated adverts and offers, so we welcome the ASA's plans to simplify broadband advertising," said Ofcom's chief executive Sharon White.  However, the Internet Services Providers' Association has raised concerns.  "[We] believe that more detailed research is needed to corroborate the survey findings," said Nicholas Lansman, the industry group's secretary general.  "Beyond adverts, ISPs provide clear information if consumers engage more closely with them, for example by going to their website, visiting a shop, working with comparison and consumer websites or by calling the providers.  "This has not been reflected in the survey, which is based on a small sample size with some of the reviewed adverts only being shown to eight participants."	tech

The US bank is said to have backed Britain Stronger In Europe, a cross-party group leading the In campaign.  Britain Stronger In Europe said it would not confirm the donation which Sky News said was a "substantial" sum.  It comes as David Cameron prepares to tell business to "make the case" for the staying in a "reformed EU".  In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday, Mr Cameron will say the "voice of business" must be heard in the run-up to the referendum on the UK's membership of EU - which will take place before the end of 2017.  "If you agree with me about the changes I am arguing for in Europe… if you want a more competitive Europe, where the single market is completed, where there are more trade deals and fewer regulations… join me in making that case," he will say.  The exact timing of the referendum will hinge on the outcome of Mr Cameron's current renegotiation talks, due to come to a head at a summit of European leaders next month.  Goldman Sachs, which employs 6,000 people in the UK, has not commented on the donation. Although the sum being mooted is relatively small, the move would be symbolic and illustrative of the City's concerns about the implications of the UK leaving the EU.  A spokesman for Britain Stronger In Europe, which is chaired by ex-Marks & Spencer boss Lord Rose, told the BBC: "We are not going to comment on individual donations to the campaign at this stage.  "We will in time declare all our donations in line with standard electoral commission rules once we are the designated campaign. We are raising money from individuals and businesses in the UK from all walks of life. We believe that Britain is Stronger, safer and better off in Europe."  Leave.eu, one of the groups campaign for EU exit, dismissed Goldman Sachs' involvement.  Its founder, UKIP donor Arron Banks, tweeted: "No surprise to those of us who have said all along EU referendum will be a campaign of British people against the establishment of international bankers, multinational corporate tax dodgers and out-of-touch politicians."  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said the referendum date would only be decided once the UK has a deal on a renegotiated membership, amid speculation that an agreement next month would open the door for a vote in June.  Speaking in Edinburgh on Wednesday, he said: "If we get a deal, a June vote would be a possibility in terms of the timescales of the Referendum Act but that will only be decided once we've got a deal."  Meanwhile, Eurosceptic Labour MPs launched their own campaign to leave the EU, called Labour Leave, backed by the businessman John Mills.	politics

The EU wants to scrap the rule that means refugees must claim asylum in the first country they arrive in, and introduce a new dispersal scheme.  European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker says he wants a deal on refugees around the same time as one on David Cameron's renegotiation demands.  Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said he was "very concerned" by the idea.  Mr Juncker said he was "convinced the EU Council in February will reach a fair deal for Britain", which Mr Cameron has said will pave the way for an in/out referendum later this year.  But Mr Juncker added: "I am worried we won't have enough time to tackle there the refugee question in sufficient depth. I recommend to (European Council President) Donald Tusk that he holds a further summit.  "We can't have a success on the UK and not address the refugee quotas, that would be a mistake."  The European Commission wants to scrap what is known as the Dublin agreement, which dictates refugees must claim asylum in the "first country of entry".  Mr Juncker says he wants a "fairer" system that does not place the burden on "three or four countries" that "are dealing with the situation on their own," while "some countries aren't complying with their responsibilities".  "A very large number of refugees are targeting specific countries, refugees want to decide where they want to go, and that is simply unacceptable," he added.  Some EU states have brought in temporary border controls as migrants travelled north from Italy and Greece - and Brussels fears the passport-free Schengen area, which includes every EU nation except Britain and Ireland, could collapse if a solution is not worked out soon.  The UK could opt out of any new EU scheme to deal with refugees. So why does this matter in Westminster?  First, because if the Dublin agreement is scrapped Britain may not be able to return refugees to other EU nations.  That could mean more people settling in this country, although the numbers may be modest compared to overall migration.  Second, because the timing could be very awkward.  Imagine this: February, and David Cameron seals an EU deal which he says resets Britain's relationship, tipping control away from Europe.  March: the European Commission unveils a new plan to disperse refugees across the continent and asks the UK to take part.  However much some campaigners might try to talk about other issues, that could rapidly centre the referendum fight on the fate of refugees and levels of immigration.  Britain has been under pressure to take in more people as Europe struggles to deal with a huge influx of refugees. It has opted out of an EU quota system but pledged to resettle 20,000 Syrian refugees over the next five years.  The UK could opt out of any new migration quotas agreed by other EU nations - but potentially at the expense of losing the right to return refugees to other EU nations.  International Development Secretary Justine Greening said the UK would be "strongly against" any attempt to scrap the "first country of entry" rule and Britain would retain its opt-out on whatever was decided.  And Mr Hammond said the "noises" coming out of Brussels were worrying.  "We regard the Dublin Agreement as an important part of the architecture within the EU.  "And if it's going to be changed, it will need to be changed in a way that makes sense and that protects our interests."  Alanna Thomas, senior researcher at Migration Watch UK, said: "The Dublin regulation was undermined this summer when Angela Merkel committed to processing all asylum applications from Syrian nationals who entered Germany."  But the Refugee Council said the Dublin system "has never been fit for purpose and is inherently unfair on Europe's border nations".  Refugee Council policy manager Judith Dennis said: "At the moment, under the Dublin regulation, asylum seekers are shuttled around the continent like unwanted luggage, and at great expense, as states in northern Europe try to shirk their responsibility towards protecting refugees.  "It's absolutely clear that we need to see a more equitable system for sharing responsibility across Europe for protecting refugees and enabling them to reunite with their family members here.  "Protecting refugees isn't just a job for the Greeks and the Italians; they simply don't have the ability to deliver a continent's worth of compassion alone. It's vital that all countries across Europe, including Britain, step forward and offer to help the desperate refugees arriving in Europe find safety."	politics

But many of the 12,000 backers - who had put in £2.3m and ended up with nothing - had angry words for the crowdfunding platform.  Kickstarter responded in a creative way - by commissioning an investigative journalist to find out what went wrong. Now his report has been published.  Mark Harris, a technology writer based in Seattle, travelled to South Wales, spent six weeks speaking to as many people as he could reach and produced an epic account of the history of the Zano.  In more than 13,000 words he describes the origins of the Torquing Group, a business that was essentially the personal mission of self-taught engineer Ivan Reedman to build a marketable drone; how clever - though misleading - marketing turned the Zano into a Kickstarter sensation, galloping past its original funding target; and then the disaster which unfolded as Reedman and his colleagues discovered they just did not have the skills or the experience to mass produce the mini-drone.  It is the backers for whom this work was designed and many of them will be hoping for a smoking gun to reinforce their belief that the whole project was just a scam to get them to part with their money. They will be disappointed. Mr Harris concludes that this was case of foul-up, not foul play.  "Torquing's directors managed their business poorly and spent the Kickstarter money too freely, but I've found no evidence that any of them ended up rich on the backs of the crowd," concluded Harris.  He does raise serious questions about the video which excited so much interest in the project. Reedman denies that CGI, other drones or even selfie sticks were used to create a misleading picture of what the Zano could do but admits that the video shows features that were not operational at the time it was shot.  In fact, as I found when I came to shoot a demo of the project last August, the Zano never delivered what was promised in the video.  But it was not only potential backers who swallowed exaggerations in the marketing campaign. Kickstarter chose Zano as a "staff pick" and the tech news site Engadget shortlisted it for its best of CES 2015 award, even though the Torquing team could not demonstrate the drone flying at the show. As late as October, Popular Science chose it as one of its 100 most amazing innovations of 2015.  The writer does not accuse the Torquing team of dishonesty but says that as production problems mounted and the money began to run out they showed "a dangerous lack of self-awareness of the problems the company was making for itself".  Harris has only managed to speak on the record to Reedman, but he concludes that neither he or the other members of the team "possessed the technical or commercial competencies necessary to deliver the Zano as specified in the original campaign".  But the most significant lessons to be drawn from his account are for Kickstarter. The crowdfunding platform, which paid for his work, was allowed to look at the finished article before publication but not to change anything. He says all crowdfunding platforms need to reconsider the way they deal with projects involving complex hardware, massive overfunding, or large sums of money.  He wants them to look at bringing in mentors to advise projects like Zano which suddenly find themselves taking on far more than they had planned. He also wants Kickstarter to be far more explicit about the nature of the risk backers are taking - and more active in weeding out weak projects before they are funded.  Harris interviewed Kickstarter's co-founder Yancey Strickler and though he appears to find a few of the suggestions helpful, he is robust in rejecting most of the criticisms. He says that while the platform does have rules about realistic videos showing a genuine prototype, they are hard to enforce.  Tightening up the rules can only go so far, he argues, and it is essential for backers to understand that it is up to them to evaluate a project. "If you want 100% success with hardware and new products, I think the only solution is that you just shop on Amazon," he adds.  And in the end, Harris seems to agree. If we want an alternative to banks and venture capital as a funding source for high-risk tech start-ups, he says, we may have to accept the occasional Zano alongside the Pebbles and Oculus Rifts.  Now, some of the thousands of people who lost money backing this doomed project will look cynically at a piece of journalism funded by the very organisation they see as partly responsible for their losses.  But what Harris - and Kickstarter - have produced is a valuable contribution to our understanding of the risky nature of any technology hardware start-up.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35363865	Tory MP Crispin Blunt 'outs himself' as popper user	A Conservative MP has told the House of Commons he is a user of the popper recreational drug and a ban on its supply would be "fantastically stupid".  Ex-minister Crispin Blunt said users of the drug were "astonished" by talk of a ban and respect for the law "would fly out of the window" if it happened.  Supplying the drug, which is popular with gay men, could be outlawed under the Psychoactive Substances Bill.  MPs have rejected calls to exempt poppers from the legislation.  Following a debate in the Commons, they voted by 309 to 228 against the move.  The government wants to crack down on the sale and use of so-called legal highs, psychoactive substances chemically designed to mimic drugs that are already banned. Some 18 deaths in England and Wales in 2014 were linked to so-called legal highs.  But plans to ban the supply of poppers as part of the legislation have caused controversy.  Poppers, the name given to a group of chemicals called alkyl nitrites, are normally sniffed from a bottle producing a short head-rush. They are used recreationally and are often referred to as a "party drug".  During a debate on the bill in the Commons, Mr Blunt - who is the uncle of actress Emily Blunt and is a former prisons minister - said he would be "directly affected" by the ban.  "There are sometimes that something is proposed which becomes personal to you and you realise the government is about to do something fantastically stupid and in those circumstances one has a duty to speak up," he said.  "I use poppers. I out myself as a user of poppers. I am astonished to find it (the government) is proposing it to be banned and frankly so would many other gay men."  Mr Blunt, who came out as gay in 2010, said the drug had been used for decades and a ban would "simply serve to bring the whole law into disrepute". He warned that banning it would "drive supply underground into the hands of criminals" and increase the use of Class A and Class B drugs.  He later told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that he had not suffered any adverse affects from using the drug and there was no "serious evidence" that it posed such a risk. "I think it was the most powerful argument to make and I didn't want to be a hypocrite," he said of his Commons statement.  Personal possession of poppers will not be criminalised as a result of the proposed legislation but there would be a blanket ban on their production, supply and importation, and the police would be authorised to shut down websites selling them.  Critics say this has not been thought through, pointing to a report by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs which concluded that their misuse is "not seen to be capable of having harmful effects sufficient to constitute a societal problem".  Labour spokeswoman Lyn Brown told the Commons that she had heard that use of the drug "enhances sexual experience".  The shadow Home Office minister said her party supported the government in tackling "the scourge of these dangerous substances" but opposed a specific ban on poppers, saying they had been in use for 30 years and no government had sought to ban them.  "I am greatly disappointed the government has chosen not to place poppers on the exemptions list," she said. "I do believe this will undermine the bill and place popper users, particularly men who have sex with men, at greater use of harm."  Home Office minister Mike Penning assured MPs that a ban on poppers would not permanently take affect without a further review of the evidence, initially by the Medicine and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority and then by an independent expert.  The review would report by the summer, with a decision to be taken jointly by the Home Office and Department of Health, he told MPs.  "I think that is a compromise," he said. "I think I have listened extensively. I know this is going to be difficult for individuals. I fully respect individuals' views bit I hope everyone in the house respects that I am trying to do the right thing to protect people."  But Mr Blunt, who survived attempts to deselect him in 2013 by members of the Conservative association in his Reigate constituency, said the government could find itself in the strange position of banning the supply of poppers in April and then "unbanning" them later this year.  The likely effect of this, he added, was that users of poppers would end up "stocking up".  David Raynes, from the National Drug Prevention Alliance, said he was surprised by Mr Blunt's intervention.  "Poppers are not an innocuous substance," he told PM.  "The government's own website talks about deaths.  "It talks about heart problems and talks about eyesight problems.  "If people in important positions in public life speak about these things, they are bound to affect the culture and indeed may encourage young people to use them.  "He has had months to make his representations.  "And I deplore the fact it has been done so late in the day and so noisily."	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35360895	David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn clash over nurse and student grants	David Cameron and Jeremy Corbyn have clashed at Prime Minister's Questions over the axing of student grants and bursaries for nurses in England.  Mr Cameron said replacing bursaries with loans would mean more nurses would be trained - and scrapping student grants would let more go to university.  He accused Mr Corbyn of wanting to "cap aspiration".  But the Labour leader said the PM was saddling students with debt and robbing the NHS of talented would-be nurses.  The Labour leader attempted to strike a headmasterly tone, peering over his glasses with disapproval at a Tory heckler and asking "are you done?"  He stuck to the same broad theme for his six questions and used two crowd-sourced questions, from student Liam and aspiring nurse Vicky.  There were nods of approval from deputy Tom Watson as Mr Corbyn tried to throw Mr Cameron's jibes about being against aspiration back at him.  Aspiration was Mr Cameron's word of the day, as he repeatedly accused the Labour leader of trying to "cap" it.  He ended with the now traditional jibe that he is a threat to national security, broadening it out to cover the entire Labour Party - as well as saying they were retreating into the past.  "We've seen it with wanting to bring back secondary picketing, they want to bring back flying pickets, we've seen it with the idea of stopping businesses paying dividends, and with the absurd idea that nuclear submarines should go to sea without their missiles.  "Anyone watching this Labour Party - and it's not now just the leader, it's the whole Labour Party - they are a risk to our national security, a risk to our economic security, a risk to our health service, and to the security of every family in our country."  Mr Corbyn asked why a student called Liam, who is training to be a maths teacher, would finish his course with debts of more than £50,000, roughly twice his annual income.  Mr Cameron replied: "What I would say to Liam is he is now in a country with a university system with more people going to university than ever before and more people from low-income backgrounds going to university than ever before.  "In addition, what I would say to Liam, and I wish him well, is that he will not pay back a penny of his loan until he's earning £21,000, he will not start paying back in full until he's earning £35,000.  "Our policy is actually going to put more money in the hands of students like Liam, which is why we're doing it."  He claimed Labour plans to scrap loans and fees would cost £10bn, meaning the country would go back to "a situation where people went out, worked hard, pay their taxes for an elite to go to university".  On Tuesday, Labour failed in a last-ditch bid to block the replacement of student maintenance grants in England, which are worth up to £3,500 for university students from poorer families, with loans.  Mr Corbyn asked why student nurses in England were being hit with an effective pay cut of £900 through the scrapping of bursaries, quoting the example of "Vicky", a single mother from York, who said she could not afford to train as a mental health nurse.  Mr Cameron claimed "two out of three Vickys.. who want to be nurses" are rejected under the current system and nurses have to be brought in from "Bulgaria and Romania" to do jobs that home-grown nurses should be doing.  Mr Corbyn claimed "nine out of 10 hospitals currently have a nurse shortage" and the government's plans would make this worse.  The Labour leader then highlighted comments from Tory MP and former nurse Maria Caulfield who said she would have struggled to train without a bursary.  Mr Cameron denied this, claiming the proposals would actually "uncap" the numbers that go into nursing and create 10,000 extra nurse degree places.  Jeremy Corbyn was barracked by Conservative MPs after David Cameron reaffirmed the government's support for Falkland islanders' right to self-determination and rejection of Argentina's claim to the Falklands, which Buenos Aires has maintained since the 1982 war.  Speaking after the Commons clash, a senior Labour source said the party supported "self-determination" for the Falkland Islanders but there was a need for a fresh dialogue with Argentina "to seek a long-term solution to the conflict".  Mr Corbyn sparked controversy in a weekend TV interview by saying he wanted discussions on "some reasonable accommodation" with Argentina, adding that the islanders should have an "enormous say" in any discussions on their future,  The Conservatives had some Beatles-related fun with Jeremy Corbyn's suggestion, in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, that the UK could retain its nuclear missile submarines but send them to sea without their warheads.  Lincoln MP Karl McCartney set the prime minister up, claiming that Labour's defence policy was "inspired by The Beatles' Yellow Submarine and shows that while the members opposite may Twist And Shout, their current leader certainly needs Help".  Mr Cameron hailed his "ingenious" question before providing the punchline: "All I can say when it comes to Beatles songs, I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition prefers Back In The USSR."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35364066	BBC Micro Bit mini-computer faces further delay	The BBC has again delayed its release plan for the Micro Bit.  The tiny computer was originally supposed to have been given to one million schoolchildren last October.  The corporation said it now planned to start giving teachers their own units just after the half-term holidays, to help them plan classes.  It added it was "pushing to deliver as many as possible" to pupils before the term's end but could not be more specific about how many or when.  The idea behind the project has been widely praised, but some teachers are concerned they will no longer have enough time to do it justice this school year.  The Micro Bit is designed to run code written by children that will let them display text and patterns on its 25 LEDs and make use of its built-in sensors.  The idea is that they will be able to create simple games they can play on the device.  In addition, they can physically connect it to other hardware or link it up to a smartphone via Bluetooth to carry out more complex functions.  The BBC has promised to give one to every child in Year 7 or equivalent.  Last September, it revealed a problem with the power supply had caused a delay, adding teachers would receive the device before the end of 2015 and children "early in the new year".  But on Wednesday, at the Bett education trade show in London, the BBC said its timetable had slipped again.  "The main issue has been some fine-tuning," BBC Learning executive Cerys Griffiths said.  "We have created hardware, it's very complex, it's very sophisticated, it's very new.  "What we were really hoping for was that the teachers would get their devices before Christmas.  "But our commitment to teachers has always been that we would get them the devices first to give them time to play and get familiar with them."  Some schools have been given prototype Micro Bits.  Emily Rowland, a teacher at Manchester's Fairfield High School for Girls, said even the least able of her pupils had been able to use them to show smiley-face graphics.  But she added the delay to the proper rollout was causing concern.  "Some teachers get panicked by the idea that they can only use them for six weeks of the summer term and haven't even seen one yet," she said.  "Quite a lot of schools will struggle to put them in place this summer, and some will have to put it off until the next school year, and then the issue is who do you give the freebies to?"  Another computing teacher, Steve Richards, from Eastlea Community School, in London, had a more positive view of events.  "I understand the frustration of other teachers, because it is this wonderful thing that is slightly out of reach," he said.  "But judging by the kind of things we have been able to do with [the prototypes], it will be worth the wait."  Although the hardware may be delayed, there is already software available to give children a chance to start coding in advance of receiving their micro-computers:  To help offset any disappointment, the BBC has also promised to release more copies of the device than it had originally planned, meaning some children in other school years should also receive one.  Ms Griffiths also stressed that just because the Year 7 pupils would receive the Micro Bits later than had originally been hoped, that would not mean their time with the devices needed to be more limited.  "This device was never intended for just for one year," she said.  "Each child will own their own device, so we are hoping they will use them during the summer holidays.  "And we will have loads of activities and stimulus for them to use into Year 8, so it won't be just for one term."	tech

Labour has revealed that it failed to include invoices for the plinth to the Electoral Commission as part of its total general election spending.  It blamed the omission on an "administrative error".  Labour spent £12m on the campaign, the watchdog's figures show, compared with £15.5m spent by the Conservatives.  In total, £39m was spent by the UK's six largest parties on the campaign, an increase on the £34.4m spent in 2010 but lower than the record £42m spent in 2005.  Although comfortably outspending Labour over the regulated period - between 23 May 2014 and 7 May 2015 - the Conservatives spent less than in 2010, when their budget was £16.6m. In contrast, Labour spent more than in 2010, when their total outlay was £8m.  A breakdown of the figures show the Conservatives spent 27.7% of their budget on "unsolicited material", such as flyers, and 23.2% on advertising while Labour spent 61% of their budget on "unsolicited material" and 7.6% on advertising.  Spending on rallies accounted for 13% of Labour's total expenditure compared with the Conservatives' 5% while the Conservatives spent 30.1% of their budget on market research and canvassing against Labour's 7.7% outlay.  The Conservatives spent £1.2m on advertising on Facebook in the year before the poll while Labour spent just over £16,000.  Ed Miliband unveiled the eight foot stone carving on the final weekend of the campaign, saying that it would be installed in the garden of Downing Street to remind the party of its duty to honour its six main election promises.  The move was met with near universal derision by the media and the subsequent fate of what became known as the "Ed Stone" has been unclear. Various unconfirmed reports have suggested it resides in a warehouse in London or has been destroyed.  Spending on the stone is not included in the Electoral Commission data released on Wednesday.  Labour said: "Due to an administrative error these invoices were not included with other items of campaign spend. We have informed the Electoral Commission and will seek to rectify this error as soon as possible."  The figures do not cover some administrative spending, for instance on staff, while spending by individual candidates is reported separately.  The SNP reported the biggest rise in spending compared with 2010, when their expenditure totalled £316,000. In contrast, the Lib Dems' spending fell from £4.7m in 2010 to £3.5m last year.  The UK Independence Party spent £2.8m while the Greens spent £1.1m. UKIP spent the least per vote gained while the SNP spent least per MP won.  In the 2015 general election the Conservatives had 331 MPs elected, Labour 232, the SNP 56, and the Lib Dems 8.	politics

Until now, the social network had been defined by its 140-character limit.  But from 28 January, it will allow some users to write longer messages, although not all of the text will immediately appear in followers' feeds.  The move could increase pressure on Twitter to do likewise.  China's official news agency, Xinhua, reported Weibo's chief executive Wang Gaofei had confirmed the move.  It said that during a pilot phase, only the first 140 characters would be shown to readers up front and they would have to click on a link to see the contents of longer messages.  It added that only "senior users" would be able to use the extended facility from the start but it would be open to other members before the end of February.  In its last financial report, Sina Corp said its Weibo service had more than 200 million users.  That is about 100 million fewer than Twitter, which recently indicated it was reconsidering its own character limit.  "We didn't start Twitter with a 140-character restriction," chief executive Jack Dorsey wrote earlier this month.  "We added that early on to fit into a single SMS message.  "It's become a beautiful constraint... [but] we've spent a lot of time observing what people are doing on Twitter, and we see them taking screenshots of text and tweeting it.  "What if that... was actually text? Text that could be searched, text that could be highlighted - that's more utility and power."  One company watcher said Twitter risked damaging its appeal by ditching one of the features that made it stand out against Facebook, but added it might have little choice.  "They have to do something, as they are clearly losing the social-media game right now," said Dr Bernie Hogan, from the Oxford Internet Institute.  "It's still keenly used by some people, including journalists and academics, but it is not showing a lot of growth or profit.  "And Dorsey's moves at the company so far have not inspired a lot of people to use it in the way that they were hoping."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35361090	Largest known prime number discovered in Missouri	The largest known prime number has been discovered by a computer at a university in Missouri in the US.  Prime numbers - such as two, three, five and seven - are divisible only by themselves and one, and play an important role in computer encryption.  The new prime is more than 22 million digits long, five million longer than the previous largest prime.  Primes this large could prove useful to computing in the future.  The new prime number was found as part of the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (Gimps), a global quest to find a particular type of large prime numbers.  Mersenne primes are named after a French monk who studied them in the 17th Century.  They are hunted by factoring two by a large number and taking away one, a relatively manageable calculation for today's computers, but not every result is a prime.  The discovered prime is written as 2^74,207,281-1, which denotes two, multiplied by itself 74,207,281 times, then take away one.  The Gimps project has discovered the 15 largest Mersenne primes in the 20 years it has been running and it is possible that there could be an infinite number of them to discover.  Large prime numbers are important in computer encryption and help make sure that online banking, shopping and private messaging are secure, but current encryption typically uses prime numbers that are hundreds of digits long, not millions.  "This prime is too large to currently be of practical value," the Gimps project admitted in a statement.  However, searching for large primes is intensive work for computer processors and can have unexpected benefits.  "One prime project discovered that there was a problem in some computer processors that only showed up in certain circumstances," said Dr Steven Murdoch, cybersecurity expert at University College London.  The new large prime, the 49th known Mersenne prime, was discovered by Dr Curtis Cooper at the University of Central Missouri.  Although computers do most of the hard work, primes are said to be discovered when a human takes note of the result.	tech

The social network said an "internal code change" had led to the problem, which lasted six hours 10 minutes.  "We reverted the change, which fixed the issue," it added.  Many of Twitter's 300 million users were unable to log in, or if they could, were unable to make searches or post tweets during the affected period.  Twitter's shares fell by nearly 7% following the disruption.  The BBC was later contacted by a US-based group of hackers who attempted to claim responsibility.  A spokesman from Twitter said it had "no comment" about the claim.  However, the BBC understands the company's systems indicate there were no outside factors involved in the disruption.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35350419	Should polling be banned before an election?	The political implications of the polling errors at the 2015 general election were quite profound.  The six-week campaign was dominated by 92 voting intention polls, very few of which came anywhere near the actual outcome of a Conservative victory.  The fact that most polls suggested a hung parliament shaped the entire campaign.  Detailed interrogation of party policies took a back seat to endless discussion about who would go into coalition with whom.  And the final weeks before polling day were so dominated by talk about the SNP that one could have been forgiven for thinking it was a Holyrood election rather than one for Westminster.  Should we cut through all this and simply ban the publication of opinion polls during election campaigns?  Pollsters object that, in the event of a ban, privately commissioned polls would be commissioned and their findings published abroad and then reported in the UK media. It would be virtually impossible to suppress them in this age of the internet.  A reasonable point: but does it invalidate the argument that election polls should be banned?  A 2012 international study conducted by the University of Hong Kong received replies from 83 countries when asked whether they operated any blackout period for polls during election campaigns.  Of these, 38 countries reported bans on the publication of pre-election polls in one form or another.  The list included Bhutan, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Mexico, Norway, Poland and Venezuela. In France, election polls are banned on polling day and the day before.  It is difficult to characterise the list as comprising countries where democracy is fragile and where authoritarian regimes prevail.  So, many mature democracies find no problem with restricting pre-election polls.  Would our own politics be any the poorer if such a ban were introduced?  In the absence of obsessive interest in the party horse race, might we discuss important subjects such as what the next government proposes to do for five years: the state of the economy, housing, the environment, schools and universities and the National Health Service?  However, if we ban the polls we could also lose the information they provide that is over and beyond simple voting intention, not least the priorities expressed by potential voters.  Polls contain very rich data about voter attitudes that the media often does not report.  But that suggests the media should sort itself out rather than Parliament legislating to cut off the supply.  There is also the argument that polls, with all their shortcomings, are far better than the alternatives we would be left with in the event of their being banned.  Would our news-hungry media fill the gap with leaks of "private" polls commissioned by political parties, ostensibly for their own use?  Or worse still, would every election campaign be splattered with reports of "sensational" canvass returns released by parties showing that they were sweeping the country in this election?  Rumour and spin do not appear to be particularly attractive alternatives to opinion polls.  For my part, I am not persuaded that polls should be banned during election campaigns.  However, I think the pollsters are on a short leash: their dreadful performance in 2015 and the damaging role they played in misdirecting the entire six weeks of the campaign have shaken public confidence quite severely.  If they cannot restore that public confidence quickly they will find themselves bereft of friends and supporters should the appetite grow for curtailing their activities during crucial election campaigns.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35259124	Is it time to expect more than dance moves from robots?	I, like many other busy, working parents, secretly crave for someone to help out with the household chores - from persuading children to do their homework, constantly picking up an assortment of footwear from the floor, emptying the dishwasher....the list goes on.  So when, at the CES Technology show in Las Vegas earlier this month, I had a secret assignation in a hotel room with a robot dubbed as a family assistant, I was pretty excited.  I love a cute robot and Jibo, brainchild of MIT professor and social roboticist Cynthia Breazeal, has been beguiling investors and press alike since it was launched on crowd-funding platform Indiegogo last year.  It raised $3.7m (£2.57m) and has been described by one analyst as a "game changer" - the social robot with the biggest chances of success.  Quite a lot of hype for what is essentially a stylishly designed, moving tablet but I was prepared to be impressed.  My excitement was tempered when I arrived at the swanky Las Vegas hotel suite that Jibo had taken over for the afternoon.  The demo showed Jibo dancing, which it did with something of a swagger, but nothing more. The robot remained tethered to a laptop and its human coder at all times.  Obviously I wasn't expecting it to fulfil my rather wildly optimistic wishlist but dancing would definitely not be on the collection of skills I'd have for my family assistant.  Jibo would, insisted Ms Breazeal, do far more when it launched in June but that functionality was "not ready" to show.  Its main job will be to connect families - it will recognise faces, remind busy parents of their "to do" list, take photos at family parties, read stories to the children and offer video chat to connect with the grandparents.  I asked whether giving Jibo this level of functionality was proving harder than first envisaged but, if it was, Ms Breazeal was giving nothing away, insisting it was on track for its spring shipping date.  Making robots work is hard. I have lost count of the number of demonstrations I have been to where robots needed to be rebooted.  More often that not the demo, when it finally does work, is of - you've guessed it - a robot dancing.  To say I am over robots dancing would be an understatement - so pity the poor demonstrator at the CES booth for UBTech's Alpha 2, a human-like robot with moveable joints that can also be programmed to walk, talk and translate.  "Can I see it in action?" I asked. "Please tell me it isn't going to dance."  "Er..it can also do yoga?" came the reply.  It will be available from March and will cost $1,299 (£900).  If robots are going to make an impact in the home, they are going to need to do a bit more - and do it reliably.  Prof Noel Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield and co-director of the Foundation for Responsible Robotics, thinks that the functionality of robots such as Jibo will quickly evolve.  "It is starting out like Skype on steroids with face recognition and tracking and a visually expressive Siri. But this is just a foot in the door. With all of its connectivity it provides great opportunity to meet consumer demands for a multitude of new apps. And many companies could follow suit to create a rapidly expanding competitive marketplace," he told the BBC.  "Such devices could easily become the core of smart homes and controllers for the internet of things: everything from game-playing companion to security guard to fridge food monitor to watching over granny or even allowing 'home visits' from the doctor."  The cuteness factor should not be overlooked, thinks Tom Austin, an artificial intelligence expert at research firm Gartner.  "At first glance, it competes with, of all things, Amazon's Echo, which is also a multi-user device, but Jibo is trying to be far less sterile and more personable while being social too."  Echo, for those not familiar, is essentially a speaker which is linked up to a voice assistant, dubbed Alexa. Users can ask it questions, shop and - following a tie-up with carmaker Ford - even ask it to open the front door when they are nearly in the driveway.  And it has one thing in its favour - it cannot dance.  Blue Frog Robotics, the firm behind French home robot Buddy - which does dance - was recently interviewed by the BBC about why people would pay for a robot when much of the functionality could be performed via a tablet.  "People don't want to talk to a tablet, they want to talk to a character. It becomes another member of the family," explained chief executive Rodolphe Hasselvander.  Intel has recently teamed up with Segway and Chinese robotics firm Ninebot with a proof of concept personal assistant that can also double up as a transport system.  Essentially a tablet stuck on top of a Segway, the robot is equipped with Intel's RealSense chip which provide its eyes, allowing it to navigate around the home, avoiding collisions.  Interestingly it has been made open source, allowing developers to build a range of apps for it.  This seems to be the way that robot makers are going. Softbank, the firm behind Pepper, which sells out every time a new batch goes on sale in Japan, has also created an app ecosystem to improve its functionality over time.  Softbank recently revealed that its brainpower is due to get a serious boost when it is hooked up with IBM's cognitive computing platform Watson later this year.  IBM is keen to move Pepper out of the home and into other environments and over the last year it has been honing Watson's Japanese-speaking skills.  It hopes to see the robot used in shops as a personal shopper, in schools as a teaching assistant and as a nurse in hospitals.  Most agree that robotics, long dominated by industrial and logistics uses, is coming of age. A report from Business Insider predicts that there will be a $1.5bn (£1.04bn) market for consumer and business robots by 2019.  It was unclear how many of these would dance.  Ok, dancing robots aren't so bad. They may not get the chores done but they do make you smile. And I guess, at this embryonic stage of robotics, that is half the battle.  They beguile us with their cuteness and human-like qualities - perhaps to make up for the fact that they can't yet perform the functions we really crave from them.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35355390	Perceptions of Ed Miliband 'among reasons' for Labour loss	Ed Miliband was not judged to be as strong a leader as David Cameron, an internal Labour report into why the party lost the 2015 election has found.  The report, written by former Cabinet minister Dame Margaret Beckett, said the comparative standing of the two men was one of four reasons for the defeat.  Other factors identified were failures in economic and immigration policy and the fear of the SNP propping up Labour.  The report said Labour faced a "huge challenge" to win again in 2020.  The report concludes that the party needs a massive upswing in its fortunes in England and Scotland if it is to be returned to power in five years time.  It urges the party to do more to appeal to older voters and to construct a clear "policy narrative" that can be sold to the public.  The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the analysis made "sobering reading" for Labour, with weaknesses identified in key areas.  The report concluded that Labour's "ground campaign" during the election was strong but suggests many voters had already made their minds up and opinion polls suggesting it was neck and neck with the Conservatives were wrong.  Pollsters and activists on the doorstep consistently heard four reasons for the party's defeat, which saw it lose ground in key marginal seats in England and found itself all but wiped out in Scotland. They were:  On the issue of leadership, the report argues that Mr Miliband enjoyed a "surge" in 2015 and performed well during the campaign itself.  But it says he was unable to shift public perceptions, borne out in opinion polls, that David Cameron was regarded as more "prime ministerial".  "Over the period 2010-15, what the polls did consistently show was that, when asked if 'this man could be prime minister', David Cameron was rated above Ed Miliband. Since he actually was prime minister, this response was perhaps less than surprising.  "It is the fate of every Labour leader of the opposition to be the target of ferocious attack from partisans sections of the media," it added. "However, Ed Miliband faced an exceptionally vitriolic and personal attack."  The report says assumptions that Labour lost the election because it was too left-wing and because its policies were unpopular was overly simplistic and should be treated with caution, pointing out that the party's most radical initiatives - such as an energy price freeze and mansion tax on expensive properties - were among those most liked by the public.  But it says Labour lacked a consistent over-arching theme and struggled to communicate its approach to the voters in contrast to the "brutal simplicity of the Tories and UKIP".  "The reaction to the 2015 result was inevitably an emotional one for Labour because it was such a surprise," Dame Margaret said.  "There was certainly no complacency in the Labour ranks, but the polls showed us neck and neck with the Tories, when clearly we weren't.  "There are certainly lessons to learn from defeat. This report has been a key part of recognising areas we need to improve on and building on aspects of our campaign that performed well."  On the challenge facing Labour in 2020, the report concluded: "It is critically important for the country that Labour is able to win the 2020 election but we will face huge challenges. On current boundaries we need 94 gains to secure a majority of two.  "Were Labour to fail to recover in Scotland, it has been estimated that the swing required in England and Wales from the Tories to Labour would be 12.5% to secure an overall majority."  Shadow business secretary Angela Eagle said the party must pay close attention to the report as it sought to "remake its appeal", telling the BBC that Labour had come back from heavy defeats before and would do again.  But Tom Baldwin, Mr Miliband's former director of communications, said the current leadership had not given enough thought to why Labour lost. "Unless we start thinking about why we lost, we won't be able to win again," he told the BBC News Channel.  And the Conservatives said the report showed Labour "still haven't learnt the lessons from their economic mistakes" between 2005 and 2010, in relation to excessive levels of spending and borrowing.	politics

Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, said he would table "concrete proposals" for discussion at February's summit of EU leaders in Brussels.  Should a deal be reached, it would open the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership being held in June.  A poll must be held by the end of 2017, but the PM is thought to favour 2016.  Downing Street responded to Mr Tusk's comments by saying the process would be driven by "substance not schedule".  And a spokesman added: "But a deal in February would pave the way for getting on with this."  Mr Cameron is trying to negotiate a "better deal" for the UK in the European Union as a prelude to holding an in-out referendum on whether the UK should remain a member.  Negotiations are focused on four key areas: economic governance, sovereignty, competitiveness and curbs on EU migration to the UK.  Both sides are insisting progress is being made but that obstacles remain, particularly in relation to the UK's proposal for EU migrants to have to wait four years before being able to claim in-work benefits.  Holding a referendum in the first half of 2016 - which senior government ministers reportedly favour - effectively hinges on the other 27 EU members agreeing to the UK's proposals next month.  Mr Tusk, the former Polish prime minister who now chairs meetings of the European Council, has raised expectations of an agreement, tweeting that he would put forward detailed proposals in the run-up to the summit.  "I will work hard for deal in February, not easy but possible," he wrote. The European Council, he added, had "demonstrated willingness to look for compromises" in all four areas without "compromising fundamental values".  He told a plenary session of the European Parliament that a set of changes allowing the UK to remain in the EU was urgently needed.  The BBC's Brussels correspondent Ben Wright said months of intensive diplomacy between London, Brussels and EU capitals will come to a head when Mr Tusk circulates draft conclusions to which he hopes every leader will agree. While a deal was expected, he said it was not inevitable.  No 10 would not be drawn on the PM's preferred referendum date after Scottish Secretary David Mundell suggested there was no obstacle to it being held in June - a stance opposed by the SNP because of its proximity to May's elections to the Scottish Parliament.  Speaking on Tuesday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage predicted a weak compromise on the issue of migrant benefits. Citing the sexual assaults on German women in Cologne on New Year's Eve, he claimed the issue of border control and the safety of British women would be central to the referendum.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35347948	Election polling errors blamed on 'unrepresentative' samples	The failure of pollsters to forecast the outcome of the general election was largely due to "unrepresentative" poll samples, an inquiry has found.  The polling industry came under fire for predicting a virtual dead heat when the Conservatives ultimately went on to outpoll Labour by 36.9% to 30.4%.  A panel of experts has concluded this was due to Tory voters being under-represented in phone and online polls.  But it said it was impossible to say whether "late swing" was also a factor.  The majority of polls taken during last year's five-week election campaign suggested that David Cameron's Conservatives and Ed Miliband's Labour were neck-and-neck.  This led to speculation that Labour could be the largest party in a hung parliament and could potentially have to rely on SNP support to govern.  But, as it turned out, the Conservatives secured an overall majority in May for the first time since 1992, winning 99 more seats than Labour, their margin of victory taking nearly all commentators by surprise.  The result prompted the polling industry to launch an independent inquiry into the accuracy of their research, the reasons for any inaccuracies and how polls were analysed and reported.  An interim report by the panel of academics and statisticians found that the way in which people were recruited to take part - asking about their likely voting intentions - had resulted in "systematic over-representation of Labour voters and under-representation of Conservative voters".  These oversights, it found, had resulted in a "statistical consensus".  Most general election opinion polls are either carried out over the phone or on the internet. They are not entirely random - the companies attempt to get a representative sample of the population, in age and gender, and the data is adjusted afterwards to try and iron out any bias, taking into account previous voting behaviour and other factors.  But they are finding it increasingly difficult to reach a broad enough range of people. It is not a question of size - bigger sample sizes are not necessarily more accurate.  YouGov, which pays a panel of thousands of online volunteers to complete surveys, admitted they did not have access to enough people in their seventies and older, who were more likely to vote Conservative. They have vowed to change their methods.  Telephone polls have good coverage of the population, but they suffer from low response rates - people refusing to take part in their surveys, which can lead to bias.  How pre-election polls got it wrong  This, it said, was borne out by polls taken after the general election by the British Election Study and the British Social Attitudes Survey, which produced a much more accurate assessment of the Conservatives' lead over Labour.  NatCen, who conducted the British Social Attitudes Survey, has described making "repeated efforts" to contact those it had selected to interview - and among those most easily reached, Labour had a six-point lead.  However, among the harder-to-contact group, who took between three and six calls to track down, the Conservatives were 11 points ahead.  Former Liberal Democrat leader Lord Ashdown, who famously dismissed the election night exit poll with a promise to eat his hat if it was true, said the polls had a "considerable" impact on the way people voted.  He told BBC Radio 4's the World At One: "The effect of the polls was to hugely increase the power of the Conservative message and hugely decrease the power of the Liberal Democrat message, which was you need us to make sure they don't do bad things."  The peer claimed the "mood of the nation" was for another coalition and voters were "surprised" when the Conservatives won outright.  "I think, therefore, there is an argument to be made that it actually materially altered the outcome of the election."  Evidence of a last-minute swing to the Conservatives was "inconsistent", the polling experts said, and if it did happen its effect was likely to have been modest.  They also downplayed other potential explanations for why the polls got it wrong, such as misreporting of voter turnout, problems with question wording or how overseas, postal or unregistered voters were treated in the polls.  However, the panel said it could not rule out the possibility of "herding" - where firms configured their polls in a way that caused them to deviate less than could have been expected from others given the sample sizes. But it stressed that did not imply malpractice on behalf of the firms concerned.  Prof Patrick Sturgis, director of the National Centre for Research Methods at the University of Southampton and chair of the panel, told the BBC: "They don't collect samples in the way the Office for National Statistics does by taking random samples and keeping knocking on doors until they have got enough people.  "What they do is get anyone they can and try and match them to the population... That approach is perfectly fine in many cases but sometimes it goes wrong."  Prof Sturgis said that sort of quota sampling was cheaper and quicker than the random sampling done by the likes of the ONS, but even if more money was spent - and all of the inquiry's recommendations were all implemented - polls would still never get it right every time.  I remember the audible gasp in the BBC's election studio when David Dimbleby read out the exit poll results.  But for all that the consequences of that startling result were many and various, the reasons appear remarkably simple.  Pollsters didn't ask enough of the right people how they planned to vote. Proportionately they asked too many likely Labour voters, and not enough likely Conservatives  Politics is not a precise science and predicting how people will vote will still be a worthwhile endeavour. Political parties, journalists, and the public of course would be foolish to ignore them. But the memories and embarrassment for the polling industry of 2015 will take time to fade.  Read Laura's blog on how the pundits and pollsters got it wrong  Joe Twyman, from pollster YouGov, told the BBC it was becoming increasingly difficult to recruit people to take part in surveys - despite, in YouGov's case, paying them to do so - but all efforts would be made to recruit subjects in "a more targeted manner".  "So more young people people who are disengaged with politics, for example, and more older people. We do have them on the panel, but we need to work harder to make sure they're represented sufficiently because it's clear they weren't at the election," he said.  On Tuesday, the Lords approved a bill which would create a new watchdog to regulate future polling by specifying sampling methods, producing guidance on the wording of questions and deciding whether there should be a moratorium on polls in the run-up to elections.  But the private member's bill, tabled by Labour's Lord Foulkes, has yet to be introduced to the Commons and is unlikely to become law due to lack of parliamentary time.	politics

David Mundell said last week the UK government had no intention of re-introducing the previous scheme which was abolished in 2012.  But he told the Scottish Affairs committee the government was open to "reasonable suggestions".  Scottish minister Humza Yousaf said the UK government "was all over the place".  He added: "There is cross-sector and cross-party consensus in Scotland for the reintroduction of a post-study work visa.  "From universities and colleges right through to businesses and trade unions, it is widely recognised that giving the brightest minds from across the world the chance to work here after graduation will benefit Scotland economically, culturally and socially."  The Scottish government's Post-Study Work group said last year that the work visa should be reintroduced.  The Smith Commission, set up to look at more powers for Scotland following the independence referendum, said the Scottish and UK governments should explore the possibility of introducing "formal schemes to allow international higher education students graduating from Scottish further and higher education institutions to remain in Scotland".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35354942	GCHQ summer school will pay students £250 per week	UK intelligence agency GCHQ has announced it will pay £250 per week to students attending its Cyber Summer Schools this year.  Each course teaches students, who must be 18 or older when attending, about GCHQ's work to combat cyber-threats and helps them develop their "cyber-skills".  The schools are held at four sites in the UK, an increase from two last year.  The expansion was made following high demand for places, GCHQ has said.  One of the schools, Cyber Insiders, will give participants the chance to learn from a range of cybersecurity experts and will be held at Cheltenham from 4 July to 9 September.  Another, named Cyber Exposure, is targeted at students with a "natural curiosity for technology and problem-solving".  The Cyber Exposure courses will be held at sites in Scarborough, the Manchester area, and the Thames Valley between 11 July and 19 August.  "It is good that GCHQ is doing this, it increases the number of people that are learning about cybersecurity," cryptography expert Prof Mark Ryan, at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC.  "We do have a cybersecurity skills gap where we just aren't training enough people in cybersecurity."  The Cheltenham-based school is targeted specifically at first- and second-year students studying computer science, maths, physics or related subjects.  The other courses are open to students of any subject who have five GCSEs, including maths and English, who are also on track to achieve two A-levels at C grade or higher.  In a statement, GCHQ said that work at the summer schools would cover a wide range of technologies.  "Students will learn about GCHQ's role in defending the UK against cyber-threats whilst being paid £250 a week," the agency said.  Applications are now open at the GCHQ careers website.	tech

It was "different" because there was no lack of planning following the ousting of Colonel Gaddafi in 2011.  "We had plenty of planning but no power to implement the plans," he told the foreign affairs committee.  He said Colonel Gaddafi was to blame for the "sorry state" state of the country now.  "The responsibility for the state of Libya today rests with Colonel Gaddafi - in power for 40 years, with hollowed out institutions and no proper system of government under a tyrannical dictatorship," he told the committee.  "The longer that went on the longer there was going to be an explosion - if he was still there today then next year or the year after there would be the revolution."  He said the UK and its allies had tried to leave Libyans to sort out things out on their own, but should perhaps have taken a "more prescriptive approach".  Libya's new leaders wanted elections "as soon as they could" but should have been persuaded to take longer over the transition to democracy, suggested the former foreign secretary.  The UK led international efforts, with France, to get a UN resolution backing anti- Gaddafi forces and attempted to support the building of a stable democracy after the dictator had been ousted.  But the country rapidly descended into violence and instability, with two rival governments and the formation of hundreds of militias, some allied to so-called Islamic State.  Mr Hague told the MPs: "I think we have to be careful to think it's another Iraq. The problems are different to Iraq. The problem here is not that a lot of people didn't think about the post-conflict at the time.  "It was that, unlike in Iraq, they didn't have the power to implement what was decided, or what was planned, after the conflict."  Mr Hague said there was "some parallel" with Iraq because of the "hostility to Gaddafi era figures" being involved in the new government.  But they did need "some of those people" because "in a country with a small population they were the only people who had run any aspect of government in the previous 40 years".  Committee chairman, Conservative MP Crispin Blunt, asked if it was a "terrible misappreciation" to believe that "a country with no democracy, no politicians, and no civil society" could become a functioning democracy in nine months.  Lord Hague said "if it was a misappreciation then it was one that was shared with the Libyan leaders". He says that from his recollection the push for democracy came from within Libya rather than from the West.  Labour MP Yasmin Qureshi said she voted against military action in Libya at the time "because I foresaw exactly what would happen".  Ms Qureshi said "we just don't understand the Middle East and we should not be intervening militarily in these countries".  Lord Hague said he respected that viewpoint but "if you think slaughter is about to take place and you have the capability to do something then you should".  Speaking earlier to the same committee, Liam Fox, who sat alongside Lord Hague in the cabinet as defence secretary at the time of the conflict, said the main momentum for the intervention came from Paris rather than from London or Washington.  He said there was "no real appetite" among British military leaders to get involved in another conflict, as the UK was already involved in Iraq and Afghanistan at the time.  He had not been given advance warning of French air strikes, launched on 19 March 2011, hours after the UN resolution authorising them had been passed, he told the committee.  His own view was the the French were keen to show they were "serious players" in Nato again, given the "reticence" of the US government to get involved in Libya.  As for post-conflict planning, he said there had been concerns about a power vacuum developing and potential problems with guerrilla groups.  "There was a view that there was such a disparate grouping of rebels that some groups would have extremist elements, but I have no memory of any specific group being identified at the time."  He said the UK had offered the Libyan transitional government help with taking central control of militia groups but "nothing ever came of it".  There should have been more thought about what a "good outcome" for Libya would look like and to what extent the UK should be involved in delivering it, adding: "experience does add a great deal".	politics

Last year, users complained their phones had been damaged after accidentally placing the stylus in its holder upside down.  Initially, Samsung just told them to read the manual, updating the packaging to make these instructions clearer.  But now, it has told the Verge it has changed the "internal S-Pen mechanism".  "It is routine for manufacturers of smartphones to evolve the hardware to improve it during the life of a model," Ian Fogg, an analyst at consultants IHS, told the BBC.  Many consumer electronics products, such as games consoles, also evolved in this way, he said.  "For Samsung, the likely reason they've done this is that they've seen customers being caught out by the stylus and they've had returns coming back to them so they've tweaked their design and manufacturing to void the problem," Mr Fogg added.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35350789	Asda bug exposed online shopping payment details	A flaw on supermarket Asda's website gave hackers the chance to collect customers' personal information and payment details, the BBC has learned.  The US-owned retail firm, which processes upwards of 200,000 online orders each week, could have put more than 19 million transactions at risk, said security expert Paul Moore.  He first noticed the issue in March 2014 and contacted Asda to report it.  Asda said it had now fixed the problem and no customers had been affected.  The firm, whose website is run by US retail giant Walmart, told the BBC: "Asda and Walmart take the security of our websites very seriously. We are aware of the issue and have implemented changes to improve the security on our website."  "The points flagged pose a low risk to customers and our monitoring of these security issues indicate that no customer information has been compromised over that two-year period."  Since Mr Moore went public with the information it has acted to improve its security.  "The small risk to customer information has been removed and an update has been applied, we're now adding further enhancements which will be completed by this evening. In short, one of the two issues is fixed but nothing that remains poses any risk to any customer information or card details," it told the BBC.  The issue occurred because of two well-known exploits, cross-site scripting (XSS) and cross-site request forgery (CSRF), which combined, can offer hackers access to all the information users put on the site, said Mr Moore.  It means that - if someone had both the Asda website open and another site that is infected with malware - they could be vulnerable to attack.  "CSRF exploits the trust a site has in the user's browser, allowing an attacker to issue requests on your behalf and from your own PC. XSS allows an attacker to embed malicious content into the page to alter anything and everything the user can see," he explained.  Asda is by no means alone in having a website open to these security flaws but Mr Moore believes that it should have acted more quickly to rectify the problem.  "Back in March 2014, I contacted Asda to report several security vulnerabilities and despite a fix promised 'in the next few weeks', little appears to have changed," he said.  "Asda also failed to issue adequate security headers which help mitigate the risk by instructing the browser to discard content which ASDA deem malicious or unnecessary. The majority of modern browsers support content security policy (CSP) which effectively blocks this type of attack, but very few sites adopt this technique," he added.  When he published his blog, he advised users "to shop elsewhere".  "Asda/Walmart have had ample opportunity to fix these issues and have failed to do so. If you must continue shopping with Asda, open a private window and do not open any other tabs or windows until you've logged out," he added.  Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey, said that Asda's assertion that its site is secure is correct but that does not mean that users are not at risk.  "Cross-site scripting can easily be exploited by hackers if someone has a website open that has this malware embedded at the same time as they are shopping online and the shopping site has not protected the data entry fields appropriately," he said.  "Most people do have dozens of tabs open at any given time."  He did not go as far as suggesting people stop shopping there but added: "I think I'd play safe and make sure you have only one tab open just in case one of your other sites is infected."  "This is an example of of how companies need to look beyond the boundaries of their own website. This is a common exploit but it can be very easily fixed. It is half a line of code that can fix it," he added.  There are scanners available online that can immediately tell whether websites have the correct security headers.  One such site that scans the web for such headers found that, out of the million most popular websites, only 1,365 sites had them in place.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35344843	Government urged to use Bitcoin-style digital ledgers	The UK's chief scientific adviser has urged the government to adopt the technology that powers crypto-currency Bitcoin to run various public services.  Bitcoins are powered by blockchains - digital ledgers that record information from Bitcoin transactions to DNA.  Sir Mark Walport has argued that they could be used by government departments as a more secure way of managing data.  They could be used to help with tax collection, benefits or the issuing of passports, he has said.  Blockchains consist of "blocks" of data in a digital ledger.  Copies of these ledgers are shared by all the computers that access them, meaning they are distributed across the network.  Because blockchains act as permanent records of every time that data is added to them - and because private blockchains allow access to specific users only - they are thought to be highly resistant to malicious tampering.  Sir Mark's recommendation comes in the form of a new report which advocates the use of blockchains for a variety of services.  "Distributed ledger technologies have the potential to help governments to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the integrity of government records and services," the report says.  "In the NHS, the technology offers the potential to improve health care by improving and authenticating the delivery of services and by sharing records securely, according to exact rules."  Sir Mark added that existing approaches to data management in government departments typically involved large centralised systems with "a high cost single point of failure".  These systems may also be more vulnerable to hacking or errors, he wrote.  Using distributed ledgers and storing multiple copies of them is something that has helped been made possible by the improvement in computing technology, according to Dave Birch, at consultants Consult Hyperion.  "I think the report is really interesting," he told the BBC.  However, Mr Birch added that he was initially unsure of why blockchains - specific types of ledgers that require users to agree on the state of their contents - would be useful.  "When you say 'blockchain', that's a very specific kind of consensus protocol and one of the key reasons for using that is because there may be people trying to subvert [the data]," he said.  "I can see the report talks about distributed ledger technology in general. The issue is, can distributed ledgers help in certain kinds of government ledgers - the answer is almost certainly yes."  The report suggests that the British government should begin trials of distributed ledger technology to see how usable it is.  Some countries have already taken the step.  Texas-based firm Factom announced last year that it was working with Honduras to build a blockchain record of land registry titles - though the project later appeared to be on hiatus.  The report notes another example, Estonia, which already uses distributed ledger technology for citizens to check the integrity of their records on government databases.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35350361	Q&A: How do opinion polls work?	The 2015 general election result took political pollsters by surprise and a panel of experts has now said that, put simply, their predictions were wrong because they spoke to the wrong people.  But what exactly is polling, how does it work and why is it so hard to get the right answer?  In a nutshell, it's a scientific survey designed to measure the views of a particular group of people - for example, the UK electorate.  You don't have to eat an entire bowl of soup to know if it tastes good - if it's properly stirred, one spoonful is enough.  That's the analogy most commonly used to explain the principles behind polling - if you ask the right people, they can be relatively small in number but still give you an accurate representation of the views of everyone.  Well, anybody can carry out a survey, but those that pass muster - and reach a "scientific" standard - are done predominantly by reputable, independent polling companies. The 10 which featured most prominently in the 2015 general election were Ashcroft, ComRes, ICM, Ipsos MORI, Opinium, Panelbase, Populus, Survation, TNS and YouGov.  They carry out some polls independently while others are funded by media organisation. And then some are conducted on behalf of a partisan client - a particular political party, lobbying organisation, or interest group - who may be commissioning the survey because they expect a particular response and will only make the results public if the answers are to their liking.  The perfect option would be to obtain a genuinely random sample of people, but in reality that's nigh on impossible. You'd have to pick them from the electoral roll, but that doesn't have any phone numbers or email addresses, so you'd have to show up on the doorstep of every single one of them - and then they'd all have to agree to talk to you. Alternatively, you could send them all a letter but that would takes ages and the response rate would be very poor.  Instead, polling firms use something called quota sampling. It involves designing a sample of people that's representative of the population as a whole, with the right balance of gender, age, socio-economic background, and so on. Interviewers then have to go out and find them to tick each one of those boxes.  Results can also be weighted, so if you only manage to find 100 people aged 18 to 34, but needed to find 110, you can weight the response of each one of those you did find to count as 1.1 people in order to better reflect the population as a whole.  Most commonly, it's done over the phone or via the internet.  One of the biggest firms, YouGov, does its polls online. It has collected a panel of more than 360,000 people in a variety of ways - including via standard advertising. Then, when it needs to conduct a particular poll, it chooses a quota sample from that panel. Those people are then asked to fill in an online survey.  Ipsos MORI is one of the firms to use phone polling. Its explains that its call a combination of mobiles and landlines through random-digit dialling, which means they find ex-directory people as well as those in the phone book. The interviewer takes demographic details from whoever picks up so they can see where they fit in the quota sample.  Bear in mind though, that those who are unemployed, retired or work from home are more likely to answer the phone. And, as the UK Polling Report puts it: "There may also be attitudinal biases - people who are willing to give 20 minutes of their life to a stranger on the phone asking impertinent questions may have a different outlook on life to those who won't."  A biased sample of a million people is no better than a biased sample of a thousand. The bigger the scientific sample the better, but a polling company - and the entity paying for the poll - has to balance the cost and time involved with the accuracy of the result.  The more people you question the longer it takes and the more it costs - and if you're trying to track day-to-day changes in voter sentiment, it simply isn't practical to question vast numbers of people each time. A sample size of around 1,000 is often settled upon as a good balance.  An independent inquiry, commissioned by the British Polling Council and the Market Research Society, found that pollsters spoke to too many likely Labour voters and not enough likely Conservatives.  The biggest reason was that not enough older people - who are more likely to be Tory voters - were questioned.  Tory voters in general are also said by pollsters to be more likely to put the phone down or be ex-directory, and less likely to answer the door. And busy professionals who have less time to respond to polls are statistically more likely who vote Conservative.  Weighting should ease these sorts of problems, and has done in the past, but it appears it wasn't effective enough in 2015.  Those questioned were also more engaged in politics than average, which led the pollsters to make errors about the expected level of turnout among different groups. They knew that turnout would be higher among older voters than younger voters but they underestimated the difference.  Finally, the experts suggested there might have been "herding" - polling firms stuck together, not wanting to go out on a limb, so they designed their surveys and weighted their responses to fall closely in line with their rivals.  That they'll do better next time. They'll recruit more older people, rework their models to produce more accurate results. Joe Twyman, from YouGov, compared the situation to the Met Office after it failed to predict the 1987 hurricane. It went back to the drawing board, he said, found better ways to make predictions, and now generally speaking, people trust its forecasts again.  However, Ben Page, chief executive of Ipsos MORI, has made the point that resources are an issue. Just three of his 1,500 employees in London are doing election polling and the money available to do it is "miniscule" compared to what's spent on other sorts of research.  All the pollsters also point out that even a "perfect" random sample, conducted on an infinite budget, will, just by the laws of probability be outside the margin of error one time in 20.  It's rule one in the politician's handbook - always say you don't pay any attention to polls - but of course, the reality is quite different.  Labour MP Ben Bradshaw has accused the "commentariat" of being "too relaxed" about the pollsters' failure, saying he believes it affected the result of the election because all the talk in the run-up was about the all-but-inevitable hung parliament, meaning people voted on that basis.  Former Lib Dem minister Norman Lamb agrees, telling the BBC that endless talk of what would happen in the event of a hung parliament - particularly the doom-laden Tory warnings of an SNP-Labour tie-up - led people to vote "out of fear" for the Conservatives. He believes that if the polls had correctly predicted a Tory majority, people would have voted differently.  Some countries, France, Spain and Italy among them, ban all opinion polling for a defined period in the run-up to an election.  Following last May's vote, one Labour peer, Lord Foulkes, called for just such a ban in the UK, accusing newspapers of using polls as a tool to sway voters, creating a "bandwagon" for people to jump on rather than providing an independent assessment of the public mood.  The suggestion was dismissed by ComRes chief Andrew Hawkins who said it would be "bad for democracy" and, given the existence of social and other online media, an attempt to ban opinion polls would be pointless. He also said it was "insulting" to the electorate to suggest they'd be swayed by poll findings.	politics

Social platform Ask.fm has revealed the top 20 acronyms and slang terms used by its 150 million members, who are mostly teenagers and young adults.  Goat (Greatest Of All Time), Ootd (Outfit Of The Day), Pap (Post A Picture) and "Netflix and chill" (a hook-up) all made the list.  Bad means good, Savage means extremely good, No chill means irrational and Thot is a derogatory word for a woman.  The site allows anonymous chat and takes the form of a Q&A.  Anyone can pose a question or answer the questions of others.  "Teen language can experience a seismic shift with just a few clicks, texts or posts - and word or even symbol choices can literally change by the day," said Andrea Cutright, chief operating officer of the platform.  "Teens use our Q&A platform as a means to express themselves through dialogue, so we have our finger on the pulse of how teens talk - be it in the form of acronyms, new definitions or the latest emoji."  Tbr - to be rude (before writing something harsh)  Slept - knocking someone out, missing something good or being high  :3 - symbol which represents the cat-like face made by animal characters when they say something clever, sarcastic, or comment on something cute  A frog and coffee cup emojis together - I'm just saying...  Dime - a kind of approval rating on a score of 1-10  The fact that people can post anonymously has been blamed by some for encouraging online bullying.  The site introduced various safety measures, including the option for members to block anonymous comments, following a spate of teen suicides in 2013.  The high-profile suicide of 14-year-old British girl Hannah Smith was initially linked to abusive messages she received on Ask.fm, although a police investigation revealed that she appeared to have written them herself.  Platform owner Ask.com told the BBC that in 2014 it considered closing the service altogether.  "We came to the conclusion that there's a good business here as long as you make the service safer," said chief executive Doug Leeds.  "Our motto since we bought the company has been anonymity with responsibility."	tech

The position, in her Edmonton constituency office, will now be re-advertised with a £9.40 an hour salary.  "Kate does not believe in paying anyone less than the London Living Wage," a spokeswoman said.  Ms Osamor, who was promoted to Labour's front bench in Jeremy Corbyn's reshuffle, campaigns against low pay.  The original advertisement, on the W4MP jobs board, for a constituency intern, listed responsibilities including " community-based projects relating to the constituency", gathering and evaluating data and "general administrative support".  It asked for degree-level qualifications, "enthusiasm" and "commitment to the full duration of the role". The salary was listed as "expenses" and it was described as a "voluntary role".  The advert was withdrawn after Ms Osamor, who entered Parliament in May's general election, came under fire from campaigners. Tanya De Grunwald, a campaigner for fair internships and founder of careers website Graduate Fog said it was "astonishing" that MPs were still failing to connect the dots between their political principles and their own hiring practices.  Ms De Grunwald said it was "great" that the ad had been taken down but she said it was "disappointing that mistakes like this are still happening when surely everyone is aware of how unfair unpaid internships are by now. When you post an ad for an unpaid role you should know in your gut that it's wrong."  She said MPs needed to "sort out proper processes for hiring these roles so errors and misunderstandings like this can't happen".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35349081	UK should have listened to Ebola warnings, report says	The UK government should have paid more attention to warnings about Ebola before a formal emergency was declared, a group of MPs has said in a report.  A Commons committee said the government had been "too reliant" on the World Health Organisation (WHO) system, which declared an emergency in August 2014.  Instead it should have listened to other groups that were warning about Ebola months earlier, the report said.  But the government said its "swift and effective action" saved thousands.  The WHO has since set out plans to reform after health experts said its response to the outbreak was too slow.  The Ebola outbreak in West Africa was first reported in March 2014.  Some 11,315 people are reported to have died from the disease in six countries: Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Nigeria, the US and Mali.  The Commons' international development committee said groups like Medecins Sans Frontieres had raised the alarm about Ebola months before the WHO did.  The committee said the Department for International Development (DfID) "must ensure it has the ability to listen and react to information and warnings from a range of sources".  Instead it was "still relying too much on improvements on the international system without improving its own ability to independently assess international public health risks", the MPs concluded.  Committee chairman Stephen Twigg said: "The international community relied on WHO to sound the alarm for an international emergency on the scale of Ebola. The organisation's failure to respond quickly enough is now well documented.  "DfID operated effectively once the international response began in earnest.  "However, the department should have been able to pick up on warnings from sources beyond the established international system."  The committee also said it should be made easier for small sums of aid funding to be allocated after hearing from a doctor who was refused £7,500 in the early stages of the outbreak.  An inability to deal with small sums "may have hampered" the response, the report said, cautioning that "playing catch-up" usually proved more expensive.  Mr Twigg added: "It is vital that these lessons are learned as every delay counts. We urge DfID to lead efforts and make this reform a priority."  A DfID spokeswoman said the UK was "at the forefront of tackling this unprecedented epidemic" and this was "months before the first cases of Ebola were confirmed in Sierra Leone.  "We simultaneously pushed the international system to respond more quickly," she said.  "From rapidly deploying NHS medics and military personnel to building treatment centres, our swift and effective action helped save thousands of lives and contain the spread of the disease.  "Our flexible response is now ensuring Sierra Leone can isolate and treat new cases of Ebola before they spread."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35343561	Bitcoin: Is the crypto-currency doomed?	A high-profile Bitcoin developer has said the crypto-currency has failed and he will no longer take part in its development.  Mike Hearn, a Zurich-based developer and long-time proponent of Bitcoin, surprised many this weekend when he published a blog calling Bitcoin a "failed" project.  Mr Hearn, who had until recently been working on new software for the currency, says he has now sold all of his own bitcoins and will no longer take part in the crypto-currency's development.  Bitcoin is a crypto-currency - a system of digitally created and traded tokens to which value is assigned.  Computers have to solve cryptographic problems in order to add blocks to the blockchain - a ledger that records every transaction that has ever occurred with Bitcoin.  In return, those computers receive bitcoins in a process known as bitcoin "mining".  Users have a "bitcoin address", to which bitcoins may be sent or from which they may be used.  Addresses are stored online in wallets that function like bank accounts.  Although most people refer to Bitcoin as a currency, it is worth noting that for regulatory reasons many countries - including the United States - have decided to define it as a commodity instead.  The biggest issue most bitcoin users acknowledge is how quickly new transactions can be processed.  The size of blocks being added to the blockchain has been increasing steadily with the rise of Bitcoin.  As a result, the rate at which transactions can be processed has been slowing.  Some fear the network will eventually become oversaturated and cease to be usable.  Mike Hearn is a software developer who has worked on Bitcoin technologies for over five years.  In 2014, he left his job at Google to focus on Bitcoin full time.  He has worked closely with Bitcoin chief scientist Gavin Andresen on alternative software for Bitcoin called Bitcoin XT, which aims to address capacity issues facing the network.  Mr Andresen is generally thought of as next in the chain of influence over the currency's development after Bitcoin's mysterious founder, Satoshi Nakamoto.  Currently, each block can be no more than 1MB.  But in May last year, Mr Andresen said bigger ones should be adopted.  He later wrote, "It is more likely people [will] just stop using Bitcoin because transaction confirmation becomes increasingly unreliable."  The Bitcoin XT version developed by Mr Hearn, Mr Andresen and others offers to increase the block size limit to 8MB  There are alternatives, however.  Nic Cary, co-founder of Bitcoin start-up Blockchain, points to BitcoinClassic, which would increase the block size limit to 2MB.  Bitcoin's history as a "decentralised" currency has led to much hesitation over decisions that might change its fundamental nature.  Any proposal relating to Bitcoin is likely to encourage fierce debate and, in some cases, stagnation.  Some have argued vehemently against Bitcoin XT, causing a deep divide in the community. The New York Times has reported that death threats had even been made against some Bitcoin developers.  Mr Cary says the need to update the block size limit is not as urgent as some say.  "This is a matter of perspective," he told the BBC.  "The Bitcoin network has been updated safely dozens of times and will continue to be the most reliable, affordable, and efficient way to send value around the world."  However, there are some who feel that Bitcoin's potential as a currency has already been exhausted.  "I'm sure there are smart people right now working out what the next generation [of Bitcoin] should look like but I have to say I'm not convinced that money or payments is the optimum [use] of the technology," Dave Birch, a director at consultancy firm Consult Hyperion, told the BBC.  Part of the problem was the lack of consensus over what Bitcoin was and how it should be used, he added.  Bitcoin's price fell quite sharply over the weekend, following the publication of Mr Hearn's blog.  One bitcoin is now worth $380 (£265), down from about $430 on Thursday.  However, the price of Bitcoin is notoriously volatile.  It has been classed as the best performing currency in the world in 2015.  But authors of that analysis, The Money Project, also noted it was the worst performing currency the previous year.  Besides price, Bitcoin has also suffered from a litany of cases in which bitcoins have been stolen from online exchanges in which they were stored, in some cases due to negligence or poor security.  Such incidents generally result in a complete loss of funds for the victims, since it is very difficult to trace where stolen bitcoins have been transferred.  Meanwhile, the currency continues to grow - a sign of good things to come, say many.  There is still huge interest in developing both the currency and technologies based on the blockchain idea of recording data.  It seems unlikely the currency will collapse overnight.  But it certainly look as though fundamental questions over how Bitcoin works are now coming to a head.  Whether the community that uses and supports Bitcoin will be able to come to a consensus on these matters remains to be seen.  Mr Hearn has lost faith in the project, of that there is no doubt.  But many others are refusing to throw in the towel just yet.	tech

In a report into cobalt mining in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it found children as young as seven working in dangerous conditions.  The firms said that they had a zero tolerance policy towards child labour.  The DRC produces at least 50% of the world's cobalt. Miners working in the area face long-term health problems and the risk of fatal accidents, according to Amnesty.  It claimed that at least 80 miners had died underground in southern DRC between September 2014 and December 2015.  It also collected the testimonies of children who allegedly work in the mines.  Paul, a 14-year-old orphan, started mining when he was 12 and told researchers: "I would spend 24 hours down in the tunnels. I arrived in the morning and would leave the following morning ... I had to relieve myself down in the tunnels … My foster mother planned to send me to school, but my foster father was against it, he exploited me by making me work in the mine."  UNICEF estimates that there are approximately 40,000 children working in mines across southern DRC.  In response to the report, Apple said: "Underage labour is never tolerated in our supply chain and we are proud to have led the industry in pioneering new safeguards."  It said that it conducts rigorous audits on its supply chain and any supplier found hiring underage workers is forced to:  On cobalt specifically it added: "We are currently evaluating dozens of different materials, including cobalt, in order to identify labour and environmental risks as well as opportunities for Apple to bring about effective, scalable and sustainable change."  Samsung said that it had a "zero tolerance policy" towards child labour and that, it too, conducted regular and rigorous audits of its supply chain.  "If a violation of child labour is found, contracts with suppliers who use child labour will be immediately terminated," it said.  Sony commented: "We are working with the suppliers to address issues related to human rights and labour conditions at the production sites, as well as in the procurement of minerals and other raw materials."  The Amnesty report, which was jointly researched with African Resources Watch (Afrewatch), traced how traders buy cobalt from areas where child labour is rife, selling it on to firm Congo Dongfang Mining (CDM), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Chinese mineral giant Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Ltd.  Amnesty contacted 16 multinationals who were listed as customers of the battery manufacturers, who in turn source minerals from Huayou Cobalt.  One company admitted the connection while four others were unable to say for certain the source of the cobalt they used. Five denied sourcing the mineral from the firm, despite being listed as customers in company documents and two others said that they did not source cobalt from DRC.  Six firms said that they were investigating the claims.  "It is a major paradox of the digital era that some of the world's richest, most innovative companies are able to market incredibly sophisticated devices without being required to show where they source raw materials for their components," said executive director of Afrewatch (Africa Resources Watch) Emmanuel Umpula.  "The abuses in mines remain out of sight and out of mind because in today's global marketplace, consumers have no idea about the conditions at the mine, factory and assembly line. We found that traders are buying cobalt without asking questions about how and where it was mined."  Mark Dummett, business and human rights researcher at Amnesty said that mining was "one of the worst forms of child labour".  "The glamorous shop displays and marketing of state of the art technologies are a stark contrast to the children carrying bags of rocks and miners in narrow man-made tunnels risking permanent lung damage," he said.  "Millions of people enjoy the benefits of new technologies but rarely ask how they are made. It is high time the big brands took some responsibility for the mining of the raw materials that make their lucrative products.  "Companies whose global profits total $125bn (£86.7bn) cannot credibly claim that they are unable to check where key minerals in their productions come from," he said.  It should be noted that the majority of the children working in the mining industry in DRC do not enter the underground mines but perform a variety of tasks on the surface, including scavenging for ore and sorting minerals that have been mined underground.	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35345279	Donald Trump debate: Ban risks making tycoon a 'martyr'	Stopping Donald Trump from coming to the UK risks turning him into a martyr, a Labour MP has claimed during a three-hour House of Commons debate.  Paul Flynn said Mr Trump's call to ban Muslims from the US was "extremely dangerous" but barring him from the UK risked being seen as anti-American.  However, SNP MP Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh said a ban would be justified on the grounds of "religious harmony".  Monday's debate, which took place in a packed Westminster Hall committee room, ended without a vote.  Home Office minister James Brokenshire said the government had the power to exclude people who would "do harm" but the US was the UK's most important ally and the UK should "engage" with presidential candidates even when it "profoundly disagreed" with their views.  The tycoon, who is leading several opinion polls in the race to be the Republican candidate for President, called for a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the US in response to the shooting of 14 people in San Bernardino, California in December.  Mr Trump's comments were criticised across the political spectrum in the US and Europe. He caused further anger by claiming that areas of London and other parts of the UK have become so radicalised that they have become no-go areas for the police.  The "Ban Trump" petition states that the UK "has banned entry to many individuals for hate speech" and argues that the rules must be "fairly applied to the rich as well as poor".  A counter-petition, also being debated although it has not reached the 100,000 signature mark, argues that foreign nationals should not be banned "for their opinions on domestic actions" and a ban would risk damaging US-UK relations given the possibility of a Trump victory in November's election.  Opening the debate in a crowded chamber, Mr Flynn said it would be wrong to ignore the ban petition, given that the "public was speaking with such a loud voice" and insisted the debate was not an attempt to "disrespect Americans or the American state".  He said some of those who signed the petition believed that Mr Trump's comments had incited acts of violence in the US.  Listing the names of some of those who had been banned by the UK authorities in recent years he said the risk of a ban would be that it would increase the publicity surrounding Mr Trump "100-fold".  Mr Trump's "prejudice" should be countered by "reasonableness, hospitality and courtesy", Mr Flynn told MPs. "We should not build him up by our attacks," he said.  "The great danger by attacking this one man is that we can fix on him a halo of victimhood," he said. "We give him the role of martyrdom which can seem to be an advantage among those who support him."  Tory MP Andrew Murrison said Mr Trump was a "ridiculous" figure but to ban someone who had a chance of becoming US President could be construed as an "almighty snub" to the US.  Fellow Conservative Sir Edward Leigh said the UK had invited despots to the UK in the past who had done "far, far worse than anything Donald Trump can dream of" and he warning against "shutting down an honest debate about immigration".  But, backing a ban, Labour MP Tulip Siddiq said Mr Trump's words "risks inflaming tensions between vulnerable communities" and those calling for this "poisonous and corrosive" man to be barred were speaking in "good conscience".  "I draw the line with freedom of speech when it actually imports violent ideology," she said.  "The legislation exists to protect the public and the people of Britain from individuals such as this... the same rules need to apply to Donald Trump."  Labour MP Jack Dromey: "I don't think Donald Trump should be allowed within 1,000 miles of our shores....Donald Trump is free to be a fool but he is not free to be a dangerous fool in Britain."  Labour MP Naz Shah: "I would give Donald Trump an open invitation to visit my constituency... I would invite him for a curry. I would welcome him, have a conversation with him and challenge him on his views."  Conservative MP Sir Edward Leigh: "Like it or not, he is quite a contender to be the head of state of the most powerful country on the planet, a country which is a vital ally of ours. We have welcomed to the country Saudi and Chinese leaders, not to mention Mr Ceausescu, whose crimes are far worse than anything Mr Trump can dream up."  Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston: "I would argue that should Donald Trump be excluded from one of the United States' oldest allies, it would send a very clear message to the people of the US about what we feel about those who demonise an entire people for no other reason apart from their religion."  The SNP's Ms Ahmed-Sheikh said Mr Trump's comments made the UK an "uncomfortable place" for her and other Muslims to live in.  "The home secretary has explicitly excluded 84 people for hate speech. My view is that Donald Trump should be number 85."  The UK home secretary has the power to ban people from entering the country on grounds of national security, if they are thought likely to incite racial hatred or if they are deemed not to be "conducive to the public good".  Ahead of the debate, Trump International Links Scotland issued a statement saying MPs should be spending their time debating the problems facing the Scottish and UK economies.  "For the UK to consider banning someone who made a statement in America, about American borders during a US election campaign is ridiculous," said Sarah Malone, the company's executive vice president.  "Westminster is creating a dangerous precedent on this issue and is sending a terrible message to the world."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35343091	Friends Reunited website to close down	Friends Reunited - one of the UK's first social networks - has announced it will soon close.  One of its founders Steve Pankhurst explained in an email that the platform was still used by "a handful of members" but that it was "no longer used for the purpose it was built for".  Friends Reunited launched in the year 2000 and was bought by broadcaster ITV for £175m ($250m) in 2005.  However, it failed to keep pace with other social networks.  It was sold to comic publisher DC Thompson for only £25m in 2009 and Mr Pankhurst wrote in a blog post that the company had offered it back to him a couple of years ago.  Pankhurst and business partner Jason Porter agreed to take on the site for a trial period to see if they could revitalise it.  "It became clear that most of the actual users coming to the site were using it purely as a messageboard," wrote Mr Pankhurst.  "And I also realised that of the more than 10 million users registered, a lot had done so over a decade ago and hence their contact details were out of date.  "But importantly - it hasn't covered its costs and like any business this can't continue indefinitely.  "Therefore, whilst it's sad, I believe it's time to move on and put Friends Reunited to bed."  Mr Pankhurst is now planning to launch a new service called Liife. This will be somewhere for people to plot key moments in their lives, but only to share them with those who were involved rather than a wider audience.  However, social media consultant Sue Llewellyn warned: "The market is incredibly crowded with all of these things and I honestly can't see there is space for it.  "I understand totally about the privacy side - privacy is a big thing and it's getting bigger - but I can't see a need for Liife.  "I really wish them luck and I'm happy to eat my virtual hat if it works."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35343089	New Doom level released by game creator John Romero	John Romero, one of the developers behind the seminal computer game Doom, has released his first new level for the title in 21 years.  He is offering the new material for free via the file-sharing site Dropbox.  Mr Romero told the BBC he had made it as a "warm up" for a new project.  Doom was released in 1993 and had 10 million players by 1995. It has retained a cult popularity, and still has a dedicated community of players who also create their own content.  The source code - the computer program that powers the game, written in a human-readable computer language - has been available for some time.  As a result, Mr Romero estimates there are about 30 alternative versions of the entire game, and more than 100,000 add-on levels created by Doom fans.  "Every day people are still making new levels for it," he said.  His new level, Tech Gone Bad, is a boss level that offers an alternative climactic fight.  It ends in a massive complex with a huge computer room that links to different portals and "hell cracks" in the floor, he said.  The original final level was made by the developer Sandy Peterson and not Mr Romero.  The new version is mostly based outdoors.  Mr Romero said that distinguished it from the original game, which was largely based on indoor play, with the exception of Mount Erebus in level six (E3M6 in the Doom register).  "Doom mapping is pretty easy to do compared with 3D engines," Mr Romero said of his own creation.  "But I did worry... the community that's been playing it for 20 years would tear [the new level] apart."  However the reaction from players has been positive, he added.  "It's been out for four days and it's exploded. It's crazy that a game that's 23 years old has so many people still super-excited about it."  He added he had no idea Doom would become such a perennial favourite back in the early 1990s.  "With Doom, it was mouse and keyboard-controlled on the PC when it was released, and you can still play it that way," he said.  "People remember how much fun they had a long time ago and I hope they will have that much fun again."	tech

Earlier this month, Dutch police told the BBC they had decrypted messages on Blackberrys modified by third parties.  Blackberry has now said the message recovery, if there was any, could be down to third-party applications or the insecure practices of users.  It prides itself on providing one of the most secure means of communication.  World leaders, including US President Barack Obama, have been pictured using the company's devices.

It is those PGP Blackberrys the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) said it had been able to crack.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35337432	Corbyn: UK could keep Trident submarines but without warheads	Jeremy Corbyn has suggested the UK could keep its Trident submarine fleet but without carrying nuclear warheads.  The Labour leader told the Andrew Marr show that protecting defence jobs was his "first priority" and there were "options" for doing this while taking a lead in global nuclear "de-escalation".  Labour, which is split over the issue of renewing Trident, has said the idea is similar to one adopted by Japan.  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Labour would weaken the UK's defences.  In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Corbyn also said:  Mr Corbyn is at odds with many of his MPs over the future of the UK nuclear weapons system - which the government has estimated will cost £31bn to renew - and has commissioned a review led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry to look at its future, likely to report in the summer.  The Labour leader has been a longstanding opponent of Trident but some MPs and peers have threatened to resign if Labour reverses its decades-long support for the nuclear deterrent.  Parliament is to hold a vote later this year on whether to proceed with building successor submarines to the existing Vanguard fleet, which is due to become obsolete by the end of the next decade.  Set aside the technicalities; Labour's Trident debate will be a test of political strength.  Ordering new submarines without nuclear weapons could make for a long term compromise, between Jeremy Corbyn and the unions at least.  But - as he makes clear - his views on those weapons aren't changing. Neither are those of his critics.  And - crucially - Parliament will make the main decision on Trident long before the end of Labour's policy review and its party conference.  So the leader, chief whip and shadow cabinet will have to decide whether or not to order Labour MPs to oppose the government.  All the while, ministers are confident of winning the Trident vote, whatever the opposition does.  And some Conservatives who think opposing nuclear weapons makes the opposition look weak are keen on a vote before the May elections.  Unite leader Len McCluskey has urged Mr Corbyn to give MPs a free vote on the issue, as happened over military action in Syria.  Mr Corbyn told the BBC that Trident was a relic from a "Cold War generation" and he did not believe David Cameron would ever contemplate using it.  Asked, in that case, what was the point of having at least one submarine on constant patrol, he said: "They don't have to have warheads on them."  He added: "If anyone uses a nuclear weapon it is catastrophic for the whole globe... There are options there."  Since 1969, according to government documents, a British submarine carrying nuclear weapons has always been on patrol, gliding silently beneath the waves, somewhere in the world's oceans.  The logic is to deter a nuclear attack on the UK because, even if the nation's conventional defence capabilities were destroyed, the silent submarine would still be able to launch a catastrophic retaliatory strike on the aggressor, a concept known as mutually assured destruction.  The submarines carry up to 16 Trident missiles; each can be fitted with a number of warheads, which can be directed at up to 12 different targets.  Read more about the history of the UK's nuclear deterrent  Union leaders have warned that scrapping Trident could devastate communities reliant on the defence industry and Mr Corbyn said he recognised the need to retain "amazing skills and technology".  Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who backs the abolition of Trident, told a Unite conference in Clydebank that any decision to do so "must be matched by a programme of diversification and alternative employment".  "That is the position that the Scottish Parliament supported in November and that is the position that we [the SNP] will advocate."  Ms Thornberry said the idea of submarines equipped with conventional warheads, but with the potential to have a nuclear capability, was a posture adopted by Japan.  She told Sunday Politics that it was "certainly one option that is available to us and one thing that needs to be looked at".  But John Woodcock, the MP for Barrow in Furness - where the Vanguard fleet was built - said the idea was "implausible", adding: "Having a deterrent that has no capacity to deter is like having an army with broken rifles and no ammunition."  However, former minister and senior backbencher Keith Vaz said he had changed his mind on Trident.  "I think Jeremy Corbyn has persuaded me. He has made it very clear when he is prime minister that he is not going to be able to use these weapons, so what is the point in having them?" he told Russia Today.  Mr Corbyn, who outlined plans on Saturday to cap levels of executive pay and stop firms which don't pay a living wage from paying dividends, rejected suggestions he was talking only to people who agreed with him.  He said he wanted to "reach out to everybody", including Conservative voters.  He said he backed repealing legislation passed by the Thatcher government in the 1980s banning so-called secondary strike action, where unions walk out in sympathy with other workers already on strike.  Such action, he said, was "legal in other countries" and he asked whether he would legalise it, he replied, "Yes, of course."  The Conservatives said Mr Corbyn's pronouncements showed Labour were a threat to "the security of every working family".  "Labour would weaken Britain's defences by having a nuclear deterrent without any nuclear weapons, and would weaken our economy by changing the law to increase the number of disruptive strikes," said Mr Fallon.	politics

The US Presidential candidate must be treated the same as anyone else making anti-Muslim remarks, the ex-SNP leader said, and a ban would "do him good".  MPs will debate a petition on Monday urging action against Mr Trump after he called for Muslims to be denied entry to the US on counter-terrorism grounds.  Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Trump should be able to visit the UK and see the contribution made by Muslims.  The tycoon's call for a temporary ban on Muslims, which he made in response to the deadly shootings in San Bernardino in December, were criticised across the political spectrum in the US and Europe.  He caused further anger by claiming that areas of London and other parts of the UK have become so radicalised that they have become no-go areas for the police.  Despite the political backlash, Mr Trump is still leading several opinion polls in the race to be the Republican candidate for November's election ahead of the first primary contest next month.  Mr Trump, who owns the Turnberry golf course among other assets in Scotland, has threatened to cancel £700m of planned investment if he is blocked from returning to the UK.  But the former Scottish first minister, who once courted Mr Trump but whose relationship with him has deteriorated in recent months and who has been involved in a war of words with the tycoon, said he believed there were grounds for excluding him.  "What should happen is that the home secretary should consider Donald Trump's remarks in the same way as she consider the remarks of hundreds of other people and she should do it with exactly the same criteria.  "My view is that, yes, I would probably ban "The Donald" because it would do him some good. He wants to ban all Muslims from the US. I want to ban all Donald Trumps from Scotland."  The UK home secretary has the power to ban people from entering the UK on grounds of national security, if they are thought likely to incite racial hatred or if they are deemed not to be "conducive to the public good".  Theresa May has banned more than 200 people since 2010, according to figures published last year, although she has declined to comment on whether Mr Trump could be added to the list.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has joined prime minister David Cameron in opposing a ban, telling the BBC that although Mr Trump's views were "weird and off-the-wall", he would benefit from seeing first-hand how Muslims were treated in the UK and their contribution to British society.  "I decided to invite Donald Trump on his visit to Britain to come with me to my constituency because he has problems with Mexicans and he has problems with Muslims," he told the Andrew Marr Show.  "As you know my wife is Mexican and my constituency is very, very multi-cultural so what I was going to do was go down to the mosque with him and let him talk to people there."  He added: "I don't think we should ban people from coming to Britain on that basis. I think he should come here and have a lesson in going to all our cities. Why can't he go to Leicester, Birmingham and Newcastle and see that we have great diversity in our society."  More than 573,000 have signed the petition calling for Mr Trump to be banned from the UK. MPs will debate the petition, and a counter-petition criticising a ban signed by more than 42,000 people for three hours on Monday, starting at 16.30 GMT.	politics

It was suggested to him, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, that the current action by junior doctors would be more effective if the ban was ended.  "Sympathy action is legal in most other countries, it should also be legal here," Mr Corbyn said.  The Tories said the remarks show Labour is a "threat" to economic security.  Asked if he would end the ban on secondary strike action - also known as solidarity action - brought in by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1990, Mr Corbyn said: "Yes, of course".  He added: "Nobody willingly goes on strike. They go on strike as an ultimate weapon... So let's look at the causes of people being upset rather than the symptoms."  Mr Corbyn also did not rule out allowing the return of flying pickets - where workers travels to support others' action - which were first used in the coal disputes of the 1970s.  He said: "It was merely people moving around showing support during a very difficult industrial dispute."  Referring to the walkout by junior doctors in their dispute with the government about a new contract, Mr Corbyn said they "would be better served if we had a health secretary who was prepared to get involved, meet them and look for a solution".  There were calls for the laws on secondary strikes to be repealed in 2005 while Labour was in power, amid action by baggage handlers at Heathrow Airport in support of sacked staff at the catering firm Gate Gourmet. However, the government then ruled out the prospect of lifting the ban.  The issue re-emerged three years later but then Prime Minister Gordon Brown said there would be "no return" to past laws.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35330331	Jeremy Corbyn warns businesses over 'unfair' pay	A Labour government could ban companies from paying dividends to shareholders unless they pay workers the living wage, Jeremy Corbyn has said.  He said in a speech to a think tank too much profit from economic growth had gone to those at the top of society.  The Labour leader was explaining his strategy to tackle pay inequality and "institutionalise fairness" in Britain.  He later told the Unite union in Scotland the Tories wanted to "tip the scales further" in favour of bosses.  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said Mr Corbyn "seems committed on ripping apart our business sector in pursuit of an egalitarian fantasy". A Conservative Party spokesman called Labour a "clear threat to our economic security".  Addressing the left-of-centre Fabian Society, Mr Corbyn said: "Only profitable employers will be paying dividends; if they depend on cheap labour for those profits then I think there is a question over whether that is a business model to which we should be turning a blind eye."  CBI chief of staff Matthew Fell said: "The idea of politicians stepping into the relationship between a private company and its shareholders would be a significant intervention, and not one that we would support."  Almost six million workers in the UK are currently paid less than the living wage - an informal benchmark promoted by the Living Wage Foundation, which is currently £8.25 an hour and £9.40 in London.  The government has announced a compulsory National Living Wage for people over 25 starting at £7.20 an hour in April this year, with a target of reaching more than £9 an hour by 2020.  Mr Corbyn said imposing "pay ratios" between those at the top and those at the bottom of a company's pay scale could be another option for creating a fairer society.  He said: "A more equal society is not only fairer, it does better in terms of economic stability and wealth creation."  The Labour leader also used his speech to attack the Conservatives, accusing them of "running the state into the ground" for ideological reasons.  "Their concept of fairness is of a very different order to ours," he said. "Fairness for only a few is not fairness, but privilege."  In his address to Unite's Scottish conference in Glasgow, Mr Corbyn repeated his call, saying companies should "pay the living wage to the workers first and the dividend later on".  He also said a future Labour government would repeal the Trade Union Bill currently going through Parliament, and extend employees' rights.  Mr Corbyn repeated his promise to renationalise the railways, which he said would bring down fares.  And he said the way to cut energy bills for consumers and transition to carbon-free energy was to restore "democratic control" of the energy companies.  Seema Malhotra, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC Mr Corbyn was not announcing "something that is Labour policy" adding "it was an idea" to provoke debate.  Mr Corbyn had said party members and supporters would decide whether his proposals were worth adopting.  "Our... membership has doubled since that [general election] defeat in May; our party is in a process of regenerating - a difficult process of adjustment for us all at times, but a huge opportunity to breathe life into all sections of the party and draw on the collective wisdom of all."  BBC News politics reporter Matt Cole said the speech was a way for Mr Corbyn to regain the political initiative following the shadow cabinet reshuffle over which three of his front-bench team resigned.  He said the "most eye-catching plan", the proposals on dividends, received a warm welcome from Labour supporters happy to move on from what may have seemed like unending internal party rows.

The review, to be led by shadow defence secretary Emily Thornberry, will feed into a wider review on the UK's global role that Mr Livingstone will chair.  Ms Thornberry said the defence element would be "based on the evidence" and take into account differing views.  She said she was aiming to publish an interim report by June.  This would enable Labour's National Policy Forum to consider policy on Trident prior to the party conference in September - at which party members could vote to overturn decades of support for nuclear weapons.  The BBC's Carole Walker said it had been assumed that Mr Livingstone would play a leading role in the review of Labour's policy on whether to renew Britain's nuclear weapons.  The former Mayor of London said he was "happy" with the part he was playing and said he and Ms Thornberry - who became defence spokeswoman in a reshuffle earlier this month - were in "complete agreement" on the issue.  Mr Livingstone and Ms Thornberry are opposed to the UK's nuclear weapon system as is Jeremy Corbyn but many Labour MPs support it.  Labour's official policy since the late 1980s has been to keep Trident but supporters of Mr Corbyn want to change it at the party conference later this year, arguing that weapons will never be used and its multibillion pound cost cannot be justified.  The Labour leader has promised to give party members a say over the decision.  However, this could prompt a backlash from senior MPs - including several members of the shadow cabinet - who believe a nuclear deterrent is essential to the UK's national security and place in the world.  Mr Livingstone's involvement in the process has provoked criticism from some Labour MPs as he has been highly critical of supporters of Trident in the party and has not held elected office since stepping down as Mayor of London in 2008.  Setting out the terms of reference for the review, Ms Thornberry said it would examine the "whole range of defence challenges", not merely Trident, and how best to respond to the threats facing the British people.  It is expected there will be public meetings and seminars as part of the efforts to gather evidence from academics, military personnel, families, party members and other interested parties.  Read more: A guide to Trident and the debate about its replacement  "This will be a comprehensive review of Britain's defence challenges and options for the 21st century," she said. "It will be open, transparent and inclusive, and its conclusions will be based on the evidence.  "At every stage of the process, we will give full scope to the wide range of views on this subject in an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust."  While she would approach the review with an "open mind," she said she was "extremely sceptical" about the grounds for retaining Trident and would "not be afraid to ask some really difficult questions".  She insisted the review "would take as long as it takes" but that, if need be, would publish interim findings to "feed" into discussions at the National Policy Forum, expected to take place in July.  The BBC's political correspondent Carole Walker said there was no intention to prioritise or separate Trident policy from the wider defence review.  Ms Thornberry's review of the party's defence policy will feed into a wider review of Labour's foreign policy on which Mr Livingstone will be co-convenor along with the shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn. Work has yet to start on the wider policy review on Britain in the World.  MPs will vote at some point this year on whether to proceed with the building of a new generation of Vanguard nuclear submarines, to replace the existing fleet which will become obsolete by the end of the 2020s.  Former Labour defence minister, Lord West, said he would quit the party if it decided not to support Trident, telling Daily Politics the "British public believe in the deterrent" and a policy of unilateralism would be "disastrous".  And the head of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said it would be making a "very strong case" to Labour about the role Trident played in supporting jobs in communities across the UK.  "Our members will be reassured by the scope and calendar of this review because it is evidently designed to ensure that all voices are heard in this important process," he said.	politics

The English language version of the site, which can anyone can edit, has more than five million entries and has been edited around 808 million times.  A page about former US president George W Bush has attracted the most attention with 45,862 edits since its creation.  Britney Spears, Adolf Hitler and a list of programmes broadcast by Asian TV channel ABS-CBN also make the top 15.  At the end of Wikipedia's first year, the most edited entry was about Creationism - the religious belief that life is a divine creation - with 179 edits, noted Jeff Elder and Ed Herhard from the Wikimedia Foundation in a blog post.  To date the entire site has been edited 808,187,367 times by Wikipedia's vast community.  The most edited story of 2015 was a page about notable deaths - but the second, an obscure page titled "geospatial summary of the High Peaks/Summits of the Juneau Icefield" was edited more than 7,000 times by one person.  Founder Jimmy Wales recently told the BBC that Wikipedia had a difficult birth.  "The first version of Wikipedia was called Nupedia," he said.  "It was very top-down, very structured. I beat my head against the wall for two years, I knew the system was too complicated, but I didn't want to fail."  The Wikimedia Foundation, which runs Wikipedia, used the site's birthday to announce an endowment scheme to ensure a permanent source of funding for the site and says it hopes to raise $100m (£69m) in the next 10 years.  The site regularly asks for voluntary donations from readers and in 2014 raised $75.5m from 4.9m donors around the world, according to its own report.  On 3 December 2014 it received a record $29 (£20) per second, raising more than $2.5m (£1.7m) in one day.  Wikipedia sometimes hits the headlines when people make amusing edits to topical pages - but Jimmy Wales takes a dim view.  "If you wanna do something for your friends, click at it, make the funny change and just hit the preview button and just take a screenshot of that and you don't have to bother the rest of the world with your joke," he told BBC's Newsbeat in 2014.  Aleksi Aaltonen, assistant professor of information systems at Warwick Business School, said the site had come of age.  "The controversy and excitement that surrounded the service in the early days has passed," Mr Aaltonen said.  "As Wikipedia has grown older, it has become progressively more difficult for contributors to improve content. At the same time, Wikipedia's system of rules has become more burdensome.  "However, if Wikipedia can maintain its success, it will be remembered as a gift of an open internet that is now under attack from many directions."	tech

The list includes Hyatt premises in Canada, the US, the UK, Jordan, Chile and Indonesia and involves almost half of its properties.  The firm is offering one year's free protection to people who used their cards in one of the compromised hotels.  The infection took place between August and December last year.  The Chicago-based Hyatt group has 627 properties in its portfolio. It said the 318 hotels it manages directly had been infected.  In a statement, Hyatt's global president of operations Chuck Floyd said that "unauthorised access" to payment card information - including the names of cardholders, card numbers and expiry dates - had been detected primarily in restaurants but also at spas, golf shops, parking and some front desks inside the hotel chain.  "We encourage you to remain vigilant and to review your payment card account statements closely," he said, adding that cards could now be used "with confidence" inside the hotel chain following the investigation.  Although he said the company had "worked quickly" with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to address the issue, the infection appeared to have gone unnoticed for about four months.  The period of risk for affected customers was between 30 July and 8 December 2015, Mr Floyd wrote.  Hyatt has now teamed up with a company called CSID, which specialises in identity protection and "fraud restoration" services, to offer one year's free coverage for those whose cards may have been compromised.  Security expert Brian Krebs noted on his blog that the Hilton, Starwood, Mandarin Oriental, White Lodging and the Trump Collection hotels were all hit by payment information breaches last year.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35321767	Missing benefits claimants 'risk destitution'	More than a million benefits claimants may be facing destitution after disappearing from the welfare system, Labour ex-minister Frank Field claims.  Sanctions are being applied "at a scale unknown since the Second World War" and the fate of at least a third of those hit "is anybody's guess", he said.  He says a government survey is needed to track the whereabouts of those dropping off the roll.  But the Department of Work and Pensions says the claims have "no basis".  About 1.5 million people leave the welfare system each year, but it is unclear how many are left without work or benefit payments, according to Mr Field, who chairs the influential Commons Work and Pensions select committee.  Some may be in jail or have moved abroad, while others are people on benefits who have been hit by sanctions and dropped out of the system, a report co-authored by Mr Field and Andrew Forsey, head of the MP's parliamentary office, found.  Sanctions are imposed when claimants fail to comply with welfare conditions imposed by the government.  The report, published by think tank Civitas, calls for ministers to carry out an urgent survey to find out what happens to claimants expelled from the welfare rolls who appear not to find work.  It welcomes plans to trial a "yellow card" early warning system for claimants facing sanction because they are deemed not to have done enough to find work - and calls for Jobcentre Plus staff to be given powers to issue non-financial sanctions.  It also recommends the Department for Work and Pensions trials a "grace period" for vulnerable claimants that eases the rules at times when they are facing transition or acute difficulty.  Mr Field and Mr Forsey said: "The number of sanctions was halved in the year leading up to the 2015 election, but it still remained at half a million.  "Sanctions are therefore being applied at a scale unknown since the Second World War, and the operation of sanctions on this scale makes for a most significant change in the social security system as it has existed in the post-war period.  "A number of people - we know not how large a number - are being totally disconnected from both work and welfare, and risk being exposed to destitution.  "Justice calls for a major survey of what happens to the hundreds of thousands of people thrown off the welfare rolls each year through the sanctioning process.  "It is unacceptable, not only for this government, but for its predecessor and those who will follow, to take away benefit from a mass of people each year and not trouble themselves with how this army of people survive.  "For that is what is happening under the government's sanctions policy. The ability to track the well-being of the whole population is now a part of being a grown up government, let alone a 'One Nation' government."  But a Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "There is no basis to these claims.  "People leave the benefits system for many reasons, including when they go to work - which is good news.  "It's extremely unlikely anyone would leave the benefit system because of a sanction. The truth is we have record employment and we spend £80bn supporting millions of people who are unemployed or on low incomes."  In 1997, Prime Minister Tony Blair gave Mr Field the task of "thinking the unthinkable" as a welfare reform minister, but he later resigned from government.  Following the 2010 general election, he led an independent review into UK poverty for the coalition government.  Last year Mr Field co-chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Hunger in the UK.	politics

Due to licensing agreements, Netflix content varies between countries - many users have a virtual private network (VPN) or other proxy to get round this.  The firm said it would increase efforts in the next few weeks to block the use of such proxies.  Netflix expanded streaming services to more than 130 countries last week.  But some countries have more content than others - for example, the Australian Netflix catalogue has only about 10% of the content available to its US subscribers.  David Fullagar, vice president of content delivery architecture, said in a blog post on Thursday that the US firm was in the process of licensing content around the world.  But he said it had a long way to go before it could offer viewers the same films and shows everywhere.  "If all of our content were globally available, there wouldn't be a reason for members to use proxies or 'unblockers' to fool our systems into thinking they're in a different country than they're actually in," he said.  "In the meantime, we will continue to respect and enforce content licensing by geographic location."  Subscribers that currently use proxies to view content outside their countries will only be able to access the service their countries in the coming week, the company said.  Those members that do not use VPNs will not be impacted by the crackdown, it added.  The move is a reversal of Netflix's denial last week after reports had surfaced that they would be restricting VPN access to their content.	tech

A series of groups spoke out after Europe's top court ruled a Romanian man whose employer read his messages had not had his rights violated.  He broke company policy by using a work account to talk to his family.  In response, bodies representing directors and workers, as well as privacy and human resources groups, all issued similar warnings to bosses.  The European Trades Union Congress, which represents workers across the continent, said the judges' decision should not act as a "green light… to start snooping" on staff.  The case in the European Court of Human Rights did not introduce any new rules, but acted as a stress test for those that already allowed similar surveillance by employers in some circumstances.  Institute of Directors director general Simon Walker said: "Employees should not be subject to Stasi-style surveillance at work.  "We would strongly urge businesses not to read an employee's personal messages, apart from in the most exceptional circumstances."  British Trades Union Congress general secretary Frances O'Grady said: "Big Brother bosses do not get the best out of employees.  "Staff who are being snooped on are less productive and less healthy".  And the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development said: "Employees that feel under excessive surveillance are also more likely to suffer from stress, so there needs to be a clear case for monitoring."  They were joined by the privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch, which said: "None of us should ever assume that what we do online during work hours or when using devices owned by our employer, such as computers, tablets or mobile phones, is private - but, equally, no employee should be in fear of being monitored by their boss."  The judges' ruling, handed down on Tuesday, said Romania had not failed to uphold the right to a private life of its citizen Bogdan Barbulescu.  Mr Barbulescu's employer had sacked him after finding he had been using a Yahoo Messenger account to speak to both his fiancee and his brother, despite having been asked to set up the account for work purposes only, the seven judges said.  The company had also banned private use of the internet at work.  When confronted, Mr Barbulescu had denied violating the policy, the judges found.  And the company had therefore been justified in reading both the work and private correspondence on the account - some of it highly sensitive.  Mr Barbulescu said his rights had been violated and, having been unsuccessful in arguing as much in the domestic courts, asked the judges to rule that Romania had failed in its duty to him.  The court's decision does not introduce new measures.  Reading the messages was already legal in Romania, as it is in other countries, including the UK.  Rather, it agreed with the Romanian authorities that the circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu's messages had been read did not represent a breach of his right to a private life.  The judges, in effect, declined to send a signal to courts across Europe that they considered surveillance under those circumstances unacceptable.  If the judges had found the other way, the Romanian government would have been obliged to abide by their decision.  Others, however, would not, because European Court of Human Rights decisions affect only the country named in the case.  The effect on domestic courts is different.  Each country adopts its own approach to the court's decisions.  In the UK, for example, judges are obliged to take them into account, not to follow them without question, as has sometimes been claimed.  Moreover, the court's decision did not actually go further than existing UK laws, which already allowed some reading of employees' communications under certain circumstances.  One of the seven judges, who disagreed with his colleagues, did say that the blanket ban on private internet use at work imposed by Mr Barbulescu's former employer was unacceptable and there should be stricter regulation of when and how bosses should be allowed to carry out such surveillance.  The case before the court considered the specific circumstances in which Mr Barbulescu found himself - rather than workplace surveillance as a whole - and agreed that they were not a breach of his rights.  So, avoiding those would be a good start.  In the UK, the amount of access employers have to employees' communications is defined by a series of laws and regulations that balance when it is lawful against when it is proportionate and necessary.  Essex University professor of EU and human rights law Steve Peers told the BBC: "Employees might be violating employer policies if they install software to block tracking.  "It is best for people to stick to company policy on use of work equipment and use their own smartphones if they need to do something personal.  "Definitely the wisest course for people whose company policies allow their work emails to be read - or who believe their employer would do it anyway - is to use their own phone or tablet, and use mobile data if they can, instead of employer wi-fi."  Apps that use end-to-end encryption, such as Signal, WhatsApp and others, provide an extra level of security.  Broadly, "the legal principles should be similar across Europe, particularly regarding personal data, as this is derived from EU legislation", said Kathryn Dooks, an employment partner at the law firm Kemp Little.  But some domestic laws and regulations would differ, she told the BBC.  The banking regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, requires banking companies to "take reasonable steps to record relevant telephone conversations, and keep a copy of relevant electronic communications" on company equipment.  FCA-regulated businesses must also take steps to stop staff sending work messages on their own equipment.  According to a 2014 Financial Times article, some banks became so concerned employees, aware they were being watched, would move to non-work channels to engage in illicit behaviour that they started comparing performance against average internal communications channel use.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35314824	Captain Kirk actor William Shatner backs Commons space debate	Star Trek actor William Shatner endorsed a House of Commons debate by MPs on space exploration.  The actor, who played Captain Kirk in the science fiction series, wrote a message of support for the discussion.  SNP MP Phillippa Whitford read out the message from Mr Shatner at the start of the debate.  Mr Shatner was quoted as saying: "Space is one of the last known frontiers, mostly untouched by mankind in his politics."  "In opening a debate on this subject, it is is my hope that you take the tenets of Star Trek's prime directive to universally and peacefully share in the exploration of it. I wish you all a wonderful debate. My best, Bill."  The debate also received a message of support on Twitter from another Star Trek actor, George Takei, who played USS Enterprise helmsman Sulu.  Ms Whitford told the Commons the space industry was "a real industry, a multi-billion pound industry". She called on ministers "to boldly go where no minister has gone before". She believed in the past the UK had shied away saying "space is for other people, the big boys - Russia, China, US but not us".  Ms Whitford also remarked that British astronaut Tim Peake was not the first British astronaut to go to space, that honour had already gone to Helen Sharman who went to space in 1991.  The debate came just one day ahead of Tim Peake's space walk and in response to the government publishing their national space policy. The policy set out the UK's aims to become "the European hub for commercial spaceflight and related space sector technologies" in order to create new jobs, businesses and a better understanding of space. Most MPs who attended were SNP members, with few MPs from others parties taking part.  The MPs debated where a spaceport could be based in the UK, with Cornwall, and areas of Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales all coming out as contenders.  Alan Brown, MP for Kilmarnock and Loudoun, elicited calls of "shame" from other MPs after admitting he had not watched the early Star Wars movies. He said in the past he had objected to spending money on vanity projects rather than working to improve social justice but believed a thriving space industry could bring significant benefits to the UK population.  Carol Monaghan, MP for Glasgow North West, said she had been asked if the debate was "really that important". She said she believed it was "crucial" as the space and defence industries were the only ones that really pushed innovation, producing spin off technologies and products such as prosthetic limbs, foam mattresses and artificial satellites.  Yvonne Fovargue, shadow business, innovation and skills minister, welcomed the debate but criticised the "ad hoc" nature of government funding which she said hindered strategic planning. She highlighted how space industry research had brought benefits to disaster relief, medicine and transport.  The debate ended with Business Minister George Freeman calling the UK space sector "an undoubted and massive success story". He said the government's national space policy demonstrated a long term commitment to the industry, but he said he wouldn't "pre-empt" the process of selecting a spaceport adding it would be done "fairly" and "openly".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35313090	Labour's general election defeat verdict revealed	Labour's general election policies were not too left wing, an internal report into why the party lost says.  There are claims the report, which was completed in November, has been suppressed by the party because it would undermine Jeremy Corbyn.  But the BBC's Iain Watson, who has been briefed on its contents, says it does not blame "left wing" policies.  He said the party was likely to publish the report, which was written by Margaret Beckett, on Tuesday.  More than 500 people have signed a petition calling for it to be released.  Commissioning the report last May, interim Labour leader Harriet Harman said the party needed a "forensic, honest examination of where it went wrong" in order to regain the trust of the British public.  It will be discussed by a sub committee of Labour's National Executive next week.  In the meantime, I have spoken to a senior Labour source who has seen the report and I have - verbatim - its key findings.  The report sets out four reasons why the party lost the election, gleaned from polling and doorstep conversations:  The report reads like it is written by committee - the left are likely to point to some of its finding a as a kind of endorsement, mainstream MPs will highlight others  The report provides some solace for Corbynistas.  It says: "Some of the 'left-wing policies' were the most popular" (eg mansions tax) and "individual policies polled well - the issue was the lack of a consistent, cohesive narrative".  It also says some voters on the left wouldn't have voted for Labour if it had been any more right wing  But - on the other hand - it says the party failed to win sufficient votes from the Lib Dems in the right parts of the country, and did better in seats which Labour already held, and "we failed to connect with demographic groups who are seen as in the centre" of British politics.  Beckett's report more or less absolves the party officials who undertook the "ground war" in the run up to May's general election but suggests the party targeted too many seats - 106. The Conservatives attacked in only 50 and defended a further 50. Labour devoted few resources to seats where it was vulnerable.  Less spin, and getting the shadow cabinet to hold meetings outside London are among the recommendations, as well as identifying the need to have a "simple seamless narrative".  But Jeremy Corbyn might some of the report harder to swallow - it calls for a stronger defence of Labour's record in government - ie New Labour's record ("we should be proud of our record of major social change") and that the party should point out how "it paid down debt" before the financial crash.  And it says "we must take the global crash myth head on which dogged us through the last Parliament".  The report also suggests working more closely with business and gives some credence to the criticism that the party wasn't seen as being sufficiently in favour of individual aspiration.  A Labour spokesman said: "The formal process of considering the Learning the Lessons report is in its final stages and will conclude next week when it is presented to the relevant committee of the NEC. The Labour Party will then make the report public."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35306209	AirMule military drone set to dodge trees in tests	The maker of a drone designed to carry loads of up to 500kg (1,100lb) says it plans to see if it can fly itself between trees and other obstacles before the end of the year.  The Israeli company behind the AirMule has already successfully tested it flying itself without being tethered to the ground for safety reasons.  It aims to be able to deliver models to military customers in the next decade.  One expert said the drone was impressive but raised safety concerns.  Urban Aeronautics has received financial support from the Israeli government for the project, and its chief executive said it could help save lives.  "[It could fly to] anyone out in the field who needs water, food, batteries, supplies, medical equipment and so forth," Rafi Yoeli told the BBC.  "Later, it could be used to fetch soldiers that you don't want to leave behind or are wounded.  "There are plenty of situations where you cannot send a helicopter - for example, in the middle of fighting where you want to evacuate people from a street or from a narrow roof.  "Eventually, there could be civilian applications, such as rescue missions in the mountains or flying into disaster areas - for example, nuclear facilities where no person in a helicopter could get in."  Urban Aeronautics has carried out nearly 200 test flights of the AirMule, including its first untethered trial at the Megiddo airfield in northern Israel on 30 December.  The machine, 6.2m (20ft) long and 2.3m (7.5ft) tall, takes off vertically, like a helicopter.  The company aims to make it able to fly at a maximum speed of 180km/h (112mph) and as high as 18,000ft (5,500m) once a more powerful turboshaft engine is fitted.  Mr Yoeli said his team also needed to upgrade the aircraft's flight control system to make it capable of flying in rain and other bad weather.  In addition, he said, further work had to be done before he could say what lifespan it would have.  "When you supply a vehicle to the customer, you need to offer them a guarantee that it will work for 500 hours or 1,000 hours or so many take-offs and landings," he said.  "So, we need to develop the knowledge of the lifespan of the components and maybe redesign some of them.  "This will be an expensive aircraft.  "There is nothing out there that has the dimensions of a Humvee [military vehicle] yet can take off vertically with 500kg of supplies and fly for an hour."  Before the end of 2016, he added, the plan was to demonstrate it could fly itself at low heights over obstructed terrain without the risk of a collision and to carry out the first robotic delivery of a parcel at a destination.  A drone expert from Imperial College London said the aircraft could prove groundbreaking, but the engineers would have to prove it did not pose a threat to other aircraft or people living under its flight path.  "The vehicle design and control system is impressive," said Dr Ravi Vaidyanathan.  "Evacuation of injured people, delivery of supplies or equipment, and intelligence support could represent the first use of autonomous systems in defence and humanitarian relief operations.

She said elections in May would be a "big first test" for the party as they face the London mayoral, Scottish, Welsh and English local elections.  The party had "turned left", she said, away from a centre-left position which she said had been "most effective".  Her comments come as Labour's membership has reportedly soared.  Baroness Jowell, a former minister in both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's governments, told BBC London's Vanessa Feltz radio show that Jeremy Corbyn "carried a tide" with an "extraordinary level" of "enthusiastic support" from hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members.  However, she questioned whether ordinary people, not part of the party, would vote for its policies, she said: "Is its offer, policy offer, one which people who are not members of the Labour Party want to vote for because they feel it will meet their needs?"  She said: "Will the Jeremy Corbyn Labour Party actually become a party of government?"  "You can have a party which is a movement which satisfies its members, enthuses its members and engages its members, but the role of a great political party like the Labour Party is to become a party of government," she said.  Asked whether she thought the Labour Party could become a party of government she replied "I don't know yet, we're four years away" from the general election.  She said elections in May would be "the moment at which the new Labour Party is tested".  During Labour's London mayoral candidate contest she ran against Sadiq Khan, who won.  She said she "gave it everything I could" and "couldn't have fought a better campaign" adding "I didn't win because the Labour Party turned left".  The Labour Party has released its membership numbers which show increases linked to the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader.	politics

Some of those affected took to Nest's own forum and social media to vent their anger about the problem.  Nest said that it was aware of the issue and that it had been fixed for "99.5%" of users.  It recommended that, for those still experiencing problems "performing a manual reset should help". It also published a nine-step fix.  "We are aware of a software bug impacting some Nest Thermostat owners. In some cases, this may cause the device to respond slowly or become unresponsive. We are working on a solution that we expect to roll out in the coming weeks," it said in a statement.  It did not say how many users had been affected.  The issue appears to have been traced to a software update in December - with problems not emerging until early January.  The bug drained the battery life of thermostats and deactivated the system.  Others reported that the thermostat was unexpectedly heating up their house.  The £200 Nest thermostat has been designed to learn the right temperatures for a home at any given time, potentially saving money on heating bills. Nest also offers a smoke alarm and security camera to allow users to keep an eye on their home via a smartphone.  The firm was bought by Google for $3.2 bn (£2.2 bn) two years ago.  Martin Usborne, a photographer from London, told the BBC he had experienced problems with his Nest thermostat earlier this month.  "It broke down twice. I got an error message saying it was not connected. The house was very cold and I had to reboot it," he said.  "I have a love/hate relationship with Nest. Since it was installed, the house is warmer but my heating bill has gone up by 60% so it doesn't seem to be doing its job in saving money," he added.  A spokesman for Nest said he could not comment on Mr Usborne's specific case without speaking to him directly.  Ovum analyst Rik Turner said that the issue was likely to be repeated in other smart devices.  "As we increasingly put distance between humans and their devices so we will increasingly become hostages to fortune," he said.  "In the past you might have been able to fix hardware or get a bloke round who could but now it requires a patch from the manufacturer."  The trend to connect more and more devices to the internet of things is gathering pace as the cost of connecting physical things to the network continues to fall.  Analyst firm Gartner predicts that 6.4 billion connected things will be in use in 2016 but it warns that the costs of making sure such systems were secure would also rise.  There have already been cases of hackers remotely taking control of internet-connected cars.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35301148	Private messages at work can be read by European employers	Employers can read workers' private messages sent via chat software and webmail accounts during working hours, judges have ruled.  The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said a firm that read a worker's Yahoo Messenger chats sent while he was at work was within its rights.  Judges said he had breached the company's rules and that his employer had a right to check on his activities.  Such policies must also protect workers against unfettered snooping, they said.  The judges, sitting in the ECHR in Strasbourg, handed down their decision on Tuesday. Countries that have ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, which include Britain, have agreed to abide by the ECHR rulings that involve them.  The impact on domestic courts differs. Under UK human rights laws, judges must take into account the ECHR's decisions but are not bound by them.  The worker, an engineer in Romania, had hoped the court would rule that his employer had breached his right to confidential correspondence when it accessed his messages and subsequently sacked him in 2007.  His employer had discovered that he was using Yahoo Messenger for personal contacts, as well as professional ones.  Because it believed it was accessing a work account, the judges said, the firm had not erred.  They dismissed the man's request, saying that it was not "unreasonable that an employer would want to verify that employees were completing their professional tasks during working hours".  The judges said: "The employer acted within its disciplinary powers since, as the domestic courts found, it had accessed the Yahoo Messenger account on the assumption that the information in question had been related to professional activities and that such access had therefore been legitimate. The court sees no reason to question these findings."  The man, named Bogdan Barbulescu, had already lost his case in Romania's domestic courts and appealed to the ECHR.  He argued that his right to a private life had been breached when his employer had read a log of messages on a Yahoo Messenger account he had set up for work, as well as that from a second personal one.  Mr Barbulescu's employer had banned its staff from sending personal messages at work.  To check his account, the judges said, it had been necessary for his employer to access his records.  The judges said this was a proportionate step because the firm did not access other information stored on his work computer.  And they added that Mr Barbulescu had had prior warning that the company could check his messages.  Despite claims about the second, personal account, the judges only discussed the work account in their ruling.  The device used to send the messages was owned by the employer, and the judges did not elaborate on whether it would have made any difference if he had used a personal device.  One of the eight judges disagreed with the decision, saying that a blanket ban on personal internet use was unacceptable.  Going forward, he added, all employers should clearly explain any rules that would allow them to check on their workers' online activities.  "All employees should be notified personally of the said policy and consent to it explicitly," he wrote.  Lilian Edwards, a professor of internet law at Strathclyde University, said the judgment was in line with UK law and past cases.  "In this case, the employers say clearly that you are not to use the internet for anything but work.  "Although it is not popular, it is completely legal.  "The employer seems to have played this by the book.  She added that blanket bans on personal internet use at work were unreasonable because people retained the right to their own private life even while working.  That was particularly important, she said, as people worked longer hours.  Sally Annereau, a data protection analyst at the law firm Taylor Wessing, said that UK law allowed proportionate checks on employees' communications.  "This judgment underlines the importance of having appropriate and lawful employee-monitoring policies in place and making sure both that they are communicated to employees and that they are adhered to by the employer," she said.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35308129	'Not enough Tories' in general election opinion polls	The failure of opinion pollsters to predict the outcome of May's general election may have been because Conservative voters are harder to track down, a report suggests.  The disparity between forecasts and the eventual Conservative majority has been blamed on "shy Tory" voters or a late swing to David Cameron's party.  His report said "more time and effort" was needed to find Conservative voters.  Pre-election polls had suggested the result was too close to call, but the Conservatives went on to win an absolute majority, with 331 seats.  Prof Curtice, who wrote the report for research agency NatCen, suggested polling difficulties arose "primarily because [pollsters] interviewed too many Labour supporters and not enough Conservatives".  NatCen interviewed 4,238 people between July and November last year for its British Social Attitudes Survey.  It said it had made "repeated efforts" over the four months to make contact with the people it had selected to interview - and among those it was able to contact most easily, Labour had a six-point lead.  However, among the harder-to-contact group, who took between three and six calls to track down, the Conservatives were 11 points ahead.  "Polls are conducted over just two or three days, which means they are more likely to interview those who are contacted most easily, either over the internet or via their phone," the report said.  The report rejected the "shy Tories" argument, which suggests Conservatives are less willing to declare their voting intentions when asked.  It said even when polling companies returned to respondents and asked how they had voted, they still put Labour and the Tories neck and neck.  But the British Social Attitudes survey put the Conservatives 6.1 points ahead of Labour, close to the actual election margin of 6.6 points.  Polling companies use a complex method to attempt to make their surveys representative, including weighting the responses to match the UK's demographic profile.  The report said its random sampling method was more representative.  Prof Curtice added: "A key lesson of the difficulties faced by the polls in the 2015 general election is that surveys not only need to ask the right questions but also the right people."  An investigation by the British Polling Council into the polling failures ahead of May's general election is due to be published later this month.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35306094	Labour: Lords curbs 'stifle debate'	Labour has accused the government of trying to "stifle debate" by removing peers' power to veto some draft laws.  Shadow Lords leader Baroness Smith said the move was a "massive over-reaction" to the government's defeat over tax credit changes last year.  She was speaking as peers debated the proposals put forward by Conservative Lord Strathclyde.  The Tory peer said Lords were actually being given a new "very practical" power they had never had before.  He led a review launched by David Cameron into the powers of the House of Lords after they blocked plans to cut tax credits in October, to the anger of Conservative ministers.  The cuts were later shelved in the Autumn Statement.  The review recommended taking away the absolute veto the House of Lords had over laws, called statutory instruments, and instead create a new procedure allowing them to send the secondary legislation back to the House of Commons to "think again".  They would only be allowed to do this once, enabling the House of Commons to have the final say and push through its agenda even if the Lords disagrees.  Lord Strathclyde told a packed Upper House this new procedure would be the "ping without the pong" referring to legislation that goes back and forth between the House of Commons and Lords until both agree, commonly known as ping-ponging.  But Baroness Smith said it was "an unnecessary solution to a fictitious problem".  "The reality is that we seldom use our powers to their limits," she said.  "But that doesn't mean they shouldn't exist."  Unlike in the Commons, the Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Lords.  Making his maiden speech in the House of Lords, former Labour chancellor Alistair Darling said he understood the frustration of being a government minister.  George Osborne should have been grateful to peers for bringing about the reversal, he said, recalling the former Labour government's much-criticised abolition of the 10p rate of income tax.  He said the tax credit changes should have been introduced as primary legislation in the first place, which would have allowed the Lords to scrutinise them.  "I am increasingly concerned about the amount of constitutional change taking place in this country on a piecemeal basis," he added.  In recent years, Lord Strathclyde said the House of Lords had developed a "lesser understanding of the implications of what happens when we use our powers too aggressively" and enjoyed "unfettered powers" to veto secondary legislation.  Under the proposed model, he said: "We have a conversation between the two Houses but they (the Commons) have the final say."  It was right for the Lords to have a new procedure "to do what we do best, which is to ask the Commons to think again", he added.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35300671	Theresa May refuses to say whether UK spies access medical data	Theresa May has refused to say whether Britain's security services are accessing medical records and other potentially sensitive information.  The home secretary said she did not want to "go down the route of giving information about the sort of data sets that are being acquired".  She was speaking to the draft Investigatory Powers Bill committee.  It was revealed last year that GCHQ is downloading large amounts of personal data to aid its investigations.  It could include the personal details of "a large number of individuals, the majority of whom will not be of any interest to the security and intelligence agencies", according the draft bill.  The information from these "bulk personal data sets," which could include everything from the electoral register, supermarket loyalty schemes or bank records, is then analysed to enable investigators to "join the dots".  The practice is covered by old legislation and has never been debated by MPs.  Theresa May is promising new safeguards over the use of the powers, including six-month warrants to access data, and judicial oversight.  She said the security minister, John Hayes, had written to the committee of MPs and peers scrutinising the draft bill= to give the reasons why the government did not want to reveal the kinds of data investigators were accessing.  She insisted the practice - and the sweeping up by the security services of large quantities of internet traffic passing through the UK - did not amount to "mass surveillance" as civil liberties campaigners claim.  "The UK does not undertake mass surveillance," she told the committee.  The government's anti-terror legislation watchdog David Anderson is set to warn in a report that Ms May needs to come out and make the case to MPs and the public for the bulk collection of data.  If the government does not do this, it risks the practice being outlawed by the European Court of Justice, he is set to warn.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35300668	Prime Minister's Questions: Cameron and Corbyn housing clash	David Cameron is under pressure to guarantee "sink estate" residents can return to their old communities after they have been bulldozed.  Mr Cameron this week announced plans to regenerate 100 estates with some to be demolished.  But at PMQs Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said council tenants and Right-to-Buy purchasers would be "forced away".  The PM called Mr Corbyn a "small-c conservative" who wanted people to stay "stuck" in council estates.  The Labour leader said Mr Cameron had not "thought this thing through very carefully", pointing out that the estates bulldozed would include people who had bought their homes under the Conservatives' flagship Right-to-Buy policy.  He asked: "Will those people, the leaseholders, will they be guaranteed homes on those rebuilt estates that you are proposing to do?"  The PM said local councils and residents would be involved in the process which would "make sure that tenants get good homes, make sure homeowners get rehoused in new houses".  Pressed afterwards about the demolition plans on the BBC's Daily Politics, Conservative security minister John Hayes said the details of the redevelopment policy had not been announced but he was confident people would be offered "decent" alternative accommodation while construction work was taking place.  The leaders' clash came as the government's Housing Bill makes its way through Parliament. The legislation offers the Right-to-Buy for housing association tenants and also covers so-called "starter homes" which are aimed at first-time buyers.  Mr Corbyn said these homes would be unaffordable to people on the new National Living Wages living in 98% of council areas.  Rather than building more affordable homes, the government was "branding more homes as affordable", he added.  Mr Cameron said he and the Labour leader both owned their own homes, asking: "Why won't we let those 1.3 million (housing association tenants) own their homes?"  With his questions, Angus Robertson, the SNP's Westminster leader, called for the return of a post-study work visa for foreign students, saying business and colleges in Scotland supported the move.  The PM said such a visa would effectively tell foreign students "it's okay to stay with a less than graduate job".  He told MPs: "We don't need the world's brightest and best to come here to study and then to do menial labour jobs, which actually that's not what our immigration system is for."  Jeremy Corbyn stuck to one broad subject - housing - for each of his allocated questions, surprising pundits by avoiding the junior doctors' strike.  He introduced two members of the public - Daryl on whether tenants would be offered replacement housing in the same areas, and Linda, who was worried about her tenancy if she downsizes when she gets older.  The atmosphere in the Commons was noticeably rowdier than some of the Labour leader's early appearances, when Mr Corbyn called for a different approach reflecting his "new politics".  The prime minister managed a dig about Labour's drawn-out reshuffle, which he said was "still going on", and rounded off his answers by claiming Mr Corbyn "does not believe in Britain".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35303997	Hacker hits US spy chief James Clapper's personal accounts	The US director of national intelligence has had several of his personal online accounts hacked, his office has confirmed.  A spokesman said the matter had been "reported to the appropriate authorities", but declined to say more.  As director of national intelligence, James Clapper serves as a key adviser to the US president on security matters including cyberthreats.  It follows a similar cyber-attack on the CIA's director in October.  The Motherboard news site reported on Tuesday that it had been contacted by a young hacker who had claimed responsibility.  Motherboard reported the teenager had said he was part of the same group - Crackas With Attitude (CWA) - behind the earlier breach.  The youth said he had broken into Mr Clapper's personal email, his Verizon phone and internet account settings and a Yahoo email account belonging to Mr Clapper's wife.  The BBC understands that Mr Clapper's office has only seen evidence that the hacker actually accessed Sue Clapper's email and the couple's family phone number.  It appears that the teenager altered the phone number's settings so that calls were rerouted to a spokesman for the Free Palestine Movement, a cause the CWA says it supports.  Motherboard said the hacker had also passed on what he claimed was a log of home calls Mr Clapper had recently made and received.  Security blogger Graham Cluley said it was odd that no screenshots of Mr Clapper's emails had been shared if his account had indeed been breached, but added that the other evidence was still concerning.  "If the details of the security breach are true then it is obviously a concern that the hacker was not only able to reroute calls made to Clapper's home, but also view the phone numbers of people calling him and access personal email accounts," he wrote.  "For that reason, it's perhaps a relief that those behind the hack were more interested in simply pranking the director of national intelligence rather than having something more menacing in mind."	tech

The disclosure follows a local regulator's demand for the information.  Six other car tech companies also revealed data about autonomous-driving safety incidents of their own.  Google wants to build cars without manual controls, but California-based Consumer Watchdog now says the company's own data undermines its case.  Privacy project director John Simpson asked: "How can Google propose a car with no steering wheel, brakes or driver?  "Release of the disengagement report was a positive step, but Google should also make public any video it has of the disengagement incidents, as well as any technical data it collected, so we can fully understand what went wrong as it uses our public roads as its private laboratory."  The 32-page report says during 15 months of tests of California's public roads:  It adds: "These events are rare and our engineers carefully study these simulated contacts and refine the software to ensure the self-driving car performs safely.  "We are generally driving more autonomous miles between these events.  "From April 2015 to November 2015, our cars self-drove more than 230,000 miles without a single such event."  Most of the other companies to file "vehicle disengagement reports" with the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) provided less detail:  Towards the end of last year, California's DMV published draft proposals that fully licensed drivers would have to be behind the wheels and pedals of autonomous cars sold to the public.  But John Krafcik, the newly appointed president of Google's self-driving car project, said earlier this week that allowing humans to intervene could actually make a crash more likely.  The car "has to shoulder the whole burden", he said at the Detroit Auto Show.  But Mr Krafcik said Google's plans would be influenced by car manufacturers.  "No-one goes this alone," he said.  "We are going to be partnering more and more and more."  One expert said it could be decades before regulators allowed vehicles be built without manual controls.  "For a long period, you will see autonomous vehicles and human-driven cars share the road," said Prof David Bailey, from the Aston Business School, in Birmingham.  "That makes the situation more complicated, which makes a strong argument for letting people be able to take back control.  "From the point of view of people's acceptance and confidence in the technology, that will be needed anyway."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35301298	Ruth Davidson: The 'tough old bird' of Tory Scotland	In May, Scotland goes to the polls to elect the Scottish Parliament. Could this be the moment for a Tory resurgence? John Sweeney met Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson for BBC Newsnight.  She is Tory, openly gay, Christian, likes a drink and, as a kick-boxer and ex-squaddie, can kill you. What's not to like? In the flesh, Ruth Davidson, 37, is a firkin of fun, speaks with a machine-gun delivery and can hold her own. And then some.  On the top of a knobbly hill across the way from Arthur's Seat, overlooking Holyrood in Edinburgh, I put to her my killer line: "If this was a Scottish gangster movie, you'd be wearing concrete boots."  "I'm not entirely sure what gangster movies you watch," she says. "But I think it's fair to say that the Scottish Conservatives have underperformed in recent years - particularly at that critical juncture in 1997. We got a lot of things wrong. We just had a wipeout."  As she spoke, Davidson gave me a sunny, easygoing smile with a hint of steel. Davidson needs to be uber-tough because bare knuckles and Scottish politics go together like horse and carriage.  Here, the simple fact of which nation we're in is disputed - and the polls suggest that Davidson, as a committed Unionist, could be on tricky ground. The Tories are hovering around 15%, behind Labour - and very far behind the Scottish National Party which is currently tipped, come May, to bag one in two votes.  Scottish political analyst David Torrance suggests that hard political fact is unlikely to change any time soon. He postulates that politics north of the border is "historically hegemonic". In the 19th Century, Scotland was broadly Liberal; in the 20th, Labour; in the 21st; Scottish Nationalist.  But the Tories used to do well in whole swathes of Scotland. They now repeatedly come third or fourth. One reason, according to some analysts, is the legacy of the hated poll tax and its architect, Mrs Thatcher - the great she-devil of Scottish nationalism. Did Davidson get bored with defending Mrs T?  "To be honest, that's not been the topic of conversation in Scotland for quite some time - we've had other things on our plate," she says.  "I was was six months old when Margaret Thatcher came to power. I was in primary school when she left office - so it's not really something for my generation or the generations that come after me."  "I'm 37. You can vote now in Scotland at the age of 16 - so talk about Margaret Thatcher is the same as talking about Gladstone or Disraeli in terms of the distance that's there."  Seeking a weakness, I probed further: "Your mum and dad, they lived in a castle?" She snorted with derision. Her parents were working-class Tories and she was brought up in a housing estate.  You get the drift that she's as vulnerable as a claymore, and sharp with it too. I geo-name-dropped that I'd been to Chechnya: quick as a flash she was chatting about its neighbours, Dagestan and Ingushetia. Her interest in abroad was galvanised by her time as a signaller in the Territorial Army. She served for a bit in Kosovo and was moved by what she saw.  The one thing that got her goat, which she didn't block with her customary good humour, was homophobia.  "I do call out and will challenge or retweet or draw attention to it when people make homophobic remarks about me, because I've got a lot of young followers on Twitter, and I think they have to see that it is OK to say, 'That's not acceptable language. I do not have to accept this.'  "It's important in their lives, rather than a tough old bird like me."  In Davidson, the Tories have, cleverly or not, picked someone similar in appearance and brutal good humour to the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon. Davidson, too, has - like the late Denis Healey and Boris Johnson - that most precious quality thing in politics: authenticity.  But the polls aren't shifting in her favour and you wonder just how grim things would be for the Scottish Tories if she wasn't at the helm.  John Sweeney was reporting for BBC Newsnight - watch his piece here. He also plans to profile Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35298707	Flooding: Environment Agency told to put homes before nature	The Environment Agency has been ordered to prioritise protecting people's homes ahead of nature when tackling flooding, the prime minister says.  David Cameron told a committee of MPs there had been an "attitudinal change" which he wanted to see continue.  He cited the example of the Somerset Levels, where dredging of rivers has resumed in a bid to avoid a repeat of flooding seen in 2013-14.  He also defended the response to floods in northern England and Scotland.  In an appearance before the Commons Liaison Committee, Mr Cameron said: "You've seen quite an attitudinal change in the Environment Agency that in years gone past, I think, were trying to balance up the effects on nature on the one hand and protecting property on the other hand.  "We've said to them: 'The time for that is over. This is about protecting human lives. This is about protecting our homes.'  "I want to see that continued shift. You saw that very directly in Somerset, where there is a man-made environment and it was ridiculous those rivers weren't being dredged.  I threatened to go and drive the dredger myself. Those rivers have now been dredged.  "Do we need an attitudinal change in the way we approach flooding? Yes, we absolutely do."  The Environment Agency, which covers England, is responsible for managing the risk of flooding from main rivers, and issues flood alerts and warnings.  But that was not the reason it was set up or the main part of its remit.  "We work to create better places for people and wildlife, and support sustainable development," the agency says on the "what we do" section of its website.  Several storms wreaked havoc across the UK in December, with Cumbria, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire among the worst affected by the floods.  Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland also saw flooding and damage from a series of storms, including Desmond, Eva and Frank.  The environment agency's chairman, Sir Philip Dilley, resigned on Monday after coming under pressure for holidaying in Barbados during the recent floods.  Last month the agency's deputy chief executive said a "complete rethink" of the UK's flood defences was required, saying better waterproofing of homes and improved warning systems were vital for tackling future weather extremes.  Mr Cameron told MPs more could be done, saying that "the country wants us to do more and we will do more".  The authorities need to get better at river management and more flood defences are needed, he said.	politics

About 71.9 million units were shipped in the period, which includes the key Christmas shopping season.  IDC said the decline was the worst since it started tracking PC shipments.  PC demand has been hit by competition from smartphones and tablets, along with longer lifecycles for PCs.  Shipments fell in all regions around the world and have declined for five quarters in a row, according to IDC's figures.  Rival research firm Gartner also said shipments were down. Using different methodology, it saw a fall of 8.3% in the fourth quarter from a year ago.  It doesn't take much analysis to work out why PC shipments are falling rapidly. I mean, look around you. If you're at home, what do you have in the corner where your PC used to go?  Then again, you're more likely to not be at home. The majority of visitors to this website, and most other major sites and networks, arrive their using their mobile devices.  And that leaves the workplace, the domain where PC is still king, and will remain so for a while yet.  Sales tanked in the last quarter, sure, but analysts expect the PC market to pick up again in 2016 as companies start to upgrade to Windows 10 which launched in the middle of last year.  Unlike home users, who could update in a few hours or so, big firms need to plan well ahead - and so many would have held off until the new year.  It'll mean a boost for traditional PC sales, but not a halt in their overall long-term decline.  Instead, IDC notes that sales of computers with detachable tablets, like Microsoft's Surface, are growing quickly (albeit from an almost standing start).  Other factors that contributed to the decline in shipments included economic issues such as falling commodity prices, weaker currencies, turmoil in financial markets driven by China, as well social tensions in the Middle East.  Apple was the only top five PC maker to see shipments grow last year, up over 6%, while Acer saw the biggest fall, of more more than 18%.  "Consumer sentiment toward PCs remains a challenge, though clearly there are pockets of growth," said IDC research manager Jay Chou in a statement.  "Even as mainstream desktop and notebooks see their lifetimes stretched ever longer, Apple's emergence as a top five global PC vendor in 2015 shows that there can be strong demand for innovative, even premium-priced systems that put user experience first."  Chinese tech giant Lenovo, however, remained at the top of the market - owning more than 20% of it. HP followed in second place, with Dell third and Apple and ASUS tied for the fourth spot.	tech

The runners were from New Balance and 3D Systems and are the world's first commercially available running shoe with a 3D-printed midsole.  The shoes are due to go on sale this April but the price has not yet been released.  More at BBC.com/Click and @BBCClick.	tech

Andrew Tyrie asked why military aspects of the operation were excluded from the probe carried out by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC).  The PM said the UK was currently engaged in a military operation and the ISC was set up to look at intelligence.  He also defended his claim of 70,000 "non-extremist" moderate Syria forces.  The bad tempered-exchanges with Mr Tyrie came as Mr Cameron was questioned on Syria by the Commons Liaison Committee.  In September, the PM announced that two British Islamic State jihadists, Cardiff-born Reyaad Khan and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen, had been killed by a UK drone strike in Syria.  MPs have since voted to authorise UK air strikes in the war-torn country.  Mr Tyrie, who chairs the committee, asked whether the investigation into the strike would be seen as "incomplete" or even "meaningless" if it could not include its military background.  The PM said he did "not agree with this for a moment".  MPs cannot oversee current military operations, he said, telling Mr Tyrie the UK was currently engaged in an operation against a terrorist group that intends to "blow up, kill and maim our citizens".  The strike was "necessary and proportionate", he added.  "That's what is going on," he said, adding that "if you don't think there is a cell of people sitting in a cell in Raqqa who are planning to try and do damage to this country then you don't know what you are talking about".  After the committee meeting, Mr Tyrie released a statement urging the prime minister to change his mind and allow a "proper inquiry".  "On the basis of today's evidence, the Intelligence and Security Committee will not be able to do a thorough job," he said.  Until the ISC can examine military aspects of the strike, he said, it will not be able to reassure Parliament and the public that the strikes were "necessary and proportionate".  Mr Cameron makes regular appearances before the Liaison Committee, which is made up of select committee chairmen.  He was grilled by defence committee chairman Julian Lewis on why he would not provide more details of the 70,000 troops he described as "non-extremist opposition fighters".  The figure had been provided by the Joint Intelligence Committee, he said, and he did not want to give Syrian President Assad a list of the groups he should be targeting.  They are not all "impeccable democrats", he said: "Some do belong to Islamist groups and some belong to relatively hardline Islamist groups."  The PM also said he was prepared to take another look at offers to take in Syrian refugees made by individuals including Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby and former Labour minister Yvette Cooper - after home affairs chairman Keith Vaz said they had been rejected as they had "not been cleared".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35295404	'English votes' rules used for first time in House of Commons	New "English votes for English laws" rules have been implemented in the House of Commons for the first time.  Conservative MPs cheered as English and Welsh members prepared to give their consent to parts of the Housing and Planning Bill that only apply to their constituencies.  Housing Minister Brandon Lewis said he was "very proud" to be implementing the reforms.  But the SNP said the changes were "driving Scotland out of the door".  They were introduced in response to calls for a stronger voice for English MPs following increased devolution to Scotland.  Where parts of a bill are deemed to only affect England, or England and Wales, a new stage is added to the usual law-making process at which only MPs for English - or English and Welsh - constituencies can vote.  Following the end of the Housing Bill's report stage, Speaker John Bercow suspended the sitting of the Commons for five minutes before finalising which provisions applied to which nations.  After MPs debated the new rules - SNP members were entitled to speak but not to vote - the "consent motion" for England and Wales was agreed without a division.  The Housing Bill, which includes an extension of the right-to-buy for housing association tenants in England, was later approved by all MPs at third reading stage.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35297464	Hackers caused power cut in western Ukraine	A power cut in western Ukraine last month was caused by a type of hacking known as "spear-phishing", says the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS).  The attack caused a blackout for 80,000 customers of western Ukraine's Prykarpattyaoblenergo utility.  Experts have described the incident as the first known power outage caused by a cyber attack.  Ukraine's state security service has attributed the attack to state-sponsored hackers from Russia.  DHS said the "BlackEnergy Malware" used in the attack appears to have infected Ukraine's systems via a corrupted Microsoft Word attachment.  The same code was detected in 2014 within systems at US facilities but there was no known successful disruption to the US grid.  There are lots of sophisticated ways that hackers can break into systems but often the most effective ones are the simplest. Spear-phishing is a highly targeted attack aimed at specific individuals or groups within an organisation and it works because it is trading on human curiosity and vulnerability - simply asking someone to open an email.  That email, once opened, will either contain an attachment or a link to a website - which may appear perfectly legitimate but will in fact contain malware.  Often the hacker may have personal information about the target to make the email more believable - it may refer to the target by name for example.  The malware allows the computer to be taken over remotely. The user may be none the wiser - often hackers provide a decoy document that will hide any malicious activity.  Crimea, the region annexed from Ukraine by Russia, has suffered repeated power cuts since Russia seized the territory in March last year. Russia has blamed pro-Ukraine saboteurs for the outages.  Independent analysts have linked the recent spear-phishing attack to Russia. iSight Partners, a US security firm, said the probable culprit was the so-called "Sandworm Team", a Russian hacking group it has been tracking for more than a year.  "We have linked Sandworm Team to the incident, principally based on BlackEnergy 3, the malware that has become their calling card," John Hultquist, director of cyber espionage analysis at iSight Partners, said in a blog post.  A report released by Washington-based SANS Inc over the weekend concluded hackers had probably caused Ukraine's six-hour outage by remotely switching breakers in a way that cut power  The attackers are also believed to have spammed the Ukrainian utility's customer-service centre with phone calls in order to prevent real customers from highlighting the issue.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35297536	DDoS extortion gang suspect arrested by European police	A suspected member of an online extortion gang has been arrested, police have said.  Officers said they believed they had apprehended a key member of the group DD4BC, while another suspect was also in custody after raids.  Forces from various European countries, including Scotland Yard detectives, worked together on the operation.  The group is accused of taking down companies' websites and demanding ransoms to stop.  Its name, which stands for Distributed Denial of Service for the online currency Bitcoin, is an apparent reference to its alleged tactics.  In September last year, a report from the net firm Akamai alleged that the group had carried out more than 140 attacks in the previous 10 months on banks, media groups and gaming firms.  Europol said that "key members of the organised network" were tracked to Bosnia-Herzegovina by officers from the Metropolitan Police, who were working with the European Union's law enforcement agency.  On 15 and 16 December, officers from Austria, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Germany, as well as those from the United Kingdom, worked together to carry out raids.  They were assisted on "Operation Pleiades" by their colleagues from Australia, France and Japan, as well as Romania, USA and Switzerland. The international agency Interpol also helped, Europol said.  In a statement released on Tuesday, it added that the operation "resulted in the arrest of a main target and one more suspect detained. Multiple property searches were carried out and an extensive amount of evidence was seized."  Europol did not say under which power the second person was detained and a spokesman was not immediately available for comment.  A Distributed Denial of Service attack takes down a website by overwhelming it with traffic. Once a critical point is reached, users will find the site difficult to access. The group is accused of co-ordinating such attacks and demanding money to cease them, thereby allowing normal traffic to flow to the targeted website once more.  The attacks "remain a considerable threat in the European Union and beyond", Europol said.  "This type of extortion attack has become a well-established criminal enterprise and has affected thousands of victims globally, with the number of unreported incidents believed to be much higher. The absence of reporting by private companies and individuals poses particular difficulties in law enforcement's efforts to prosecute these cyber-threats."  It said that the DD4BC group was "exploiting the increasing popularity of pseudonymous payment mechanisms and has been responsible for several Bitcoin extortion campaigns since mid-2014".  According to police, DD4BC "primarily targeted the online gambling industry, but has recently broadened their activity to the financial services and entertainment sector as well as other high-profile companies. Businesses that pay the ransom to the blackmailers risk appearing vulnerable and being targeted again for a higher amount."  Wil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director of operations, said: "These groups employ aggressive measures to silence the victims with the threat of public exposure and reputation damage."	tech

The prime minister said that "on any reasonable assessment", the government is meeting its carbon reduction and sustainability targets.  He also defended a decision to scrap a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project promised in the Tory manifesto.  He was being quizzed by MPs on the Commons Liaison Committee.  Labour MP Huw Irranca-Davis said everyone from the CBI to accountants Ernst and Young had highlighted how the government was falling behind in this area.  But the prime minister cited research suggesting the UK is second only to Denmark in terms of meeting its commitments.  He said the UK's offshore wind market was the largest in the world and 97% of the solar panels in the UK had been installed since he became PM in 2010.  The SNP's Angus MacNeil asked how the government's domestic energy policies would contribute to the worldwide climate agreement.  Mr Cameron said carbon emissions had fallen by 15% since 2010, funding for low carbon energy was being doubled and the UK was the first industrialised country to phase out coal-fired power stations.  "We have been good to doing what we said we would", he said, adding that his government had a "very good record to speak of".  Mr MacNeil then brought up the decision to abandon carbon capture and storage development projects, saying "one hand of government didn't know what the other was doing".  The PM said it was a collective decision taken by the cabinet, arguing that CCS was not as cost-effective as other technologies and the £1bn earmarked for the schemes could be better spent on flood defences and schools.  He had previously said CCS was "absolutely crucial" for the UK, so the decision to scrap a £1bn competition for a large-scale trial was criticised by the MPs.  CCS is the "Holy Grail" of the fossil fuel industry, the BBC's environment analyst Roger Harrabin says.  If it can be made to work economically at industrial scale, it will capture the emissions from power stations that heat the climate, and bury them deep underground.  That would allow coal and gas to be burned in the low-carbon future deemed essential by all governments at the climate summit in Paris.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35291938	Internet Explorer users 'at risk' as tech support ends	Microsoft has ended technical support and security updates for older versions of its Internet Explorer browser.  The changes, which will affect versions 8, 9 and 10 of the browser, were announced in August 2014.  Some estimate that these older browsers account for more than 20% of web traffic while Computerworld claims that only 55% of IE users are using the latest version.  Browsers are often targeted by hackers and experts predict a crop of attacks.  "Beginning January 12, 2016, only the most current version of Internet Explorer available for a supported operating system will receive technical support and security updates," the software giant announced on its website.  "Microsoft encourages customers to upgrade and stay up-to-date on the latest browser for a faster, more secure browsing experience."  It is continuing to support IE 11 and Edge, which is the default browser for Windows 10.  NetMarketShare estimates that Internet Explorer accounts for 57% of the browser market, compared with 25% for Chrome, 12% for Firefox and 5% for Apple's Safari.  According to Computerworld, some 340 million people still rely on older versions of the IE browser.  It has led security experts to warn of a security "hot potato".  "It is safe to assume that cybercriminals have been stockpiling IE vulnerability information ahead of the support cut-off," said Craig Young, a researcher at security firm Tripwire.  Mark James, researcher at security firm ESET added: "No updates, no patches, no fixes, no new versions and no support options if things go wrong. This basically means it's a hot potato and you need to drop it as fast as you can."  Microsoft has been warning users to upgrade for some time but some believe that it has had the reverse effect - drawing users to rival browsers such as Firefox and Chrome.  In April, Microsoft officially stopped security support for Windows XP and while many envisioned a malware explosion it did not materialise.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35291933	Dutch police 'read' Blackberry emails	A Dutch police unit has confirmed to the BBC that it can decrypt messages on Blackberry's most secure smartphones.  It did not go into details about how it does this but said that its methods allow police to read messages.  Troubled phonemaker Blackberry has prided itself on providing customers with one of the safest methods of communication.  In response to the news, it said it could not comment without more information about the crack.  "We are confident that Blackberry provides the world's most secure communications platform to government, military and enterprise customers.  "However, we can't comment on this claim as we don't have any details on the specific device or the way that it was configured, managed or otherwise protected, nor do we have details on the nature of the communications that are claimed to have been decrypted," a spokeswoman told the BBC.  It is believed that the tests were conducted on PGP Blackberrys, handsets with an extra layer of encryption provided by online vendors, such as GhostPGP and TopPGP.  The Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI), a body that provides forensic evidence to Dutch police, was unwilling to provide details on how it decrypted messages from the devices, although it seems that it does need physical access to handsets.  Technology website Motherboard reported that it uses a piece of forensic software made by Cellebrite. Others speculated that the NFI may have removed a memory chip and dumped the data from it.  The NFI could not decrypt all messages. According to Dutch blog Crime News, which first reported the news, 275 out of 325 encrypted emails were cracked.  So-called PGP Blackberrys are advertised as being particularly suited to people wanting to keep data secure and have been linked to criminals in the past.  GhostPGP said that its services had not been compromised.  In 2014, it was reported that such phones were used by those involved in a series of killings in Australia. The Sydney Morning Herald claimed that police officers had travelled to Blackberry headquarters looking for advice on how to access encrypted data on the phones.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35193788	Fracking firms to test ground without planning permission	The government is set to remove another obstacle to the exploration for shale gas deposits in the UK.  Fracking firms will no longer need planning permission to drill boreholes to monitor water quality and carry out seismic monitoring.  The government says the same safety rules for oil and gas exploration will apply - and the use of explosives will be limited to avoid nuisance.  But critics say it will rob local people of a say and cause disruption.  A spokesman for industry body United Kingdom Onshore Oil and Gas said: "This simply brings the onshore oil and gas industry in line with water companies and other industries which drill dozens of boreholes a year and perform subsurface monitoring, including seismic surveys, as a matter of course, with no lasting impact on the environment and hardly anyone noticing."  But anti-fracking campaigners said the changes would give local people less control over what is happening in their area.  In a submission to a government consultation on the changes, one group said: "Seismic testing should be considered only as part of a planning application to drill, explore, test, extract".  Kathryn McWhirter, of Frack Free Balcombe, who wrote the submission, said her main objection was that new planning rules would pave the way for full scale fracking.  "It is a foot in the door. It is the beginning of 'permission creep,'" she told the BBC News website.  "It is taking views away from local councils and local people - and then soon they will have no say at all."  People in the North West of England have complained about tremors and booming noises in their homes, according to the Chester Chronicle.  The firm responsible, Igas, told the newspaper: "The gathering of seismic information has been a common and routine operation in the UK for some 40 years now."  The Department for Communities and Local Government said, in its response to the consultation, published on 17 December, that the move was needed to "enable monitoring and investigation work to be undertaken to inform any future planning application".  Other changes announced by the department will allow for more extensive testing of drinking water impacts, making the move to full-scale production safer.  But anti-fracking campaigners say the planned 24 month water testing regime is not nearly long enough to establish useable data.  The plans, contained in secondary legislation, are due to come before Parliament shortly.  They will also give firms the green light to build 15 metre high drilling rigs to test for methane in groundwater - one of procedures that has to be carried out before commercial fracking can begin. The current maximum height is 12 metres.  Firms will also be allowed to sink boreholes into old mine workings without planning permission.  The DCLG said: "The government considers that it is important to obtain seismic data to inform any potential proposals for petroleum exploration, and it would be beneficial to be able to do this early in the process.  "Having carefully considered the views expressed in response to consultation and the potential impacts, the government considers that it is appropriate to proceed with this proposal."	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35290384	Alton Towers to open virtual reality rollercoaster	Alton Towers has announced plans to open a rollercoaster ride on which passengers wear virtual-reality headsets.  The Staffordshire-based adventure park said Galactica would open in April, following two years of planning.  It is resort's first big new ride since one of its rollercoasters crashed in June, seriously injuring five people.  Visitor numbers have been down since the accident, which Alton Towers blamed on "human error".  It said 190 jobs remained at risk and the park would close on several mid-week "quieter days" this year.  Several virtual-reality recordings simulate rollercoaster rides, but Alton Towers said Galactica would combine the two experiences for the first time.  Over the course of the three-minute ride, the headsets will show passengers a journey across a series of different galaxies, timed to coincide with the ride's twists, turns and falls.  Lying facedown, they will experience a maximum g-force of 3.5gs, which the park says is more than astronauts typically experience during rocket launches.  Gill Riley, the park's marketing director, said it represented a "multi-million pound investment".  "Obviously the safety and welfare of our guests is our number one priority," she added.  "Following the incident last year, we immediately put into effect additional safety protocols on our multi-car rollercoasters, of which this is one.  "In addition, once this ride is installed, as with every other new ride and experience, it will be subject to comprehensive pre-opening assessment [by us] and by an accredited independent inspection body."  Two women had legs amputated after the rollercoaster carriage they were riding in collided with an empty carriage on 2 June.  Fourteen other people on the Smiler ride were also injured.  Alton Towers' owner, Merlin Entertainments, later said the accident had been caused by operator error rather than a mechanical fault.  "A ride shutdown message was misunderstood by staff at the ride," it said in November, adding workers had overridden the control system to manually restart Smiler.  Ms Riley said the park had learned from the mistake.  "We have enhanced our training and also included an extra level of authorisation when we have to stop and reset and restart a ride, which involves senior management," she said.  She confirmed that Smiler was still set to reopen in 2016, but was unable to provide a date.  Merlin Entertainments' share price sank by more than 20% following June's accident, but is currently trading at about 4% below its pre-accident level.  "Certainly, the accident at Alton Towers has been difficult for Merlin and been a drag on its performance, which is not surprising," said Keith Bowman, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.  "But other parts of the business - Legoland in particular - have been making progress and generally compensating for this."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35284800	David Cameron challenged on climate policies	The PM has been accused of double standards over climate change, ahead of a Commons committee appearance.  Select committee chairmen Huw Irranca-Davies (Labour) and Angus MacNeil (SNP) said he has scrapped UK schemes aimed at cutting emissions, despite pledging internationally to protect the climate.  They singled out the decision to axe a carbon capture and storage (CCS) project promised in the Tory manifesto.  The government said the CCS scheme had always been "subject to affordability".  David Cameron is due before the Commons Liaison Committee later, which is made up of MPs who chair Commons select committees.  He will be questioned on climate change, as well as the conflict in Syria.  Mr Cameron had said CCS was "absolutely crucial" for the UK, so the decision to scrap a £1bn competition for a large-scale trial CCS plant is being criticised by the MPs.  CCS is the "Holy Grail" of the fossil fuel industry.  If it can be made to work economically at industrial scale, it will capture the emissions from power stations that heat the climate, and bury them deep underground.  That would allow coal and gas to be burned in the low-carbon future deemed essential by all governments at the climate summit in Paris.  Mr MacNeil, who chairs the energy and climate change committee, told BBC News the decision to scrap the CCS fund was incomprehensible.  He said: "The prime minister said that carbon capture and storage was crucial to meet our climate change targets.  "Yet the government's long-promised carbon capture competition has become the latest low-carbon policy to be chucked on the scrapheap by the government."  Mr MacNeil said "sudden changes" to energy policy were undermining investor confidence in the energy sector.  He added: "The prime minister must acknowledge that building a new generation of gas plants means that we either have to fit power stations with carbon capture technology in the coming decade or potentially bust our carbon budgets."  Mr Irranca-Davies, chairman of the environmental audit committee, added: "We're hearing a growing gulf between the prime minister's bold talk about climate change on the international stage and the short-termism and incoherence of decisions on energy and sustainability at home."  On another issue, Conservative Neil Parish, who chairs the environment, food and rural affairs committee, warned that flood relief would have to be a "much bigger priority" for the government if flooding becomes "the new normal".  In an appearance before the liaison committee in December 2014, Mr Cameron said carbon capture and storage was "absolutely crucial if we are going to decarbonise effectively".  He said more needed to be known about CCS before committing to it, which is why the government committed £1bn for the trial.  Energy industry leaders were astonished when the fund was scrapped without explanation following November's Autumn Statement.  The Department for Energy and Climate Change told the BBC: "The government was clear that this was subject to affordability.  "The Spending Review was a tight financial settlement and difficult decisions have had to be made. CCS (still) has a potential role in the long-term decarbonisation of the UK."  The decision to scrap the CCS trial was applauded by Nigel Lawson's pressure group, the Global Warming Policy Forum.  Its spokesman Benny Peiser told the BBC: "Worldwide, there are currently more than 20 pilot projects being funded.  "Let's wait and see whether the controversial technology will ever be viable at large scale. If so, Britain could simply buy it off the shelf if need be."  But Professor Dieter Helm, from Oxford University, a supporter of many of the government's other energy reforms, said: "It's a no-brainer that the shallow North Sea is the place to try out CCS, with lots of empty holes, pipelines, experience and gas plants nearby.  "So the question is really whether the UK cares about the climate change problem or is merely trying to achieve its carbon production targets at minimum cost."	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35288335	Nine Tory bully victims won't give evidence to inquiry	Nine Tory activists whose claims are at the heart of the party's bullying scandal say they won't give evidence to the inquiry set up to investigate it.  They told BBC Newsnight they have lost faith in the inquiry set up after death of activist Elliott Johnson.  A Conservative spokesman said it was "not appropriate to comment" while the probe is ongoing.  Clifford Chance, the law firm undertaking the inquiry, insists it has made "significant progress to date".  Shortly before he died, 21-year-old Tory activist Mr Elliott complained he was being bullied by Mark Clarke, the director of a campaign which ferried hundreds of young Tories to target seats across the country before last year's general election.  The investigation was set up in November following his death. The news that several victims won't give evidence has raised new fears about its credibility.  Mr Clarke has denied the allegations - but the Conservative Party has revoked his membership and commissioned an investigation amid numerous other claims of bullying and harassment.  The scandal has already led to the resignation of Grant Schapps, a former Tory chairman, and there have been calls for Andrew Feldman, the current Tory chair, to step down too.  Nine potential witnesses have now told Newsnight they have lost faith in the investigation.  Some say it lacks true independence, while others fear they could be targeted for reprisals if they give testimony.  A letter sent out to potential witnesses from the firm appeared to give no firm guarantees that anonymity would be respected.  It said: "We will try to protect the identity of witnesses that give evidence about bullying and harassment by others. However, we may need to put such evidence to other witnesses to hear their version of events. We will try to do so in a way which does not identify the source of the evidence, but we cannot guarantee this will be possible."  One woman invited to give evidence told Newsnight she was too afraid to speak to the firm.  "I am worried that Mark Clarke and his associates will find out who I am, put my ID concretely with what I have said, find out where I live, who I am where, where I work - and that he and his associates will come after me and try to use force and intimidation to try to get me retract what I said."  She added: "If you cannot obtain the confidence of those you are interviewing and those who have been significantly damaged and affected... there is no point conducting an inquiry."  Activist says Tory chairman given bullying dossier in 2010  Josh Hitchens, President of Conservative Future, the activist wing of the Conservative Party at the London School of Economics, said he would not give evidence either.  Last month a confidential complaint he had made to the Tory party last year about Mark Clarke was leaked to the media.  He told Newsnight: "At the moment we have a situation where Clifford Chance are gathering the evidence, the witness transcripts and everything else. They are then passing them directly to the Conservative Party board who will make an assessment of them, edit them and then publish a report with them compiled.  "A significant body of that will contain confidential information from people who are making allegations of an extremely private and sexual nature.  "We don't believe that it is an independent inquiry. That very fact that there is a perception of lack of independence and integrity in the process nullifies it because a lot people who have crucial bodies of evidence aren't willing to submit that evidence because they don't believe it is a fair and independent inquiry."  In a statement to Newsnight, law firm Clifford Chance insisted it would protect potential witnesses.  "We take issues of confidentiality extremely seriously. Where witnesses previously gave evidence to the Conservative Party and were told that their evidence would be kept confidential, or where they request that our discussions with them remain confidential, we will not use that information in our report without their consent."  A Conservative spokesman said: "An investigation is currently underway and it is not appropriate to comment until we can establish the facts.  "The Crossbench Peer Lord Pannick QC has agreed to review the investigative process and to certify that it is objective, appropriate and comprehensive."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35280633	Tesla chief Elon Musk says Apple is making an electric car	Tesla's owner, Elon Musk, has said it is an "open secret" that Apple is making a rival electric car.  He also predicted vehicles that could not drive themselves would become a "strange anachronism" before too long.  The tech entrepreneur's comments were made during an exclusive interview with the BBC at his design studio near Los Angeles.  Tesla vies with Nissan and BMW to be the world's bestselling electric-car brand, but currently runs at a loss.  An added challenge is that over recent months several of its engineers have been hired by rivals, including China-backed Faraday Future and Apple.  Apple has not formally announced it is working on a vehicle, although it did recently register several automobile-related internet domains, including apple.car and apple.auto.  Mr Musk said it was "obvious" that the company would try to make a compelling car of its own.  "It's pretty hard to hide something if you hire over a thousand engineers to do it," he said.  But he did not see the iPhone-maker as a threat.  "It will expand the industry," he said.  "Tesla will still aspire to make the most compelling electric vehicles, and that would be our goal, while at the same helping other companies to make electric cars as well."  Mr Musk outlined a vision of a future where all cars would be electric and autonomous, and driving yourself would become a hobby rather than a necessity.  Tesla's Model S - a sports car that ranges from £56,000 to £85,000 depending on the chosen battery capacity and performance - has been one of the bestselling electric cars of recent years.  In recent months, its Autopilot feature has given the car a number autonomous driving features:  Last weekend, it gained a new "beta" feature that allows owners to summon their car with their smartphone.  "[With] the current version of Summon, the car will come and find you if you're on private property," Mr Musk said.  "The car will exit the garage, close the garage behind it and come over to you.  "This is the first baby step - ultimately you'll be able to summon the car from New York if you're living in LA, and it will drive across the country, charge itself at the various locations and come to you."  This may sound like a vision of the distant future, but Mr Musk says it could be feasible in "a couple of years."  At both last week's Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas and this week's Detroit Motor Show, a number of other car makers have shown off innovations in electric vehicles and automated driving.  Mr Musk said electrification and autonomy were the two biggest innovations in the industry since the moving production line.  "In the long term, nobody will buy a car unless it's autonomous," he said.  "Owning a car that is not self-driving in the long term will be like owning a horse - you would own it and use it for sentimental reasons but not for daily use."  At this stage, Tesla produces only luxury models and is still making big losses.  Its founder admitted that its future would depend on the cheaper Model 3 version, which he said would go into production at the end of 2017.  "Unless there's an affordable car, we will only have a small impact on the world.  "We need to make a car that most people can afford, in order to have a substantial impact."  Mr Musk has two other businesses, rocket company Space X and energy supplier SolarCity.  Space X has also lost huge sums since it was founded, but last month it succeeded in landing its Falcon rocket upright after launching satellites into orbit.  Mr Musk now hopes to repeat the feat, using a floating barge in the Pacific Ocean as the landing pad.  He said making rockets reusable would transform the economics of the space industry.  "At the beginning I thought Space X and Tesla had a 10% chance of success. So, I'm quite surprised to see we're alive," he said.  Space X is in fierce competition with Blue Origin, the rocket business owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos - but when asked about the rivalry Mr Musk answered: "Jeff who?"	tech

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35281203	Labour's Catherine McKinnell quits shadow cabinet	Shadow attorney general Catherine McKinnell has resigned from the shadow cabinet, citing concerns over Labour's direction under Jeremy Corbyn.  Ms McKinnell said Labour was heading down an "increasingly negative path" amid "internal conflict" stemming from the recent shadow cabinet reshuffle.  The first shadow cabinet member to quit since Mr Corbyn's reshuffle also cited family reasons and a desire to speak in Parliament outside her legal brief.  She has been replaced by Karl Turner.  Mr Turner, the MP for Kingston upon Hull East, is the former shadow solicitor general.  Just hours before Ms McKinnell's resignation, Mr Corbyn claimed the party was "moving on" from the internal ructions of recent weeks.  Last week's reshuffle saw the exit of shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden and former shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher - two critics of the leader - and the demotion of shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle to culture spokeswoman. Three other shadow ministers resigned in protest at the changes.  In her resignation letter, Ms McKinnell said being in the shadow cabinet had prevented her from speaking up on issues of importance to her constituents and that she felt she could serve them better as a backbencher.  The MP for Newcastle Upon Tyne North also said she was finding it more difficult to balance her professional and family commitments since the birth of her third child last year.  But she also expressed concerns about the "situation in which Labour now finds itself".  "As somebody who came into politics with the sole motivation of making life better for my city, my region and, by extension, the country as a whole, I recognised that our electoral defeats in both 2010 and 2015 demanded a genuine and profound response from the Labour Party," she wrote.  "I therefore shared your optimism for the 'new kind of politics' you spoke so compellingly about.  "However, as events have unfolded over recent weeks, my concern about the direction and internal conflict within the Labour party has only grown and I fear this is taking us down an increasingly negative path.  "I feel that I would like to channel my energy constructively, into making positive changes for my constituents."  Speaking on the BBC earlier, Mr Corbyn defended the changes he had made to the shadow cabinet, saying they had brought more "diversity" into his top team and he was "happy" with the new line-up.  "We have a team which is strong," he told Radio 4's Today.  "We have widened the shadow cabinet to represent the diversity of the country and the membership of the Parliamentary Labour Party.  "I am happy with it. We are moving on."  But the BBC's Carole Walker said the latest resignation underlined the difficulties Mr Corbyn was having in moulding a shadow cabinet in his own image and reconciling the difficulties that existed in the Labour party.  Reacting to her departure, shadow justice secretary Lord Falconer told the Daily Politics that Ms McKinnell had been an "incredibly effective" performer in her post and that she would be a loss to the shadow cabinet.  He said while it was inevitable that reshuffles were a "flashpoint for differences", the party had to pull together and move on.  Shadow Treasury minister Richard Burgon said the "vast majority of Labour MPs agree on the vast majority of things".  Ms McKinell has held a number of frontbench positions since entering Parliament at the 2010 election. As shadow attorney general, she was responsible for providing legal office to Mr Corbyn and senior colleagues.  In another development, Dewsbury MP Paula Sherriff has resigned as a ministerial aide to shadow communities secretary John Trickett.  She tweeted that she had stepped down to campaign against "Tory cuts" and to focus on her work on the health select committee.  Mr Corbyn was not present as Labour MPs gathered for the first time since the reshuffle on Monday evening.  Labour's general secretary, Iain McNicol, told the Parliamentary Labour Party meeting any change to the way the party makes policy would have to be agreed at its annual conference.  It follows Mr Corbyn's expressed desire to involve the wider party membership in policy-making.  At the next meeting, MPs are to put forward a motion that would remove his aide from the party's ruling National Executive Committee.  BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said some Labour MPs were unhappy at the position on the NEC - usually reserved for a backbench MP - being held by someone in Mr Corbyn's team.  If the motion is successful, the aide in question - Mr Corbyn's Parliamentary Private Secretary Steve Rotheram - would have to resign.  The motion says: "Rotheram is well liked, but removing him would free up a space on the committee, and his replacement would be chosen by a vote of Labour MPs, rather than the leader's office."  The Labour leader is hoping to change his party's policy on one of the issues on which it is divided, the renewal of the UK's nuclear weapons system.  But there was a warning for his anti-Trident stance from Paul Kenny, of the GMB union, who said he would be asking tens of thousands of workers "what they think about the Labour Party effectively shutting down their jobs".  He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One unions would not go "quietly into the night" if the policy was changed.	politics

The PM said new mothers and teenagers with anorexia were among those who would benefit from improved services.  He also promised to flatten "sink estates", help families save, and more funding for parenting classes.  Labour said the PM had previously cut mental health spending, and the new pledges were "too little, too late".  Mr Cameron defended controversial education reforms, and praised "Tiger Mothers" who pushed children to succeed.  It was "the precise opposite of the 'all must have prizes' culture", he said, insisting that "children thrive on high expectation".  Setting out what he called a "lifecycle approach" at the charity Family Action in north London, Mr Cameron said many people now experienced "paucity of opportunity" rather than material poverty - although he acknowledged some of the latter did still exist.  Reforms would focus on four key areas - family life and early years; education; equal opportunity; and treatable problems such as mental health and addiction.  Improving family life was "the best anti-poverty measure ever", he said, promising to double funding for relationship counselling and to provide careers guidance and mentors, costing £70m over the next five years.  He also announced a relaunch of a coalition policy of parenting classes, which was criticised after a low take-up in a pilot scheme.  He said he wanted it to become "normal, even aspirational, to attend parenting courses", and his strategy would examine voucher schemes or other incentives to encourage people to attend.  The government also wanted to help build families' financial resilience, and planned to bring forward a scheme to help people on low incomes save, he said, adding that full details would be announced in the next Budget.  On education, he said state schools must learn from "elite schools", and teach character virtues and resilience as well as knowledge.  This included teaching "curiosity, honesty, perseverance and service", as well as the value of "hard work and concentration, and coming back from failure - the Tiger Mother's battle hymn".  The government would provide £1bn over four years for the National Citizen Service in England and Northern Ireland to show young people "the power of public service, not just self service", he said.  He hoped it would cover 60% of all 16 year olds, and become the largest scheme of its kind in Europe, he said.  On improving opportunities for all, he promised cash for a mentoring scheme targeting pupils at risk of dropping out of school, and plans to spend £140m to tear down "brutal" housing estates in England which he said "design crime in, rather than design crime out".  Mr Cameron also used his speech to promise action on "treatable problems", including mental illnesses and addiction.  Calling for a "more mature" conversation about mental health, he said new mothers and teenagers with anorexia would be among those to benefit from £1bn extra cash that was allocated in the Autumn Statement.  The PM also pledged more psychiatric support in hospital A&E departments, and for community services.  The specific measures on mental health, which will apply in England only, include:  Labour said mental health spending had dropped on David Cameron's watch, and the new announcements were "too little, too late".  Lucy Powell, Labour's shadow education secretary, said David Cameron was "fond of making speeches about families but absolutely woeful in following through".  The closure of many Sure Start children's centres, and "huge cuts to family support services, tax credit and welfare changes" had left "many, many more families in crisis", she said.  Lib Dem spokesman Norman Lamb, who was a health minister during the coalition government, said the PM's mental health plans "fell well short" of the ambitions set out by his party and the Conservatives in 2014.  "It will leave a disparity between physical health and mental health at the heart of our NHS. That is morally wrong and economically stupid," he said.	politics

The veteran Labour MP for Islington North was elected party leader with nearly 60% of the vote in the wake of the party's 2015 election defeat. A left-winger first elected to Parliament in 1983, Mr Corbyn championed a range of causes such as unilateral nuclear disarmament and opposition to military intervention abroad that, during the 1990s and noughties, left him on the fringes of the party. But his anti-austerity message and the support of new members propelled him to a shock victory. Since becoming leader, he has brought a different tone to Prime Minister's Questions but faced dissent from within Labour over issues such as Syria and Trident.  A former trade union official who once shared a flat with Unite leader Len McCluskey, Mr Watson entered Parliament in 2001 as MP for West Bromwich. He was a government whip and defence minister under Tony Blair, but resigned in 2006, calling for the then prime minister to quit in the interests of the Labour Party and the country. An ally of Gordon Brown, he was a Cabinet Office minister and deputy party chairman under his government. Mr Watson is known for campaigning on issues including phone hacking, surveillance laws and historical child abuse.  Shadow first secretary of state, shadow business, innovation and skills secretary - Angela Eagle  Angela Eagle had been tipped as a potential shadow chancellor but has been given the business brief instead. She was also announced as shadow first secretary of state and has deputised for Mr Corbyn at Prime Minister's Questions when David Cameron is away. The MP for Wallasey stood in the deputy leadership contest and was also a cabinet minister under Gordon Brown. As shadow leader of the Commons her weekly Business questions session will have been good practice for PMQs.  The veteran Labour leftwinger is best friends with Mr Corbyn and co-ordinated his election campaign. It is thought he was promised the top job some time ago. The MP for Hayes and Harlington previously stood for Labour leader in 2007 and 2010.  A prominent rebel, he recently declared he would "swim through vomit" to vote against benefit cuts and faced criticism for telling a union event that he would "like to go back to the 1980s and assassinate Thatcher".  He sparked outrage in 2003 by saying IRA terrorists should be "honoured" for taking part in their "armed struggle", while attending a gathering to commemorate the IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands.  Seema Malhotra became MP for the London seat of Feltham and Heston in 2011 in a by-election following the death of Alan Keen. In August 2014, she was given the newly-created role of shadow minister for preventing violence against women and girls, by the then Labour leader Ed Miliband. She will be Mr McDonnell's number two in the shadow Treasury team.  Defeated leadership contender Andy Burnham served as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary in Gordon Brown's government. The MP for Leigh - who came fourth out of five contenders in the 2010 battle and came second to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 - was also previously shadow health secretary. In April 2009, having been booed at the 20th anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster, he began a campaign that eventually led to the second Hillsborough inquiry. Having lost out to Mr Corbyn in the leadership contest, he said the priority was to "unite and to take on the Tories".  Hilary Benn remains as shadow foreign secretary despite speculation that he would be moved in a reshuffle. The MP, son of the former cabinet minister Tony Benn, has had highly public differences of opinion with Mr Corbyn over how to confront so-called Islamic State. He voted to approve UK bombing of militants in Syria, making a passionate speech from the dispatch box contradicting his leader's position. Mr Benn served as a minister in both the Blair and Brown governments, and was shadow secretary of state for communities and local government in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet. He faced Chancellor George Osborne in Prime Minister's Questions in June, while David Cameron was away in Europe.  A former government minister for transport, work and pensions and local government at different times under Gordon Brown, she retains the crucial job of shadow chief whip. Ms Winterton, a former aide to John Prescott, filled the same role throughout Ed Miliband's leadership. She could face some tough challenges managing the different wings of the party.  A former party whip under Ed Miliband's leadership, the MP for Lewisham East may be unknown to many outside Westminster. She has previously campaigned against the closure of Lewisham Hospital's A&E department.  The Manchester Central MP, elected in 2012, is close to Ed Miliband and was vice-chair of Labour's general election campaign. During the leadership campaign she said she had "never, ever met or spoken to" Mr Corbyn since becoming an MP. After being appointed, she said education was a subject she was "passionate" about.  The former shadow Welsh secretary said it was a "great honour" to be appointed to the work and pensions brief. Before entering politics, he spent 10 years working as a BBC journalist.  The Islington South MP was promoted to the shadow cabinet in January 2016 during a protracted reshuffle, which led to the sacking of two leading shadow ministers - Michael Dugher and Pat McFadden - and the resignation of a number of junior spokesmen in protest. Ms Thornberry, the wife of a High Court judge, was a ministerial aide under Gordon Brown and served as shadow attorney general under Ed Miliband. However, she was sacked in November 2014 after posting a tweet of an image of a white van outside a house bedecked with St George's flags on the eve of the Rochester by-election - a tweet construed to be disparaging and for which she apologised. She has since rehabilitated herself and, after nominating Mr Corbyn in the leadership election, was made a work and pensions spokeswomen.  Lord Falconer is to continue as shadow justice secretary, having initially been appointed by acting leader Harriet Harman. A former flatmate and close ally of former prime minister Tony Blair, he served as Lord Chancellor under the Blair government.  Mr Trickett, the MP for Hemsworth, was one of Jeremy Corbyn's most senior backers in the Parliamentary Labour Party. He was shadow minister without portfolio and deputy chairman under Ed Miliband's leadership. He has dismissed claims Labour lost the general election because it was too left wing, saying there was a "gulf between the population and political class".  The Wigan MP, seen as being on the left of the party, has previously been a shadow Cabinet Office and education minister. Left wing journalist Owen Jones says he considered starting a campaign to make her leader after Ed Miliband.  The MP for the Rhondda moves from the job of shadow culture secretary. Mr Bryant, who backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership contest, has also been the shadow work and pensions, and Home Office, minister. He was offered the job of shadow defence secretary but turned it down due to disagreements with Mr Corbyn on defence policy.  The Nottingham South MP has represented the seat since 2010. She has been promoted from shadow rail minister under Ed Miliband's leadership.  The MP for Gedling returns to the position he filled in Ed Miliband's shadow cabinet from 2010-13. He later became shadow defence secretary. Mr Coaker - who chaired Yvette Cooper's Labour leadership campaign - was also minister for schools under Gordon Brown.  Another left-wing MP, she stood in the Labour leadership contest in 2010 - losing to Ed Miliband - and was defeated in this year's London mayoral candidate election. A prominent rebel against the Blair and Brown governments, she voted against the party line on issues including a third runway for Heathrow, renewing the UK's Trident nuclear submarine system, tuition fees and the war in Iraq. She is MP for the east London seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.  He continues as shadow Scotland secretary, having initially been given the role by acting leader Harriet Harman in May. The MP for Edinburgh South is the only current Labour MP in Scotland.  The MP for Llanelli since 2005. She was shadow minister for Wales under the last leadership and also served as a shadow business minister. Ms Griffith said she was "very honoured" to be appointed to the shadow cabinet.  The Bristol East MP, first elected in 2005, has previously shadowed positions in the Foreign Office, Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions. She is also a vegan and campaigns on food issues.

The MP for Stretford and Urmston was promoted to the shadow cabinet by Jeremy Corbyn.  The identical twin sister of the party's new business spokeswoman, Angela Eagle. The Garston and Halewood MP was previously shadow defence secretary but was moved to the less high-profile brief in January 2016 after clashing with Mr Corbyn over the UK's Trident nuclear weapons system. In contrast to the Labour leader, Ms Eagle was in favour of renewing Trident. She also voted to support air strikes against Islamic State in Syria.  The former GMTV reporter has represented Ashfield since the 2010 general election. She served as a shadow culture minister and shadow Home Office minister under Ed Miliband, before being appointed as a shadow minister for women and equalities in 2013.  The Liverpool Wavertree MP backed Andy Burnham in the leadership election. She was a shadow health minister under Ed Miliband.  The Labour MP for Basildon until 2010, Baroness Smith served as a Cabinet Office minister under Gordon Brown's government. She keeps the position she has held since May.  Former leader of Brighton and Hove City Council, he has held the chief whip position since May 2010.  The Leicester South MP was a shadow Cabinet Office minister under Ed Miliband. He backed Yvette Cooper in the leadership election over his Leicester neighbour Liz Kendall, telling the Leicester Mercury he had agonised over the decision.  Mr Healey is shadowing a portfolio he held under Gordon Brown. The Wentworth and Dearne held a range of post during the Labour government, including financial secretary to the Treasury and local government minister.  The MP for Hull East took over the role of Labour's chief legal adviser after the resignation of Catherine McKinnell. Mr Turner represents the seat once held by deputy prime minister John Prescott. He was previously shadow solicitor general	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35279234	David Bowie: The internet pioneer	David Bowie is best remembered for his music - but he was also groundbreaking in his use of technology, not least his internet service, BowieNet, which launched in September 1998.  In a time before Instagram, YouTube, Twitter or even MySpace, most artists provided little if any online material to their followers.  But Bowie's platform not only offered a wide variety of exclusive content, but also several ways to interact with the singer himself.  "In my view, BowieNet had to be the most groundbreaking reachout to fans that I have ever seen any artist ever do," Craig Carrington, one of its users, says.  "He just had the attitude that if he was going to do it, he was going to do it right."  BowieNet also operated as a full internet service provider (ISP) in the US and UK, competing with AOL, Claranet and others.  For a monthly fee, members got an @davidbowie.com-ending email address and exclusive access to audio recordings, music videos and chat rooms, which the singer participated in himself.  "He would never announce it in advance, but he would get on to the chat board and talk to us. The handle he always called himself by was Sailor," says Mr Carrington.  "Sometimes he would bring on a special guest for an interview, other times he would say things like, 'I just discovered this new act, who you probably haven't heard of yet.'"  Other content included personal photos Bowie had uploaded and images of his paintings as well as access to some of his journals.  To be fair, not everyone was sold on the idea.  As one article from the time noted, a follower said she wished that Bowie would spend more time writing new music, while another questioned what message the email address would send out if he used it for business correspondence.  But one biographer said that, like much of Bowie's work, it proved to be influential.  "It was very ahead of its time," says Chris O'Leary, author of Rebel Rebel.  "Back then, other rock star web pages were kind of cupboard sites that maybe had one picture of them and a little bit of text and that was it.  "This was really the first attempt to create an internet community built around an artist. And it was very successful too."  Bowie also used the service to create what became known as the world's first "cyber-song".  Fans were invited to send in lyrics to help co-write a track, and 80,000 people responded.  The singer said he had read through many himself - "there were a lot of potty ones", he told one journalist - and eventually chose a submission by a 20-year-old American about the idea of having a virtual life on the internet.  Fans were invited to watch the track being recorded via a 360-degree interactive webcast - a technology that is only just becoming commonplace today.  The song, What's Really Happening?, later featured on the Hours... album.  The singer's fondness for new forms of communication was also apparent with BowieWorld - a 3D chat environment offered via his site, which pre-dated Second Life.  "It took a couple of minutes to download, but was completely new for the internet," says Mr Carrington.  "It gave the illusion that you were going through a three-dimensional city, and you saw decorations that he put all over the place - favourite posters and pictures of himself.  "You had an avatar - a creature or a person you controlled - and you could move around the environment and interact with others."  At the end of 1999, the singer also became involved in video games, when he appeared in Quantic Dream's Omikron.  "It was relatively unprecedented to have such a big star embody a character within a game and not just appear as a thinly veiled version of themselves," says Thomas McMullan, a tech journalist who played Omikron as a teenager.  "And Bowie engaged to a level that went beyond just lending his face. He worked on it from a musical point-of-view as well.  "A bit that really sticks in my memory is a secret concert that you could discover if you uncovered some clues, and it showed you a clip of him playing in a fictional band. It felt like sneaking into an underground concert."  Bowie also embraced technology for some of his more mainstream activities.  To write his 1995 concept album Outside, he used a specially created piece of software called Verbasizer.  The singer typed in dozens of sentences into the Mac program, which then randomly selected words, "slamming" them into each other to create lyrics of its own, which Bowie used as a source of inspiration.  He was also one of the first artists to release an "internet-only" single. Telling Lies was downloaded by more than 300,000 people before later being sold as a physical single.  Bowie also took part in 1999's Netaid charity concert, which was streamed on the web to more than two million people, a record for its time.  In 2004, he sponsored an online contest for fans to create new "mashes" of his music, but as the years went by he became a more remote presence.  "When he had talked to us, he came across as very caring and compassionate - he could be very fatherly, especially with the younger visitors," says Mr Carrington.  "But about seven or eight years ago, although you could still log into BowieNet, there didn't seem to be many updates, and we were wondering what was happening.  In 2006, Bowie's ISP business was quietly retired, but it was not until 2012 that his Facebook page confirmed what many already knew.  "BowieNet, as we have known it, is kaput!" it said.  The DavidBowie.com website was relaunched in 2013 to coincide with the release of his album The Next Day, but it was a pretty standard affair.  "He did have a health scare in the mid-2000s - that was maybe more serious than was let on," says Mr O'Leary.  "He kind of retreated into his personal life and didn't want to be the guy who is there for you all the time on the internet.  "When he did come back, possibly he just wanted to concentrate all of his efforts on his art and not deal with the social internet side of it.  "But what he did earlier was unprecedented, and it will be part of his legacy."	tech

The company said it had been running tests for more than a year, but had started running practical tests in a controlled environment.  Snow presents a challenge to driverless cars because the sensors they use to detect road markings and hazards do not work well in wintery weather.  Google has also been testing its autonomous vehicles in the snow.  Driverless cars use Light Detection and Ranging (Lidar) sensors to build a detailed view of the world around them.  Lidar works by rapidly firing laser light away from the car and measuring how much light is reflected back - a similar principle to radar, which uses radio waves instead.  But these sensors do not work well in snowy conditions, and the car's onboard cameras cannot see road markings obscured by snow.  Ford said it had instead programmed the Lidar sensors to map landmarks above the ground, such as buildings and road signs.  The car could then compare this information to an existing high-resolution map of the road stored in its computer.  This allowed the car to navigate the road even when visibility was poor.  Ford is the first manufacturer to test its vehicles in a model city built by the University of Michigan.  "We're used to the conditions changing very rapidly. As humans, we understand that can happen and we know how to deal with it," said Greg Stevens, who leads driver assistance research at Ford.  "We need to make sure that our autonomous vehicles can also deal with those situations in the same way."  Rival car manufacturers such as Tesla, as well as technology giants Uber and Google, are also testing self-driving vehicles.  Tesla has already released a car with an "autopilot" feature that can take over driving on some roads.  On Sunday, the company revealed that it was developing an app that would let owners summon their car from a distance.  Tesla's Model S and X cars can already drive themselves out of a garage when summoned, but the company's owner, Elon Musk, told the BBC that people would eventually be able to summon their car across thousands of miles.	tech

The infiltration began shortly after 21:00 GMT, and at least four messages were broadcast to his 384,000 followers.  One mocked Prime Minister David Cameron by stating: "davey cameron is a pie".  Mr Corbyn's team quickly regained control of the @jeremycorbyn account and the offending tweets were deleted.  The Labour leader mostly tweets about party policy so the first of the hacked messages, which began "Here we... here we..." and contained three exclamation marks, would have alerted his followers to the fact that something was not quite right.  A minute later, the hacker posted the message about Mr Cameron, followed almost immediately by one which poked fun at Mr Corbyn's opposition to the Trident nuclear missile programme.	politics

They changed the lyrics of hit Cradle to the Grave to sing the line: "There are some here who are hell bent on the destruction of the welfare state."  Mr Cameron had been interviewed on the show and was watching the band's closing performance.  The band later tweeted about its "third verse message" for the PM.  Squeeze, formed in South London in 1974, reached the peak of their popularity in the late 1970s and early 1980s with songs including "Cool for Cats", "Up the Junction" and "Tempted".  In the adapted version, front man Glenn Tilbrook also added the line: "I grew up in council houses, part of what made Britain great".  A BBC spokeswoman said producers had not been aware of Squeeze's protest beforehand.  Downing Street said it was not commenting on performance.	politics

The shadow justice secretary said the cabinet changes had been "an amazing distraction" from the country's issues.  But he said he "certainly wouldn't have fired" former Europe spokesman Pat McFadden, who Mr Corbyn sacked.  Meanwhile, Alison McGovern has resigned from a party policy review group saying she could not work with the leadership.  It comes days after three shadow ministers quit in protest at the reshuffle.  Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Lord Falconer insisted the Labour Party remains a "broad church" but to be effective that broad church must not be "at war with itself".  "The country needs an effective opposition," he told the BBC.  "The floods, the junior doctors about to go on strike for the first time in 40 years, what's going on with Britain's support for the justice system in Saudi Arabia, these are issues that we should be focusing on. They are just examples.  "We as a party, in the wake of the reshuffle, which is an amazing distraction from all of these issues, need to be coming together and doing the work to provide an alternative to this government, which is a very bad government."  When Lord Falconer was asked if he would have made the same decision as Mr Corbyn in the sacking of Mr McFadden from the shadow cabinet, he said: "The decision as to who is in and who is out of the shadow front bench team is entirely a matter for the leader."  But when pushed on the issue again, Lord Falconer said: "I certainly wouldn't have fired him."  Mr McFadden was given marching orders from his role as shadow Europe spokesman for apparent disloyalty.  Another shadow cabinet member, education spokeswoman Lucy Powell, told the BBC Two's Daily Politics: "We need to draw a line under last week's events and move on."  Labour should "realign our fire not on each other... but on this government," Ms Powell said.  She said the resignation of Ms McGovern - MP for Wirral South and chairman of Blairite pressure group Progress - from a child poverty policy review was "a shame because I think she has a huge amount to offer".  One of the key policy issues dividing Labour is whether to renew Trident, the UK's nuclear deterrent.  Mr Corbyn is opposed to nuclear weapons, and replaced his pro-Trident defence spokeswoman Maria Eagle with Emily Thornberry, who thinks it should be scrapped, in the reshuffle.  However, Ms Powell said she would be "very surprised" if Labour came out in favour of unilateral disarmament following its defence review.	politics

Lord Falconer told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that "I certainly wouldn't have fired him".

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, the prime minister has said he wants "affordable housing" and there should be a "big shift towards more affordable housing to buy".  A panel to be chaired by Lord Heseltine will report on how investment from bodies like pension funds might be unlocked and draw up a list of sites that could benefit from regeneration.	politics

Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Cameron said that he would abide by what the British public said, adding: "I hope that answer will be staying in a reformed Europe".  The government has promised to hold an in-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, once the prime minister has negotiated reforms to Britain's relationship with the 28-member bloc.	politics

Alison McGovern told the BBC the shadow chancellor had suggested the group she chairs, Progress, co-ordinated the resignation of three shadow ministers.  John McDonnell also accused Progress of having a "hard-right agenda", Ms McGovern said.  Labour said the review she said she was quitting had not yet been launched.  Ms McGovern's resignation comes after junior shadow ministers Jonathan Reynolds, Stephen Doughty, and Kevan Jones quit on Wednesday in protest at Labour's reshuffle this week.  The resignation of Mr Doughty on BBC Two's Daily Politics led to an official complaint from Labour, who accused the BBC of orchestrating the resignation for maximum "political impact" - something the BBC denies.  Ms McGovern, the Wirrall South MP, said Mr McDonnell had asked her to take part in the Labour's policy review on child poverty and combating inequality.  The pair were due to meet for the second time to discuss the subject on Wednesday, but Ms McGovern claims Mr McDonnell was late because he was making media appearances.  She told BBC's Sunday Politics: "So I'm there waiting to meet him to talk about it and all the while he'd gone to the TV studio to call the organisation that I am chair of 'hard-right Conservative', of having a hard-right Conservative agenda. That's not OK."  "We are all Labour members and we believe in having a Labour government - that's what we are, nothing more nothing less.  "And, as I say, I don't want to be on the telly talking about this but I have been backed into a corner and I have got no other choice now but to stand up and say 'this is who we are' and we should just get on with the business of getting a Labour government."  Progress is broadly seen as the Blairite wing of the party.  On Wednesday Mr McDonnell told BBC Radio Two's Jeremy Vine programme: "We've had a few junior members resign today and of course that's their right.  "But they do all come from a narrow right-wing clique within the Labour Party based around the organisation Progress.  "I don't believe they have ever accepted Jeremy's mandate."  A Labour Party spokesman said: "Alison McGovern was invited to a discussion on child poverty but the initiative has not been launched or confirmed.  "She is resigning from something that doesn't exist."  Sunday Politics is on BBC One on Sunday at 11:00 GMT.	politics

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35264042	Yes, Prime Minister: Still true to life after 30 years?	Thirty years ago, on 9th January 1986, Michael Heseltine picked up his papers from the cabinet table, and walked out of Number 10, precipitating a political crisis for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.  On BBC One that evening, the Nine O'Clock News picked apart the political entrails.  At the same time, on BBC Two, in sitcom land, Britain was getting used to a new face in Downing Street, Jim Hacker. It was the first episode of Yes, Prime Minister.  Hacker's weekly battles with Cabinet Secretary, Sir Humphrey Appleby, were comedy, but talking to those who were in Whitehall and Westminster at the time, it sometimes seemed more like a fly-on-the -wall documentary.  Back then, Richard Mottram was a young civil servant in charge of Mr Heseltine's office. Speaking to me for Hackers And Humphreys All, on BBC Radio 4 Extra, he underlined how life was not so far away from art.  "I said to him (Heseltine) 'have you told anyone?' because, being a good civil servant, I thought if he hasn't told anyone, we can always sort of 'un-resign' him. And he said 'Yes, I told the cameraman on the door', and then I realised we were doomed."  Jim Hacker began his screen life as a peripheral member of the cabinet in Yes, Minister (1980-1984), created and written by Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn.  The late Paul Eddington gave a memorable performance, bumbling from crisis to crisis, manipulated and checked by the late Nigel Hawthorne, who won successive BAFTAs for his verbal circumlocutions as Sir Humphrey.  Perhaps the biggest challenge for Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, the creators of the series, was making Hacker's elevation to Number 10 credible.  Lynn told me: "There have been a large number of barely competent prime ministers and Hacker joins that rogue's gallery".  "He looked more regal when I said to him I think you're going to be prime minister… he loved the idea," says Lynn.  Perhaps more important than the performances of the three main actors - Derek Fowlds as Bernard Woolley, Hacker's Principal Private Secretary, was the third member of the triumvirate who were in every episode of both programmes - was the quality of the writing.  Research was conducted over long lunches with politicians and officials. Most are unknown, but some are so proud of their association with the programme that they've outed themselves.  Antony Jay, a former TV current affairs producer, also had good contacts of his own, having written speeches for leading Conservative politicians, including Geoffrey Howe.  Margaret Thatcher was a great fan of the series. The programme filmed exteriors in Downing Street, Eddington was allowed to walk through the famous door as Prime Minister Hacker, and the production designer was even given a personal tour. The result was a near perfect reproduction on screen of the cabinet room.  In 1984, Mrs Thatcher offered a tribute of her own to Yes Minister.  Asked to present an award to the writers, with her Press Secretary Bernard Ingham she devised a sketch, which she would perform at the ceremony with Eddington and Hawthorne in front of the media.  When she arrived at the venue, she told waiting journalists they would be witnessing "the premiere of Yes, Prime Minister".  At that stage, the writers hadn't even considered sending Hacker to Downing Street. The actors - neither of them admirers of Mrs Thatcher - didn't want to do it. Neither, though, wanted to provoke her displeasure by saying no.  In the 30 years since, Jonathan Lynn has lived in the United States, writing for the big screen and directing films, including My Cousin Vinny. Despite his experiences in Hollywood, he's still astonished by the time and resources lavished on the awards ceremony sketch, including blanket coverage by the media.  "They rehearsed it at Number 10 23 times. My reaction was: 'what the hell?, why weren't they running the country? What were they doing, rehearsing a sketch 23 times?" Then he pauses for a beat, adding with perfect comic timing, "A bad sketch".  He got his revenge when he and Jay accepted the award, congratulating the prime minister on "finally taking her rightful place in the field of situation comedy. It got, I think, maybe the biggest laugh of my career". Mrs Thatcher, he says, did not laugh.  Mrs Thatcher's sketch proposed the abolition of economists. In their version of life in Number Ten, Jay and Lynn got the laughs with more realistic scenarios. Some of them even went on to come true.  In The National Education Service - one of four complete episodes included in Humphreys And Hackers All - the prime minister considers giving parents the power to choose schools. The debate between the characters prefigures much of what was said during Tony Blair's attempts to change education.  "I actually remember a debate around the cabinet table", Mr Blair told me, "and people actually saying you shouldn't do that because then the other schools in the area who aren't performing adequately will feel very disgruntled by introducing this centre of excellence into the local community."  Mr Blair says his sympathies were always with his fictional Downing Street predecessor, Jim Hacker (whose political affiliations were never revealed), but he professes a sneaking admiration for Sir Humphrey Appleby.  Lord Donoughue, now a Labour peer, was Head of the Downing Street Policy Unit between 1974 and 1979. He suggested ideas for Yes, Minister and Yes, Prime Minister and checked the scripts for accuracy.  But he says some of his fellow ministers in Mr Blair's government had paid a bit too much attention to the programme.  "It either made politicians and ministers sort of vary wary of taking civil advice, or because it demoralised a bit the civil service", he says, noting that some of his ministerial contemporaries, having watched Sir Humphrey's attempts to manipulate Hacker would sometime refuse to take sound advice.  The fictional Prime Minister Hacker has had four real life successors.  "I once had to write an essay on 'How true to life is Yes, Minister'", he recalled. "I think I wrote… that it wasn't true to life. I can tell you, as prime minister, it is true to life."  Shaun Ley presents Humphreys And Hackers All on BBC Radio 4 extra, on Saturday morning at 0900 GMT and again at 1900 GMT. It will also be available on the BBC iPlayer.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35261637	BNP removed from official list of political parties	The British National Party risks being unable to stand for election - because it failed to pay its annual £25 registration fee.  Under the Political Parties and Referendums Act 2000 all parties need to confirm their registration details with the Electoral Commission.  But despite having six months notice, the BNP missed the deadline.  BNP spokesman Stephen Squire said: "It's the first I've heard of it - it's obviously an oversight."  But former BNP leader Nick Griffin, who was expelled by the party in 2014, told LBC Radio the mistake was "either incompetence or it's a combination of a deliberate wrecking job which has been going on over the last year or so."  However, BNP chairman Adam Walker said the "media frenzy" created by the technical oversight "proves how relevant and newsworthy the BNP is."  By law, the Electoral Commission has to remove from its register any political party that fails to submit its details.  The BNP's statement of accounts were due on 7 July 2015, but despite a six-month window, the party had still not paid up by the final deadline on 7 January 2016, forcing the commission to take action.  Removal from the register means BNP candidates cannot use the party's name, description or emblems on ballot papers at elections.  But, a commission spokesman said if the party re-registered in the near future, its candidates would be able to stand under the BNP banner at this May's local elections.  However, if they wish to stand before the registration is considered, BNP candidates will have to stand as independents.  Mr Squire suggested the party had too much to lose to let its registration lapse further.  "After battling for 30 years to get the debate on immigration going, we don't want to waste it on a technicality," he said.  Party names and identities are protected for two years under the 2000 Act to prevent other parties using them.  Nick Griffin stepped down as BNP leader in July 2014 after 15 years at the top. His decision came after he lost his seat in the European Parliament and the party saw its vote collapse in that year's local elections.  But months of infighting followed and Mr Griffin was expelled from the BNP amid accusations that he had tried to "destabilise" the party.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35263503	Tech giants raise concerns over UK draft surveillance bill	Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Twitter and Yahoo have expressed concerns to the UK Parliament over the draft Investigatory Powers Bill (IP Bill).  The firms are worried about the phrasing of proposals on encryption, bulk collection of data and openness.  The submission joins another, from Apple, which challenges the reach of the draft legislation.  If passed, the IP Bill would overhaul rules on how authorities access people's communications.  The five firms form part of a coalition called Reform Government Surveillance (RGS) which aims to promote a series of principles on how governments should collect communications data on their citizens.  "There are many aspects of the Bill which we believe remain opaque," the RGS companies state in their written evidence, citing the wording on judicial authorisation, encryption and technical requirements on tech firms among other things.  Their comments come in the form of written evidence submitted to a parliamentary committee considering the scope of the bill.  Currently, several of the corporations involved are standing by the provision of end-to-end encryption in some of their products - such as Apple's iPhones.  This allows people to communicate privately in a form that cannot be decoded, even by the company which makes the device.  The IP Bill would not outlaw encryption, but it would strengthen the power to force firms to give up decryption keys so that coded messages might be read.  On this issue, the tech firms rally behind comments made to the committee by Apple.  "We reject any proposals that would require companies to deliberately weaken the security of their products via backdoors, forced decryption, or any other means," the companies say.  There has been some question over whether companies could or should be compelled to insert "back doors" in their software - allowing intelligence agencies to access data which they transmit or store.  One key issue raised is that of extraterritorial jurisdiction - the extent to which UK authorities can compel foreign companies to comply with their laws.  "We have collective experience around the world of personnel who have nothing to do with the data sought being arrested or intimidated in an attempt to force an overseas corporation to disclose user information," state the RGS firms in their written evidence.  "We do not believe that the UK wants to legitimise this lawless and heavy-handed practice."  The submission notes that other countries around the world are likely to be influenced by what sort of laws are laid down in the UK and warns against "an increasingly chaotic international legal system".  There is also a comment on how surveillance might be made more transparent.  "As a general rule, users should be informed when the government seeks access to account data," the companies say.  "It is important both in terms of transparency, as well as affording users the right to protect their own legal rights."  If it is deemed necessary to delay notice in exceptional cases, the firms argue that the burden should be on the government to show that there is an overriding public safety case for doing so.  "I think it's very interesting how strongly the 'big players' of the internet have responded to the UK government's surveillance plans," said Paul Bernal, a legal expert at the University of East Anglia who also submitted evidence to the committee.  "The breadth of the intervention is remarkable - they haven't kept to purely technical matters, but talk about judicial authorisation, transparency and so forth," he told the BBC.  "This breadth shows how seriously they are taking the issue."  Dr Bernal also pointed out that the firms had raised the issue of "technical impositions" - the requirements that would be placed on communications companies by the bill should it become law.  Vodafone, in a separate submission, also commented on the obligation to obtain and generate data, saying: "There is nothing within the draft bill to indicate what this might mean, and could be used to require an operator to make changes to its networks and services simply to get more data — even relating to other companies' services — and to hold on to it for law enforcement."  Alongside the silicon valley firms expressing some anxiety over the draft IP Bill is the UK's own Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).  In an 11-page submission to the parliamentary committee, the ICO praises some of the bill's proposals while questioning the reach of others, including the retention of internet connection records (ICRs).  ICRs are the domain names of websites visited by internet users, but not records of specific pages.  "Although these are portrayed as conveying limited information about an individual they can, in reality, go much further and can reveal a great deal about the behaviours and activities of an individual," the ICO says.  Among other concerns, the ICO also highlights a clause in the draft bill which enables the secretary of state to force the removal of electronic protections on communications data.  The consequences of this clause could be "far-reaching" and have "detrimental consequences to the security of data", the ICO warns.  "The Information Commissioner's comments will carry particular weight since he is a government-appointed official whose job it is to protect the public's information," commented the BBC's security correspondent, Gordon Corera.  "His concerns echo some of those of the tech companies that some of the language in the act - for instance on encryption and equipment interference - is unclear and could have a real impact on the security and privacy of individuals' data."	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35261971	Osborne should face questions into shelved bank probe says MP	George Osborne should face questions from MPs as part of an inquiry into why a probe into the culture of banks was abandoned, Labour's John Mann has said.  The Treasury Select Committee is to question executives from the Financial Conduct Authority about their decision to drop a probe into pay and standards.  The chancellor says he had no knowledge of the "independent" decision.  But Mr Mann, a committee member, said this was a "bit weaselly", suggesting the FCA had been "told what to do".  The FCA had planned to look at whether pay, promotion or other incentives had contributed to scandals involving banks in the UK and abroad.  But, at the end of December, it said it had decided a "traditional thematic review" would not help it achieve its "desired outcomes", promising instead to encourage the "delivery of cultural change".  The cross-party committee of MPs has called the FCA's acting chief executive Tracey McDermott and its chairman John Griffith-Jones to appear before them later this month to explain the background to the decision.  "The FCA's decision to drop its review of bank culture does seem curious," said Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, who chairs the committee. "The decision to undertake this review was, after all, part of the FCA's business plan for 2015.  "It is not the dropping of the review that is crucial. What matters is the full implementation of the reforms recommended by the Vickers and Banking Commissions and set out to improve conduct in banks."  Mr Mann, the most senior Labour member on the committee, said he believed the Treasury not only knew what was going on but had been directly involved in the decision.  "It's my belief that the government has interfered," he told the Daily Politics.  "I think our inquiry will prove that, hopefully prove precisely how they've interfered. The FCA hasn't reached its own conclusions, it's been told what to do - it's been told via the Treasury."  The Labour MP said Mr Osborne, with whom he has frequently clashed at committee hearings, wanted to "neuter" the FCA and parachute "one of his senior officials" in to run the watchdog.  The FCA is searching for a new chief executive after Martin Wheatley's departure in the autumn. Mr Wheatley, who helped set up the regulator and was perceived as being tough on the banks, had been told that his contract would not be renewed.  Ms McDermott has withdrawn her name from consideration to succeed Mr Wheatley on a permanent basis, prompting claims by the opposition that the regulator - which replaced the Financial Services Authority in 2013 - is "rudderless".  The Treasury has strongly rejected any suggestions that it was aware of or behind the FCA's decision.  Speaking on Thursday, Mr Osborne said the scrapping of the inquiry was "a completely independent decision that I had no fore-knowledge of".  He suggested that the work the inquiry was due to undertake had already been completed by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, which reported in 2013 and the FCA needed new leadership "to take it into its more mature phase".	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35261968	Nigel Farage urges 'mass protest' at alcohol guidelines	UKIP leader Nigel Farage has urged a "mass protest" at new alcohol guidelines in the UK, which he says are a "form of nannying".  Recommended weekly alcohol limits have been substantially reduced and health officials now say there is no such thing as a safe level of drinking.  Mr Farage conceded there was a problem with a "binge drinking mentality".  But he said people should be able to enjoy a drink or two whether "it slightly shortens our lives or not".  Mr Farage has traded on his "man in the pub" reputation during his political career, frequently being pictured with a pint in his hand during campaigning or after election victories and describing every pub as a Parliament where political views are formed and exchanged.  The UKIP leader told LBC Radio that he was dismayed by the new guidelines, joking that he was now "25% more likely to die" than before.  Following its first full review of alcohol guidelines since 1995, the government now says men and women who drink regularly should consume no more than 14 units a week - equivalent to six pints of beer or seven glasses of wine.  The previous guidance set out daily drinking limits of three to four units for men and two to three for women. The UK's chief medical officers say new research shows any amount of alcohol can increase the risk of cancer.  Mr Farage said he was upset "to turn on the news this morning and hear some appalling puritanical figure telling us no level of drinking is safe".  "I think what we ought to do is have a mass protest against this form of nannying and we should all come out at lunch and have a glass of something."  The UKIP leader acknowledged there was a problem was excessive alcohol consumption in the UK but people should be trusted to know their limits.  "Even intelligent youngsters go out on a Friday night with the intention of getting hammered, we know that. But, frankly, if we choose to enjoy a few drinks four or five nights a week after a hard day at work whether it slightly shortens our lives or not, so what.  "Do what you enjoy - and I think to basically tell us that any form of drinking is likely to lead to our death is just so over the top that we will probably behave in the opposite way. I certainly will at midday today."  The new guidance suggests that if people drink, it should be moderately over three or more days and that some days should be alcohol-free. People should not "save up" their units and drink them all in one or two goes while pregnant women should not drink at all.  How the advice has changed  Previous government guidance set out daily drinking limits of three to four units for men and two to three for women. The new guidance moves to weekly limits to get away from the idea that drinking every day is fine.  The new 14 units limit therefore represents a cut in drinking levels for both men and women, although since 1995 doctors' groups have been advising that over the course of a week men should limit themselves to 21 units and women 14 units - the lower end of the daily range the government has been advising. So in effect the government guidance has caught up with the medical advice - and gone a bit further.  On drinking in pregnancy, the new advice is unambiguous. Women should not drink. Previously women in Wales, Northern Ireland and England had been told not to drink but if they did to limit it.  The latest guidance makes it clear people should be teetotal on some days and that heavy drinking sessions should be avoided. The 1995 did not set this out categorically.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35259579	CES 2016: Hoverboard booth raided following patent complaint	US marshals have raided a Chinese hoverboard-maker's stand at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.  The officials confiscated all the company's one-wheeled vehicles and took down its signs after a Silicon Valley-based rival filed a patent infringement claim.  The case is set to return to court in a week's time.  The Chinese firm, Changzhou First International Trade, told the BBC it did not believe it had broken the law.  It claimed it had developed its hoverboard a long time ago and had hidden it until now to avoid it being copied by other Chinese firms. It added that this was the first time it had been involved in such an incident.  A spokeswoman for the US Department of Justice told the BBC: "A court order has been served in a civil case involving private litigation."  She added that while it was not uncommon for the US marshals to be involved in such action, she could not recall another case happening at a trade show.  Footage of the incident has been posted online by the news agency Bloomberg.  While there are many companies exhibiting hoverboards at CES, the Chinese firm's models - which it calls Surfing Electric Scooters - were unusual for having a single central wheel rather than one at each end.  This is similar to California-based Future Motion's Onewheel vehicle, which uses sensors and computer controls to keep the board balanced.  "We have design and utility patents that cover our invention," Future Motion's founder Kyle Doerksen told the BBC.  "When we got word that a company was exhibiting a knock-off product, we engaged in the formal process, which involved sending a cease and desist letter and then getting a restraining order, which was then enforced by the US marshals.  "As a company that launched ourselves at CES two years ago, we know that the world is watching.  "And we knew that this was a situation where they could do real damage to our business if we just allowed them to violate our patents."  Changzhou currently lists its device for $550 (£375) on the Alibaba shopping site, which is about a third of the price of the Onewheel.  There are two patents involved in the case:  "Punitive measures could include a permanent injunction preventing Changzhou from selling the product in the US, monetary damages including lost profits we can prove due to infringing sales, and even attorney's fees if the court decides it's an exceptionally egregious case of wilful patent infringement," said Future Motion's lawyer Shawn Kolitch.  He added that Future Motion had patents pending elsewhere including in China, which it hoped to obtain in order to stop Changzhou manufacturing the device.  This is not the first controversy hoverboards have faced at CES.  Ahead of the event starting, its organiser announced that attendees were banned from using any type of the vehicles to get about its showfloors.  Dozens of universities and other institutions in the US had earlier banned their use and most of the country's airlines have also refused to carry them.  They have been involved in incidents where people have been injured or killed when the rider lost control.

Holosonics says its sound-beaming technology means someone could also watch TV in bed without keeping their partner awake as only the watcher need hear the audio.  The catch is that it costs about $1,000 (£685), making it an expensive alternative to a pair of headphones.  The business was founded Joseph Pompei, a graduate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who explained how it worked at the Las Vegas show.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35258674	CES 2016: The toilet you only clean once a year	An "intelligent" toilet that opens when you approach it and self-cleans with every flush is on display at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas.  It also cleans the user with an aerated wand, which delivers warm water and warm air "from a seated position", a spokeswoman said.  Despite a $9,800 (£6,704) price tag, more than 40 million earlier versions of the Neorest toilets have been sold.  Bathroom firm Toto said the new prototype was still in development.  Its self-cleaning process uses a combination of a disinfectant and a glaze - made out of zirconium and titanium dioxide - which coats the bowl.  "Once it flushes it sprays the interior of the bowl with electrolysed water," explained Toto spokeswoman Lenora Campos.  "That's regular tap water we run through a proprietary process that uses an anodic cathode to create what is essentially a weak bleach, and it bleaches the interior, killing anything in the bowl."  Meanwhile an ultraviolet light in the lid charges the surface.  That makes it super-hydrophilic - or water-loving, so nothing can stick to it - and also photocatalytic, enabling oxygen ions to break down bacteria and viruses.  "You don't have to clean the toilet bowl for over a year," said Ms Campos.  The BBC asked several of Las Vegas' hotels if they might be interested in such a product, but all declined to comment.  However, one smart home expert said the device proved there was still space for innovation beyond hooking things up to the internet.  "It illustrates the notion that tech breakthroughs involve rethinking things," said Frank Gillett from the tech consultancy Forrester Research.  "It's not necessarily about adding anything new."  Potential purchasers should be warned, however, that the device does not totally absolve them of toilet cleaning duties since its cleansing techniques do not extend to spills outside of the bowl.	tech

This week though, the crowdfunding site Indiegogo formally announced its intention to work more closely with the world's biggest corporations.  The firm said it wanted to help them crowdfund their own research ideas and get customers to vote with their wallets on which to develop by pledging cash to back their favourites.  While Indiegogo will hope the move proves lucrative, one expert warned that it also risked crowding out entrepreneurs.  And other people have speculated that few people would be interested in funding projects on behalf of multi-billion pound companies.  Indiegogo said that firms would be able to ask its users to suggest ideas for which it could then seek financial backing and input from potential customers. They could also put out their own projects to gauge the potential market and attract funding and would receive promotional and strategic support from Indiegogo staff, it said.  The firm said the programme was open only to Fortune 1000 and Global 500 companies. While it has said that the prices it planned to charge would be prohibitive to smaller firms, it declined to elaborate on Thursday, beyond saying that fees would "vary based on what the client is looking to accomplish".  An Indiegogo spokeswoman said the site's users, who she described as tending to be "early adopters" of new technology, would be attracted by the same things that draw them to start-up projects on the site - getting their hands on the products early, as well as "other perks".  When it officially launched Enterprise Crowdfunding on Wednesday, Indiegogo chose to highlight four firms that have used it so far: General Electric's FirstBuild, the toy firm Hasbro, the Anheuser-Busch-owned Shock Top and Harman International Industries.  Each campaign was trumpeted as a success story. The firms - or their parent companies - made combined profits of more than $27bn (£18.6bn) in the latest year for which they have produced accounts.  Some reports have expressed scepticism that the promise of earlier delivery would be enough to convince Indiegogo users to back such well-funded corporations.  Indiegogo said its site was a "reward-based crowdfunding platform", meaning that its users expected to receive an "item or service in return for their contribution", as opposed to a return on an investment.  "As you can see by the success of campaigns like the ones by GE or Hasbro, the Indiegogo crowd is willing to get involved, they are early adopters and they want to be involved in the decision-making process and have access to innovative products or services first hand," its spokeswoman said.  And Slava Rubin, its founder and chief executive, said the site was created for anyone "from the inventor working out of her garage to the largest Fortune 500 companies".  Nevertheless, the issue has been raised before. The actor and filmmaker Zach Braff was criticised when he began crowdfunded his new film on Kickstater in 2013.  Many people expressed anger that someone who was perceived as not needing the money was asking people to fund his work. Despite that, Wish I Was Here was backed to the tune of more than $3m (£2.05m) by more than 46,000 people.  According to Duncan McCann, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, the greatest risk was that entrepreneurs who rely on sites like Indiegogo would be crowded out.  While he was not surprised that large firms might seek to offload some of the costs of research and development, he said that the effect would be minimal. "Even if they got tens of thousands of people paying, it is not going to cover those costs. It is about understanding the market very quickly, which is a real benefit. It also brings a guarantee of a certain number of purchases and it generates loyalty."  He added: "What you get is the established players moving in once people are comfortable with the concept. It will be interesting to see how it plays out. Will we see people going to other platforms?  "My worry is not so much that big players have a way of doing something smarter, my problem would be if it pushed out the real entrepreneurs, who will be the real future engines of the economy.  "Customer loyalty is also disappearing, so engaging people with products is a really big benefit. The big companies really cannot lose."	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35255732	CES 2016: 'PayPal' of smart devices puts users in control	An Israeli company that uses machine learning to create a digital identity map of individuals is showcasing its technology at the CES tech show .  I caught up with the man behind it in a quiet area away from the show floor.  Gilad Meiri's demo was both terrifying and enlightening.  It is something his company, Neura, normally only shows internally to its employees.  But it's something that would be food for thought for the many companies showcasing their so-called smart gadgets at the Vegas show.  His firm has created smartphone software that sucks in data from many of the apps a person uses as well as their location data.  "You should be scared," he told me. "It is a radical view of privacy".  The screen he showed me displayed a week in the life of Neura employee Andrew - detailing all of his movements and activities via the myriad of devices - phones, tablets and activity trackers - that we all increasingly carry with us.  It also showed all his interactions with others via his smart devices.  "This is a map of your life, it shows what places are important to you. It is the holy grail of the internet of things," said Mr Meiri.  It should be noted that Andrew consented to Neura tracking his activities - but I can't show the map of his digital identity in this article, for privacy reasons.  Neura gathers all this data in order to automatically provide notifications that it thinks will help its owner over the course of the day.  But the firm's ultimate goal is to offer its service to other apps, and act as a single secure channel for all of a user's personal data rather than having it handled by multiple parties, as is currently the case.  Neura aims to offer an alternative model to companies like Google, which already gather lots of data about their users.  The search firm relies on having access to information about people's web-browsing habits to make money. It has also moved into connected devices via its smart home division Nest, although it says it does not mix the two sets of data.  While Mr Meiri says that Neura's technology could be combined with Google's he adds he has no intention of forming a partnership with the US giant.  "Google takes data and serves ads, and in response you get a free service," Mr Meiri said.  "Our model is radically different - we take your data, transform it into knowledge that you can sell back to companies.  "We are like PayPal for the internet of things.  "We facilitate transactions, and our currency is your digital identity.  "It is a spy technology, but it is powered by trust."  So, why would a consumer want to share such sensitive data?  It would, Mr Meiri said, allow smart devices to become truly smart.  "The fact that an oven is connected to the internet is not smart - but an oven that knows when you have left the house and left the oven on, that is.  "It is about devices understanding you."  While companies making smart devices already have valuable data on customers, there are also dozens of different protocols for how devices talk to each other, making the burgeoning industry something of a Wild West, according to experts.  "This year's CES underlines the desperate levels of fragmentation and confusion in connected-home solutions," said Ben Wood, of research company CCS Insight.  The numerous gadgets on show that supported Google's Nest, Amazon's Echo and Apple's HomeKit risked "consumers sleepwalking into a connected home experience curated by technology giants", he added.  Neura is hoping to change that.  "With the internet, we have lost the battle to control our data, so changing the data economy for the internet of things, opposing the Google model is worth a shot," Mr Meiri said.  "Users can own their data, they can win."  Read more of our CES articles and follow the BBC team covering the show on Twitter.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35258180	Bill Clinton on Tony Blair's 'choirboy' look	Bill Clinton told Tony Blair he had "that choirboy look" - and offered to babysit for his children when he left office, newly released records show.  Transcripts of candid conversations between the former US president and the ex-UK prime minister have been published following a BBC FOI request.  They start with Mr Clinton congratulating Mr Blair on his 1997 general election victory.  Soon afterwards, Mr Blair is already targeting a second term in office.  "We are having a hell of a time getting under way - the honeymoon doesn't last long," he said as Mr Clinton attended a meeting of his new Cabinet.  "The second term is what we need; to take nothing for granted and not rely on the other side's unpopularity."  In a conversation straight after Labour's election victory, Mr Clinton commiserates with Mr Blair for "getting so much grief with the press".  "Always the Right attack you and the Left don't defend you," Mr Blair replies.  The transcripts of calls and meetings between the two leaders also cover the Northern Ireland peace process and the death of Princess Diana, as documented in a blog by BBC Freedom of Information specialist Martin Rosenbaum.  They have been released by the Clinton Presidential Library, which stores the records of his presidency.  In one conversation, Mr Clinton praises Gordon Brown, then Mr Blair's chancellor, at a meeting of international finance ministers.  "He was terrific, you would have been really proud of him," he says.  When the US president speaks of his affection for Durham Cathedral, Mr Blair says: "I was a choirboy at the cathedral in Durham, if you can believe that."  "You still have that choirboy look," replies Mr Clinton.  Towards the end of the exchanges, in 2000, Mr Blair is preparing for the birth of his fourth child. and Mr Clinton is soon to leave office.  "You know, after January I'm available for babysitting duties," he says.  "I wouldn't say that or you'll be doing it," Mr Blair replies.  "You said you wanted to continue my work with the Third Way," Mr Clinton says, "and this is it: helping Blair balance life and family".	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35249271	CES: Five smart gadgets for all the family	Everything these days is prefixed with the word "smart" and nowhere is that more in evidence than at CES .  One manufacturer is even offering a smart water bottle. Lifefuels won an award at the tech show for the bottle with "five interchangeable "fuelpods" filled with vitamins, nutritional products and flavours, allowing users to tailor their water to suit their specific lifestyles".  Why anyone would need such a product is open to debate but it does raise the question about what "smart" really means.  For many firms, a so-called smart device is just something connected to the internet but Adam Simon, an analyst with research firm Context, thinks it should be about more.  "The real question is - what can you do with it? What is it actually doing to help you in your life?"  A Context study found most European home-owners are still reluctant to invest in smart tech - 19% of Britons said that they would buy one smart gadget in the next year and, even then, it would have to cost no more than £150.  The BBC has been looking at some of the smart tech on offer for the family home at CES.  This may just be the craziest thing to come out of CES but it was taken seriously enough by a panel of expert judges to win the CES Launchit ShowStoppers award.  Described by founder Leo Trottier as a games console for dogs, the Cleverpet gadget consists of three flashing lights and a treat dispenser. The dog has to press the lights in the right combination in order to win the treat.  It also has a microphone and speaker so that pet owners can task their dogs with more complex games - such as touching a particular colour or combination of lights.  "A dog with a job is a happy dog," said Mr Trottier as part of his pitch to the judges. "And my user-base quite literally has nothing else to do."  He knows a thing or two about training animals - he told the BBC that he taught his cat to use the toilet.  More seriously, there are hundreds of pets left home alone each day and Mr Trottier is keen to find a solution to the suggestion that many of these animals are bored. He believes that some dogs will learn to advance to complex levels.  There is some serious science behind the design - one member of the team is a neuroscientist who has spent years teaching grammar to birds - and Mr Trottier himself is a cognitive scientist.  A little black and white dog named Fiona demoed the system for me, but she could only handle the one button level as she has only been training for a week.  Ok, this falls very much into the same category as the smart water bottle as something that is only tenuously smart, and it costs more than £150 - retailing in the US for $400 - but, come on, it's a cocktail maker for your home.  Bartesian looks a lot like a capsule-based coffee maker and it is basically the alcoholic equivalent.  There are reservoirs for the spirits - vodka, rum, tequila and gin - and these must be supplied by the owner. The rest - including the liqueurs which are recreated using non-alcoholic flavours - comes in a capsule.  There are six on offer - including margarita, cosmopolitan and zest martini - and each comes with a barcode that is read by the machine making it.  The smart home survey from Context revealed that people regard their kitchen as the smartest room in the house, which is a strange choice given that most living rooms now boast a smart TV - but there are plenty of gadgets on show that aim to add to its smartness.  Whirlpool has a dishwasher that can be linked to a Nest thermostat, meaning it will run when energy costs are lowest.  And there has been quite a lot of buzz around an internet-connected washing machine which is also packed with sensors, designed by a firm called Marathon Laundry.  British firm Smarter, makers of the iKettle, has a range of products on show at CES that are considerably cheaper - all under £100.  They include a smart camera for the fridge which takes real-time photos of your food, and a smart mat for cupboards that reveals what ingredients are in there via an app on a smartphone.  We all probably use more water than we need so the idea of a shower that will flash when you have used too much is rather compelling.  French firm Start & Blue has developed Hydrao, a system that can be fitted to any shower and which flashes red once a 50 litre limit has passed.  The company has already sold around 1,000 units and claims that water use was reduced by an average of 25% when it was used.  This one's for the kids and could help parents with that perennial problem of getting them away from their screens.  Gemio, a venture-funded, Seattle-based firm, has set out to create a wearable for teenagers that it hopes will appeal to both their desire to express themselves and be sociable.  "The challenge with wearables is getting people to wear it beyond a few months," Gemio founder Michael Bettua told the BBC.  To counter that, the smart bracelets comes with 35 different designs which clip on and off. Wearers can also design their own.  They are also fitted with 22 LED lights which can be used to engage with friends who also own bracelets. The bracelet can flash up different light combinations that correlate to customised messages.  "It is a new form of social networking - kids can send secret messages to each other," said Mr Bettua.  The bracelet goes on sale in June at a price of $85.

Mr Cameron said it would be better not to have to resort to new taxes but said that "what matters is we do make progress" on obesity.  The PM was speaking to journalists following reports a tax on sugary drinks was being considered.  Number 10 previously said he "doesn't see a need for a tax on sugar".  In October a report by Public Health England recommended a tax of between 10 and 20% on high-sugar products as one of the measures needed to achieve a "meaningful" reduction in sugar consumption.  Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has also campaigned for such a move, while a new study in the British Medical Journal said Mexico's sugary drinks tax led to a 12% reduction in sales.  Asked at a press conference in Hungary whether he was ready to reverse his previous opposition to the policy, Mr Cameron said: "I don't really want to put new taxes onto anything but we do have to recognise that we face potentially in Britain something of an obesity crisis when we look at the effect of obesity on not just diabetes but the effect on heart disease, potentially on cancer."  The PM said the government would come up with a "fully worked-up programme" to tackle obesity, with details announced later this year.  He added: "We shouldn't be in the business of ruling things out but obviously putting extra taxes on things is not something I aim to do, it's something I would rather avoid."  A Downing Street spokeswoman said more needed to be done to reduce obesity and urged the food and drink industry to develop more alternative products that do not have high sugar levels.  The Food and Drink Federation has said it does not agree evidence supports the introduction of a tax on sugary products and that industry is "determined" to help tackle childhood obesity.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35251429	Dutch government says no to 'encryption backdoors'	The Netherlands has said it will not force tech firms to share encrypted communications such as emails with its security agencies.  The move puts the country in stark contrast with US and UK officials, who have argued agencies need such access to fight terrorism.  The Netherlands began reviewing its policies after the recent Paris terrorist attacks.  But this week it said "restrictive" measures would put citizens at risk.  Encryption is a way of protecting communications or data so that it is incomprehensible without the correct passcode or key.  Advocates say it protects users by preventing criminals and spies from prying into private conversations.  But security agencies have said they struggled to bypass encrypted messaging platforms used by groups such as so-called Islamic State to plan attacks.  "We are not some kind of maniacs who are ideologues against encryption," FBI director James Comey said in November:  "But we have a problem that encryption is crashing into public safety and we have to figure out, as people who care about both, how to resolve it."  In a letter published this week, the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice concluded there were arguments for and against "strong encryption".  However, it said allowing law enforcers to access protected data would make digital systems vulnerable to "criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services".  "This would have undesirable consequences for the security of information stored and communicated and the integrity of ICT systems, which are increasingly of importance for the functioning of the society," it added.  Despite objections from the FBI, the White House has dropped plans to force tech firms to share encrypted data.  But the UK government hopes to secure such powers through its Draft Investigatory Powers Bill - referred to by some as the Snooper's Charter.  The bill also includes a stipulation that internet and phone companies keep records of every website, app and service to which a computer connects.  The proposals have met with fierce resistance from privacy advocates and tech firms.  Some fear it will legitimise the mass surveillance programmes of the US and UK security agencies uncovered by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013.  In December, Apple told a parliamentary select committee scrutinising the bill that "in this rapidly evolving cyber-threat environment, companies should remain free to implement strong encryption to protect customers".  And this week, William Binney, ex-technical director of the US National Security Agency, said the bill would be "totalitarian" and "cost lives".  "It is 99% useless," he said in a letter sent to MPs.  "Who wants to know everyone who has ever looked at Google or the BBC? We have known for decades that that swamps [security agency] analysts."	tech

The former London Mayor told the BBC's Daily Politics Nato membership would be one of the issues his review would probably be looking at.  Labour put out a statement afterwards saying it was not part of the review.  Nato is a military alliance between the US and European nations founded in 1949 to counter any Soviet Union threat.  In his Daily Politics interview, Mr Livingstone questioned the 29 nation organisation's role in the modern world, saying: "My main view on this is that it doesn't really matter whether you're in Nato or not terribly much because the Cold War is over.  "If we're to stay in Nato, the question is what's its role? Invading more countries in the Middle East? I'm not in favour of that."  He denied he had already made up his mind about replacing Britain's Trident nuclear weapons, one of the main issues the review will be looking at.  He told the programme he could back Trident renewal if someone could persuade him it was vital for the UK's security.  But he said America and Russia had "vast arsenals" when it came to nuclear weapons while the UK and France were just "side shows".  He said it would be "suicide" to launch an attack on Russia, saying the UK only had "enough to start a war, not to win a war".  Conservative MP Julian Lewis, chairman of the defence select committee, said Mr Livingstone was wrong to call the UK a "side show" when it came to amount of nuclear weapons it possessed. He said "we can inflict unacceptable damage" on other countries.  He denied renewing Trident would make the UK part of the nuclear arms race, saying the UK had the minimum amount to protect its security.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35251484	Microsoft reveals details of Windows 10 usage tracking	Microsoft has revealed details about the data it is tracking via its new operating system (OS), Windows 10.  In a blog, the firm listed statistics on how many minutes had been spent by users in total in the Edge browser and the number of photographs which had been viewed in the Photo app.  The firm also said that Windows 10 was now active on over 200 million devices.  However, some people have questioned whether the data tracking is a threat to privacy.  Since Windows 10 was launched, Microsoft has been tracking information about how those with the OS are using it.  Until now though, relatively little has been known about what data is being collected.  Microsoft also reported that Windows 10 continued to be the fastest growing version of Windows, outpacing the adoption of both Windows 8 and Windows 7.  Security expert Prof Alan Woodward told the BBC he was interested to know the long-term plans for the data.  "[This information] might be collected for one purpose, but how long will it be stored for? What else are they going to use it for?" he said.  "As soon as it goes outside the EU it's no longer protected by things like the UK's Data Protection Act."  Recently, Microsoft announced it would be opening UK data centres for corporate clients in a move the firm hoped would address privacy watchdogs' concerns about "data sovereignty".  However, it is not clear where data relating to the company's own operating system is transmitted and stored.  When asked about this, a Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.  Prof Woodward also suggested that users of the new OS may not be fully aware of how comprehensively it is tracking their activity.  "I've noticed it because I've been installing it a lot recently. The default is for them to track a whole lot of things about usage and send details back to Microsoft," he said.  "I think some people are walking into it blindfolded, they don't necessarily realise what's going on."  A spokesman for Microsoft declined to comment on the issue but provided a link to a blog and a web page on Windows 10 and privacy.  The web page states that the data collection is intended to "make your device more personal and delightful to you".	tech

Mordor is the name of a fictional region nicknamed "Land of Shadow" in JRR Tolkien's Lord of the Rings books.  In addition, "Russians" was translated to "occupiers" and "Sergey Lavrov", the country's Foreign Minister, to "sad little horse".  The errors had been introduced to Google Translate's Ukrainian to Russian service automatically, Google said.  All three terms mirror language used by some Ukrainians following Moscow's annexation of Crimea in 2014.  Screenshots of the erroneous translations have appeared on social networks in recent days.  "Google Translate is an automatic translator - it works without the intervention of human translators, using technology instead," said Google in its statement.  The company added Google Translate worked by looking for patterns in hundreds of millions of documents but translation remained difficult as the meaning of words was tied to the context in which they were used.  "This means that not all translations are perfect, and there will sometimes be mistakes or mistranslations," the statement added.  "We always work to correct these as quickly as possible when they are brought to our attention."  Although translations are managed automatically, it is possible for users to suggest alternative translations manually.  However, the BBC understands that this was not how the errors were introduced.  The bug now appears to have been fixed.	tech

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35243407	where did it all go wrong?	During the 90s and early 2000s, Yahoo was a veritable web titan - a leader in email, online news and search.  But the internet media company's fortunes have changed drastically, with sales falling from $7.2bn (£5bn) in 2008 to $4.6bn (£3.1bn) last year.  This is partly because Google and Facebook have come to dominate the online advertising market from where Yahoo derives its revenue.  A series of chief executives has also failed to stem the decline.  This week, Reuters reported investors had called for Yahoo's core business to be sold after a slump in its share price.  Some said it could lead to the sacking of current chief executive Marissa Mayer and even the end of the Yahoo brand itself.  So where did it all go wrong for the firm and what lies ahead?  Founded in 1994 by Stanford University graduates Jerry Yang and David Filo, the firm swiftly grew to become one of the internet's first web portals, competing with the likes of MSN and Lycos.  "It was a one-stop shop bringing together news and other services for users lacking expertise in navigating the internet," said Richard Kramer, founder of Arete Research and a 20-year tech analyst.  The company also survived the dot com crash of 2000 and its sales climbed tenfold between 2001 and 2008.  However, Mr Kramer said that over time the concept of web portals had become "outmoded".  "In its main search and display ad businesses, Yahoo found itself being overtaken by rivals like Gmail and Hotmail or younger upstarts, messaging apps like Whatsapp or WeChat," he said.  "News aggregation came from Facebook, Twitter and new digital channels like Huffington Post or Vice."  He added: "Yahoo also fell behind the curve in search - partnering with Microsoft, which had tried to buy it - while it was slow to scale up in video and mobile."  The problem was Yahoo generated most of its revenue by selling advertising space on such platforms - and as its audience drifted to other sites, its sales faltered.  Highlighting the discord, chief executive Mr Yang stepped down in December 2008 and the firm laid off 7% of its workforce a month later.  The company needed to reinvent itself - but even Mr Yang's replacement, Carole Bartz, admitted she had struggled with the question of what Yahoo is when she took over in 2009.  "We're not a search company. We're not a display [advertising] company. We're a broad-based internet technology company that serves up the most interesting content on the internet to 600 million people," she later said.  Mr Kramer said the high level of the churn at the top at the firm did not help either.  Ms Bartz soon lost her job in September 2011 and her replacement, Scott Thompson, only lasted four months before resigning over claims he falsified his resumé.  "They went through an endless succession of management changes at a time when they really needed to steady the ship," Mr Kramer said.  "They were also besieged by activist investors calling for change, continuing the cycle of management churn."  Ms Mayer, who has been in situ since July 2012, now faces a similar revolt.  She has tried to bolster Yahoo by acquiring firms such as Flurry, a mobile analytics service, and Tumblr, the blogging service.  But its core internet business continues to lose money. In fact, most of the internet company's $33bn (£21.8bn) value is attributed to its shareholding in Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant.  After reversing a plan to sell the stake, Ms Mayer has adopted a strategy to spin off the core business into a new company  But on Monday, Reuters reported several major Yahoo shareholders wanted Ms Mayer to sell the core business outright.  A source said she had the support of her board, but multiple investors have called for her resignation.  Mr Kramer says the choice is a simple one: "Either the CEO needs to put herself out of a job by selling the business, or be given room to pursue a fresh strategy, with restructuring already promised to be announced with the 2015 results."  He added: "The media likes to say Yahoo is a turnaround, but that's the wrong way to think about it.  "It really needs to grow - or buy - entirely new businesses to bolt on to its existing franchise, to attract new audiences.  "This is what Mayer is a trying to do, even if the execution of the plans has been poor."	tech

The prime minister said his renegotiation was dealing with serious issues, adding that Britain did not want to be part of ever-closer union and should not be called upon to financially support the euro.  Speaking from Upper Bavaria in Germany, Mr Cameron said reform was "vital" as Britain had "real issues" with the European Union.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35247318	CES 2016: Desktop 3D printer uses paper, glue and razors	A desktop 3D printer that uses paper, ink and glue to create highly detailed objects has been unveiled at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.  Mcor said it was the first time such technology had become available in a machine suitable for classrooms and offices.  The device is one of many new 3D printers to have been announced.  Other launches include a sub-£200 ($300) model and a machine that creates circuit boards.  There is still uncertainty about the sector as a whole. Share prices in many of the firms involved sank in 2015 over concerns the industry had been over-hyped.  But shipments are still forecast to rise from about 244,000 devices in 2015 to 2.4 million units in 2018, according to research firm Gartner.  The Mcor Arke creates colour models at a resolution of 4,800 by 2,400 dots per inch, providing higher detail than many 2D printers.  It does this by using razors to cut plain paper into shape, inkjets to colour it and then glue to join all the layers together and to laminate the final object.  The firm believes its use of normal paper gives it an edge over rivals.  "Because paper is used with other non-toxic materials, no special ventilation or disposal systems are needed, just an ordinary recycle bin [and none of] the messy powders or melting plastics used by other 3D printers," it said.  The machine - which is targeted at schools and offices - is due to go on sale before July and will cost $5,995. That is about half the price that Mcor had been charging for a much bulkier model.  "Nobody can match Mcor's resolution in terms of colour," said Daniel O'Connor from TCT magazine.  "This printer's resolution is twice that of any industrial machine, and those industrial machines typically cost over $50,000."  Taiwan's XYZprinting is hoping to succeed by selling a model for just $269.  The Da Vinci Mini makes objects by squirting hot plastic to build them up layer by layer, a basic technique that means creations can look a bit rough and ready.  But the company suggests it could serve as a starter device.  "Making 3D printing technology affordable and accessible has always been XYZprinting's biggest goal so that we can break down the barriers to ownership," the firm's chief executive Simon Shen told the BBC.  "There are other obstacles apart from price, such as speed and multiple colours, but it's just a matter of time [before] every home and office has at least one 3D printer."  Mr O'Connor said it was significant that an established brand was now offering a 3D printer for less than a games console.  "The machines XYZprinting are producing may not be the highest quality in the world, but they more than fill the void for what people want for schools and other educational purposes," he said.  There is also much higher-end gear at CES.  3D Systems has a model that can print complex objects out of titanium, stainless steel and nickel.  The ProX DMP 320 is targeted at the aerospace and automotive industries and costs up to $700,000.  Nano Dimension, an Israeli start-up, is demoing a printer that uses inks containing nanoparticles of silver to create complex circuit boards.  It says the Dragonfly 2020 can help gadget-makers bring products to market more quickly by making it easier to test the electronics involved.  Makerbot - one of the biggest 3D printing brands - is also in attendance.  Its latest product, the Smart Extruder+, may not seem as eye-catching as those of its rivals, but it marks an important moment for the business.  The $199 device allows users to upgrade the part of their machine that melts plastic and pushes it through a nozzle to build up an object.  It includes a sensor that can pause the printing process if it detects the plastic has got jammed or run out, and sends an alert to its user's smartphone.  The component is itself a replacement for an original version, launched in 2014, which customers complained had a tendency to fail sooner than expected.  Last year, a class action lawsuit was filed over the matter that claimed the firm had knowingly sold a product it knew had problems.  Affected owners were particularly annoyed that Makerbot had only offered a 90-day warranty for the device. That has been extended to six months for the Smart Extruder+.  "Makerbot had pretty bad publicity over the original one," said Mr O'Connor.  "It really needs to focus now on improving its technology and making it work rather than launching fancy new machines, and I think that's what it is doing now."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35239232	Labour reshuffle: Shadow ministers quit in protest	Three Labour MPs have quit the party's front bench in protest at sackings made by Jeremy Corbyn in his reshuffle.  Jonathan Reynolds and Stephen Doughty quit over the sacking of the shadow Europe minister Pat McFadden.  Mr Corbyn fired Mr McFadden over "disloyalty" after he appeared to criticise his stance on terrorism.  Kevan Jones has quit his defence role over Trident after Mr Corbyn replaced pro-nuclear weapons MP Maria Eagle with unilateralist Emily Thornberry.  Shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn - who also disagrees with Mr Corbyn on key issues including bombing IS targets in Syria - escaped the axe in the shake-up.  He denied he had been "muzzled" by Mr Corbyn after reportedly agreeing not to criticise the leader's policy positions from the front bench, saying he would be carrying on with his job "exactly as before".  The only changes in the shadow cabinet see anti-Trident MP Emily Thornberry replacing shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle, who moves to culture to replace sacked Michael Dugher.  But the moves have sparked a string of departures in the junior ranks.  In his resignation letter, Mr Reynolds backed comments by Mr McFadden in the aftermath of the Paris terror attacks, in which he criticised the response of the Stop the War coalition, which Mr Corbyn used to chair.  Mr McFadden said Mr Corbyn had told him he thought his comments were "an attack on him and that he had come to the conclusion because of that and one or two other things that I shouldn't continue".  "He clearly feels that me saying terrorists are entirely responsible for their action, that no-one forces anyone to kill innocent people in Paris, to blow up the London Underground, to behead innocent aid workers, that when I say they are entirely responsible for that, he clearly interpreted that as an attack on him," he added.  Shadow foreign minister Stephen Doughty - who announced his resignation on the BBC's Daily Politics - said Mr McFadden had been "singled out for punishment for speaking with honesty and principle".  MPs Wes Streeting, John Woodcock and Jamie Reed were among others to criticise Mr McFadden's sacking on Twitter.  John McDonnell suggested in a BBC News Channel interview that Hilary Benn could emulate himself and Mr Corbyn, who spent their lengthy careers to this point speaking from the back benches, often against their party leader.  Not to be uncharitable to the pair, but hardly anyone in the media was interested when they did it. But if a senior figure like Mr Benn did it, it would almost certainly become the story. Conservative MPs would be beside themselves with glee.  Kevan Jones who last year clashed with Ken Livingstone, when the anti-nuclear former mayor was put in joint charge of Labour's defence review, said he "respected" Mr Corbyn's view that Britain's nuclear deterrent should be scrapped, but disagreed and could no longer remain as shadow defence minister.  He described Ms Thornberry's appointment as a mistake, saying it left the party's defence policy "controlled by the North London Labour party".  But Ms Thornberry, the MP for Islington South, defended her suitability for the role and promised that, while she had clear personal views on Trident, she would lead a "truly open review" on the UK's nuclear deterrent.  In an interview with the British Forces Broadcasting Service, she said she had "quite a lot more experience" than people were giving her credit for, pointing out she had family members in the military and a "regiment in my constituency".  Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell defended the decision to sack Mr McFadden, saying there had been other "issues about loyalty" and it was not just about one Commons statement.  He told the Today programme Mr McFadden's comments had "played into an agenda which distorted Jeremy's views on how we tackle terrorism" and this had contributed to the "undermining of Jeremy's status".  Later he told Channel 4 News there was a "hard right" faction in the party which had never accepted Mr Corbyn's election victory.  At Prime Minster's Questions, David Cameron said it "speaks volumes" about Mr Corbyn's leadership that Mr McFadden should be sacked for saying terrorists should be held responsible for their actions and he questioned why Mr Benn had not quit the front bench team.  He then poked fun at Labour through the medium of Shakespeare quotes.  Responding to a question from Stratford-on-Avon Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi, he said: "There was a moment when it looked like this reshuffle could go into its Twelfth Night. It was a revenge reshuffle so it was going to be As You Like It.  "I think though we can conclude it's turned into something of a Comedy Of Errors, perhaps Much Ado About Nothing? There will be those who worry Love's Labour's Lost."  The Conservatives said Labour was now a "threat to national security", citing Ms Thornberry's views on Trident and comments Mr Corbyn has made in the past about Nato and the role of the UK armed forces.  Mr McFadden is being replaced by former junior shadow education minister, Pat Glass.  There are now 17 women and 14 men in the full shadow cabinet. Elsewhere, Emma Lewell-Buck was promoted to shadow minister for devolution and local government.  Responding to comments by Labour leadership sources that he was sacked for "incompetence and disloyalty", sacked shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher tweeted that he was "not sure it's sensible for the leader and his office to get into a debate about 'loyalty' or 'competence'".  Confirming his own dismissal earlier on Tuesday, Mr Dugher - a former aide to Gordon Brown - said he had "paid the price" for speaking out in defence of colleagues whose reputations he claimed had been "trashed" by aides to Mr Corbyn.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35244484	PMQs: Corbyn clashes with Cameron over flood defences	Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has clashed with the prime minister over funding for flood defence schemes.  Mr Corbyn attacked Mr Cameron's government for cancelling a scheme in Leeds and turning down applications to improve protection in York and Cumbria.  But Mr Cameron said flood relief had improved and spending on protection had increased to £2bn in England.  He said it was "laughable" to suggest Mr Corbyn would have responded to the Christmas floods more quickly.  December was the wettest month on record in the UK, with about 16,000 homes in England flooded, and Cumbria, Lancashire and Yorkshire among the worst affected.  Parts of Northern Ireland, Wales, and Scotland also saw flooding and damage from a series of storms, including Desmond, Eva and Frank.  More heavy rain is expected overnight and on Thursday and could cause further flooding, the Environment Agency for England and Wales is warning.  It comes as MPs on the Commons Environment Committee were told by Environment Agency bosses that flood defences saved lives and did not fail during December's storms.  Mr Corbyn questioned whether the government had learnt from flooding in January 2014.  Mr Cameron said "a number of lessons have been learnt", adding: "This time the military came in far faster than ever before, the Bellwin Scheme [financial assistance scheme] was funded at 100% not 85%, more money got to communities more quickly."  He said there was "always" more to learn, adding: "That is why we will review everything that's been done. But let's be clear as we do that that we will make money available."  Mr Corbyn attacked the government for cancelling funding for flood protection schemes.  "One thousand homes and businesses in Leeds were flooded in recent weeks [and] the government is still only committed to a scaled-down version of the project worth a fraction of its total cost - when the prime minister claimed that money was no object when it came to flood relief," said the Labour leader.  He pressed the prime minister to guarantee full funding for a £190m project on the River Aire in Leeds that was cancelled in 2011.  And he called for a cross-party approach which would back "properly funded" flood protection schemes and upland management to make homes more resilient.  Mr Cameron said: "We are spending more on flood defence schemes and are stacking up a whole series of schemes that we'll spend more on...  "If you are going to spend billions of pounds on renationalising our railways, where are you going to find the money for flood defences?  "The idea that this individual would be faster in responding to floods when it takes him three days to carry out a [shadow cabinet] reshuffle is frankly laughable."  The Labour leader later wrote to David Cameron to seek further assurances on funding for key schemes.  In the letter, Mr Corbyn claimed Mr Cameron's remarks during Prime Minister's Questions had been "simply disingenuous" and to assert more was being spent than five years ago was a "misrepresentation" of the facts.  "As we face billions of pounds worth of flood damage, we can now tangibly see the effects of the false economy that is your government's austerity," Mr Corbyn wrote.  Over the current parliament, £2.3bn will be spent on flood defences in England.  Last year £802m was spent on flood defences, according to Defra, but the amount spent in 2015-16 is expected to decrease to £695m.  In Cumbria, £45m was spent by the government on flood defences during the last parliament, Environment secretary Liz Truss has said. A new £4.4m flood defence scheme was constructed in Cumbria in 2013, which included the UK's first "self-closing" flood barriers.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35247721	Emily Thornberry donation questions dismissed as 'smears'	Friends of Emily Thornberry have said questions over donations she was given by a law firm are a "desperate smear".  The new shadow defence secretary got funding for a legal research assistant from Leigh Day to support her work when she was shadow attorney general.  Leigh Day has been referred to a legal tribunal for its role in representing Iraqis allegedly mistreated by UK troops during the Iraq war.  The Labour MP declared each donation at the time they were received.  According to Parliament's register of interests, Leigh Day funded three secondments worth a total of £48,125 between 2012 and 2014.  Two other law firms also provided funding for a similar research role during that period.  During Prime Minister's Questions, David Cameron said there were "questions to answer" over the Leigh Day donations, while Labour MP John Mann has suggested Ms Thornberry should return what he described as "vested interest money".  Friends of Ms Thornberry said that soldiers pursuing claims against the Ministry of Defence were among Leigh Day's many clients, who also included people suffering from the effects of the drug thalidomide, for whom the prime minister called for extra support on Wednesday.  In an interview with British Forces Broadcasting Services marking her appointment, Ms Thornberry said Leigh Day was an "outstanding" firm and the allegations against it "had nothing to do with any of the outstanding youngsters who gave their time to help us out here".  Leigh Day, she said, had offered "some of their brightest and best to help make sure the opposition had proper legal advice".  Leigh Day was referred on Tuesday to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal to answer complaints about its handling of legal challenges brought by Iraqi detainees against the Ministry of Defence.  It follows the findings of the 2014 Al-Sweady inquiry, which concluded that the most serious claims against British soldiers had been "deliberate lies, reckless speculation and ingrained hostility".  The firm has said the decision to refer it to the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal was "premature".  It has strongly denied allegations of wrongdoing, which, it said, it had not been given adequate time to respond to.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35247309	CES 2016: Netflix extends its service to almost all the world	Netflix has gone live in nearly every country in the world.  The firm announced it had switched on its service in 130 additional countries, but was still not able to stream video in China.  The announcement was made by the firm's chief executive Reed Hastings at his keynote speech at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.  He also confirmed that Netflix would begin offering HDR (high dynamic range) content later this year.  The company's shares jumped to about 6% above their opening price following the announcements.  "We were expecting Netflix to go everywhere, but this has happened more quickly than we thought," commented Fernando Elizalde from the tech consultancy Gartner.  "Until now the firm had been doing it in phased stages because of the costs of marketing and dubbing or subtitling the content.  "It's worth remembering that in some of the emerging economies it will only be people in urban areas that will be able to use it because of limited internet availability."  He added that Mr Hasting's stated ambition to add China would be a challenge.  "China is very restrictive when it comes to foreign-based media firms, so it won't be easy."  For consumers who already have Netflix, the biggest change may be the addition of HDR.  High dynamic range video allows compatible TVs to show millions more colours and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown.  Many experts believe the impact is greater than that of just jumping from 1080p to 4K ultra-high definition resolution alone. One consequence of using the format, however, is that it requires more data, and few TVs support it yet.  Mr Hastings said users with compatible TVs should get a "visceral sensation that's pretty amazing".  The firm's rival, Amazon, began streaming a limited number of shows in the format in 2015.  Audience members at the Las Vegas event were also given a first look at some of the service's forthcoming shows, including:  The firm also teased Chelsea Does..., a documentary series presented by the comedian Chelsea Handler that will cover topics including drugs, racism, marriage and Silicon Valley.  Ironically, the clips were blocked for those watching a live stream of the event.  Mr Hastings also revealed some fresh statistics about the service.  He said it now served a total of 125 million hours a day of entertainment to its viewers, and had streamed 12 billion hours-worth of video over the final three months of 2015, which is nearly 50% up on the same period in 2014.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35244777	Could Hilary Benn really be on the front and backbenches?	Could shadow foreign secretary Hilary Benn really speak from the back benches next time he disagrees with Jeremy Corbyn?  Hilary Benn made a barnstorming speech in favour of bombing Syria, while his boss Jeremy Corbyn, who disagreed with him, sat rather stony faced on the front bench behind him. Even though Labour MPs had been given a "free vote" on the issue, to allow the expression of opposing views, it screamed "split". A majority of Labour MPs voted with Corbyn, but Benn got a rare round of applause in the Commons and the plaudits of the nation's media pundits.  After much tortuous reshuffle negotiation, and speculation that he would be sacked, a compromise appeared to have been reached with Mr Benn. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell told the Today programme: "When it comes down to future debates we won't have a situation where he will be speaking from the front bench when there is a major disagreement on policy and where the Parliamentary Labour Party is in the majority against him." Mr Corbyn will speak from the front bench and "if there is a disagreement and people on a free vote want to express their views, they will do it from the back benches," he explained.  Hilary Benn insists he hasn't been "muzzled" and his team are briefing that there has been no deal. It is also worth stressing that it would that it would only apply in free votes, which are pretty rare. In a normal whipped vote, any shadow minister who fancied speaking out against the leader's position, would still have to resign or be sacked. Those are the rules.  It is not unprecedented for ministers, or shadow ministers, to speak from the backbenches, but it is normally on constituency matters or issues that are not part of their brief. No one can recall a frontbencher returning temporarily to the back benches to make a speech on something that they are meant to be leading on.  John McDonnell suggested in a BBC News Channel interview that Mr Benn could emulate himself and Mr Corbyn, who spent their lengthy careers to this point speaking from the back benches, often against their party leader. Not to be uncharitable to the pair, but hardly anyone in the media was interested when they did it. But if a senior figure like Mr Benn did it, it would almost certainly become the story. Conservative MPs would be beside themselves with glee.  David Cameron has decided to give his ministers the freedom to campaign for either side in the EU referendum in "a personal capacity". No one has said anything about Tory ministers making speeches on Europe from the back benches, if they disagree with the government's official view, but it would be one way round the problem....	politics

Vehicle manufacturers have also been keen to show off their sleek concept designs.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35235316	CES: What is driving car makers to attend tech show?	There are plenty of vehicle manufacturers at this year's Consumer Electronics Show, and they all have roughly the same message - it is time to shake up the industry.  No-one took that message more seriously than Volkswagen, a company mired in scandal over how it measured its emissions, and, when he took the stage at CES, chief executive Dr Herbert Diess was keen to apologise once again.  He said a "new and better Volkswagen" was being built that would concentrate on creating a future without noise, congestion, emissions or accidents.  He wanted to build cars that "make people happy", which is perhaps unsurprising given recent events.  Key to that would be electric, connected vehicles, Dr Diess said, showing off a concept van that harked back to the glory days of VW's iconic Camper, which he described as "the embodiment of peace, hope and happiness".  The BUDD-e four-wheel drive electric minivan could go into production within the next decade, Dr Diess said.  But it has been designed to show off a range of technologies:  The Verge described it as a "groovy, far-out vision of the future".  But CNet asked who would want a car that could "open the front door of your house, spy on your kids and potentially accept packages".  Car manufacturers have been exhibiting at CES since 2007 - but, this year, there seems to be a fresh determination to merge automotive and technology.  The event launching the much-hyped car from mysterious Chinese-backed Faraday Future was one of CES's most anticipated and best attended.  In a hard-to-find car park off the Las Vegas strip, the Batmobile-like vehicle was unveiled in a manner previously reserved for shiny gadgets.  "We want to be a technology company rather than an automotive company," senior vice-president Nick Sampson told the audience.  "Apple transformed the phone industry nine years ago, and that is what we at Faraday Future are seeking to do - to redefine the world of mobility."  That is a lofty ambition, and many doubt whether the company can achieve it. But it has had rapid growth since it launched 18 months ago.  It already employs 750 people and intends to add 4,500 more when it builds its first manufacturing plant in Las Vegas later this year.  But it was strange that, in a launch claiming to be about redefining mobility, the car remained static throughout.  In his keynote speech at CES, Ford chief executive Mark Fields said megacities with populations of 10 million or more, and a growing global middle class, were also contributing to the need to drastically rethink mobility "to make people's lives better".  There were some 800 million parking spaces in the US - but, in cities such as San Francisco, only 14% of people searching for a spot found one straight away.  And those cars driving around slowly looking for parking spaces accounted for 30% of urban congestion.  But Ford is not being entirely altruistic - it is keen to grab a share of the $5.4 trillion transportation service industry, with its own car-sharing and car-rental schemes.  Ford was the first automotive company to take to the CES stage, in 2007, when it joined Microsoft for a keynote.  This year, there was speculation it would announce a tie-up with Google.  But that did not happen - perhaps it plans to reverse roles and invite Google to the Detroit motor show later this month, where some experts predict it will announce the partnership.  Ford did, however, announce a tie-up with technology company Amazon, using its voice-activated speaker Echo to enhance communication between homes and cars - allowing motorists to open their garage before they arrive home, or turn the lights off from the car.  It also announced a novel partnership with the United Nations to find a way for cars and drones to communicate with each other, initially to help improve the response to natural disasters.  And it revealed it would be expanding its fleet of fully autonomous cars to 30, with a new licence to test them in California - which, by coincidence, is the home of Google.  During its press launch, Toyota concentrated on its $1bn investment the Toyota Research Institute.  Led by ex-Darpa project manager Dr Gill Pratt, the artificial intelligence research lab will have close ties with Stanford and MIT and Facebook's head of AI Yann LeCun as an adviser.  It will concentrate on teaching autonomous vehicles to respond to unexpected events, such as cargo falling out of a van travelling in front.  John Curran, an analyst with consultancy company Accenture, said: "A consensus is forming among auto experts that driverless technology will reach widespread adoption by 2030. For these vehicles, car companies will focus on driver security and safety."	tech

Twitter might have taken some explaining to the Earl for a start.  Occasionally there would be flurry of excitement as the lift went past.  The good news is it was a glass lift.  The bad news is it zipped past rather quickly.  Then, just before midnight, what counted for a dramatic development.  He was going to bed.  We still didn't have any news.  And, when it came, it wasn't so much the Night of the Long Knives as just a Very Long Night.  Very little actually changed.  Both this and the time the reshuffle took are indications of Mr Corbyn's limited room for manoeuvre.  "We never intended to have a Big Bang," Labour sources insisted.  With more than a hint of the absurd, us stairwell dwellers were then invited in for a briefing, well after midnight.  I've been to "early morning" briefings before, but this was a new spin on that genre.  In the briefing, Labour sources, as I'm obliged to call them, were clear about Jeremy Corbyn's goal: greater coherence on policy and less tolerance for what one called "abuse" from his colleagues.  And yet, take a look to the language used to justify the sacking of shadow culture secretary Michael Dugher: he was branded not just "disloyal" but "incompetent."  Mr Dugher told me it wasn't sensible for the leader's office to get into a debate with him about "loyalty" or "competence."  Pat McFadden, who had been shadow Europe minister, was "serially disloyal," sources said.  Friends of Mr McFadden expressed their anger, with one suggesting the Labour Party was being "driven off a cliff."  There's been a coarsening of language within the Labour movement in recent months when parts of it choose to describe their colleagues.  And this reshuffle has done nothing to change that.  It's also done nothing to change Jeremy Corbyn's fundamental challenge, of which this was just the latest case study: how does he square managing a party where plenty of his party members love him, but plenty of his MPs think he's a nightmare?  But, thankfully, my stairwell loitering does not.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35238645	CES 2016: Fitbit Blaze smartwatch sends shares into dive	Fitbit's shares plunged following the announcement of its first colour smartwatch at the CES tech show.  The San Francisco-based company's stock fell more than 18%.  That suggests investors were disappointed with its decision to take on more capable Android and Apple-powered watches by selling its own device at a cheaper price.  Huawei, Misfit and Withings were among other big brands to unveil new wearables at the Las Vegas show.  Huawei expanded its Android Wear-powered smartwatch family with two models targeted at women.  Misfit announced a small activity-monitoring metal cylinder that is designed to be worn alongside bracelets and watchbands.  And Withings revealed a budget-priced tracker with an e-ink display.  Fitbit may be the bestselling fitness tracker brand, but company-watchers have doubts about its move into new territory.  "It's an aggressive and risky move," commented Daniel Ives from FBR Research.  "Fitbit has been massively successful in its own niche of the market, and the jury's out on whether the Blaze smartwatch is the right move at the right time."  About 91.5 million smartwatches, sports watches and activity-tracking wristbands were shipped in 2015, according to tech research firm Gartner.  It predicts that number will rise to 116.4 million units this year.  The Blaze watch provides notification alerts and can control what music a wirelessly-connected smartphone is playing via its colour touchscreen.  But like the rest of the firm's line-up, its focus is on health.  It can track sleep and workouts, automatically detecting what activity the user is engaged in from a range of exercises including tennis, football, basketball, treadmill running and Zumba.  It can also display on-screen workouts from Fitstar - a popular app - measure the user's heart rate and last up to five days between charges.  Unlike the firm's earlier Surge "super watch" it does not include its own GPS chip, so it must be paired with a phone to provide location-tracking data.  The central module costs $200 (£136) and can be swapped between a range of octagonal-shaped wristbands and straps that will cost between $30 and $130.  That makes it cheaper than the Apple Watch and devices running Google's Android Wear operating system.  The question is whether consumers will prefer to spend more to have the ability to tap into a large library of third-party apps.  "When you compare Fitbit to companies like Apple and Google it doesn't have the software talent to offer a fully-fledged mobile operating system," commented Daniel Matte from the Canalys consultancy.  "But at this price point it's pretty good value and is a natural next step for the firm."  But another analyst questioned the wisdom of entering the smartwatch sector.  "If I were an investor, I would ask 'what competitive advantage does Fitbit bring to the table?' and 'do we want to compete against Apple, Google and Samsung?'" said Julie Ask from Forrester Research.  "Having an app ecosystem, and ease of use is so important in this sector."  The aluminium pod can be worn on a strap or around the neck, and runs for up to six months at a time using replaceable batteries.  It does not feature a screen, but has an LED that flashes different colours and can also vibrate to provide alerts.  Its only sensor is an accelerometer, which is used to track activities and sleep.  The firm said the $99 device was deliberately designed to have a "minimalist" appearance so it could be worn alongside other accessories.  "Misfit was one of the first companies to embrace more fashionable wearables, and the Ray is another positive step in delivering an attractive device with broader appeal to women than the ubiquitous black plastic fitness band," commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight consultancy.  Misfit was recently taken over by Fossil, which makes watches and jewellery under brands that include Diesel, Michael Kors, Emporio Armani, and Relic.  Its technology is now set to be incorporated into a wide range of fashion-focused wearables planned by its parent company.  French firm Withings' latest device is even cheaper and lasts longer.  The Withings Go costs $70 - or £49 in the UK - and uses an e-ink screen to maximise its battery life.  The firm says a replaceable button cell should last eight months at a time.  It connects to smartphone app and can track swimming among other activities thanks to being water resistant.  Huawei said its new watches were designed for "women who sparkle and shine".  The Jewel and Elegant editions both have 44mm-diameter (1.7in) circular screens - which are bigger than the 42mm original design - and are encased in stainless steel plated with rose gold.  The $599 Jewel version features 68 Swarovski crystals dotted around its case, while the $499 Elegant one has a "knurled" pattern instead.  In other respects the wristwear is similar to the original models launched in 2015 apart from the addition of 10 new digital watch faces, which the firm says offer a more "feminine design".  Mr Wood suggested the Chinese firm should have taken the opportunity to add other software features.  "Pink, shiny and blingy is a long way from women's technology emancipation," he said.  "A 'wearable for women' should offer a lot more than a few Swarovski gems and a shiny finish - the implication is that women don't care about functions which is naive."  Huawei follows Motorola, which released a female-targeted version of its Android Wear Moto 360 watch in September.  "This is an area where the wearables market is moving," remarked Mr Ives.  "But a bigger issue is that there needs to be a killer app outside of health.  "The question remains which of the players will be able to take the market into a new direction."

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35239815	CES 2016: The moment I nearly threw up at a VR demo	Tech demos don't always go to plan.  Today it was my turn, as a virtual reality demo here at the CES tech show went badly wrong.  It started well. In an elegant hotel suite at the top of the famous strip, gaming chip-maker Nvidia gave a slick presentation about its Shield product - an Android-based TV connected device that offers a host of high quality entertainment options, including VR.  Then, it was time to try some new VR titles.  Overall, I've been quietly impressed with VR. I've tried various headsets in various stages of development and seen some amazing virtual sights.  At home, I'm starting to think my family members are growing Google Cardboards out of their foreheads - although I know some VR aficionados say they don't count.  The day's first experience was mind blowing. Inside a small empty room, wearing an HTC Vive, I climbed Mount Everest.  The graphics were superb - actual footage provided by the makers of the movie Everest. And wherever I looked - up down, around - there I was in the Himalayas.  Even a glitch, when my hands went through the mountain, didn't dampen the moment - that's how intense it was.  I recorded my first impressions for our radio show Tech Tent as I stumbled tentatively around the mountain, teetering over vast ice chasms on tiny bridges and climbing a vertical ladder up a sheer face known as Death Falls.  Listening back to the recording, my voice actually cracked with emotion when I reached the top.  Everest duly conquered, it was time to take a trip into outer space with a demo of another new game called Adr1ft.  The Rift VR headset applied, I was given an Xbox controller. Now, I'm familiar enough with them but not to the extent that they are like an extra hand - and of course with the headset on you can't actually see it.  Suddenly, I was floating inside a glass windowed dome above earth not dissimilar to the cupola on board the International Space Station.  Various bits of debris surrounded me. It was powerful - but the constrictions of being inside a virtual space helmet gave the visuals a tighter window than I had expected.  The developer, Adam Orth, is passionate about VR. He started to tell me that Adr1ft was based on personal experience.  "Have you been into space?" I asked, as I sat through the tuition video - although I have to admit by the time it had finished I'd already forgotten which buttons did what, and I was also distracted by trying to explain what was around me for the radio show.  "No. It was… metaphorical," he answered.  But before I could find out what he meant, suddenly, I found I just couldn't move.  Nothing responded as I expected. I couldn't even get to the space ship hatch to get outside and start my mission. I started to feel very hot and very disorientated. I was tumbling around, bumping into walls and debris and no longer knew which way was up. My virtual space helmet visor was cracking.  Within about 30 seconds I wanted to rip the helmet off and run to the bathroom.  "Let me just get you out of the ship…." he said, taking the control from my hands.  But it was too much - I had to remove the headset.  "We've never had this reaction before," he said.  He started pressing buttons and his face lit up.  "The controller is configured wrong!" he said.  "No wonder you couldn't do it."  I'm not sure whether this was a polite ruse to save my dignity.  "I still don't think I feel very confident about continuing," I said sadly.  "Would you tell me about your inspiration for the game?"  I sensed my time was up. After some small talk we said a polite goodbye and Mr Orth did ask if I wanted to continue, but I think we both knew the moment had passed. And I was seriously worried about throwing up.  I left the suite, immediately took a wrong turn and found myself totally lost in the labyrinth that is the average Las Vegas hotel.  When I finally did get outside, I walked the wrong way up the strip in the pouring rain. The disorientation stayed with me for about half an hour afterwards, and I felt too nauseous to get in a taxi.  Now - it could be that I'm just not cut out for VR gaming. It could also be that I'm nursing a winter cold and I'm not fighting fit for space travel.  But now I have experienced first-hand the weirdness that VR can induce - seemingly very suddenly - and I didn't like it. I am in a very small minority, I am told, and I hadn't felt it before.  "There's always going to be a small percentage of the population that gets motion sickness, there's no way around that," said Brian Blau from the tech research firm Gartner.  "But for most people, it usually won't be a problem.  "For the most part, when there's motion sickness it's caused by the app. Developers have to work hard to avoid types of situations that cause the problem.  "Making VR is not easy, it will take time and experience."  My experience hasn't put me off virtual reality, but it has made me cautious.  And I guess my future career as an astronaut is dead in the water.  Read more of our CES articles and follow the BBC team covering the show on Twitter.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35239814	CES 2016: Intel drone dodges 'falling tree' on stage	Chip-maker Intel has revealed a collision-avoiding drone that automatically dodges obstacles in its path.  The device was demoed at the CES tech show where it autonomously detected and avoided a fallen object.  Intel part-owns Yuneec, the company behind the drone, and provided the device's 3D camera sensor.  The RealSense technology involved uses infrared lasers to detect the distance of nearby things.  Should evasive action be necessary, the aircraft takes it on its own.  At CES, the Typhoon H drone followed a cyclist through a small course on stage, complete with a handful of mock "trees".  When one of these obstacles was made to fall in the drone's path, it dodged it, and thereby avoided a collision.  "The drone was able to stop, wait and go round that obstacle as well - following the rider all the time," said Intel's chief executive Brian Krzanich.  "Any other commercial drone out there would have crashed into the tree."  The Typhoon H also has a 4K camera which has can pan 360-degrees and take photographs with a 12 megapixel sensor.  Intel said it would be on sale within six months. It is set to cost $1,799 (£1,200).  Features such as collision avoidance are not likely to prevent the kind of tumbles which nearly caught skier Marcel Hirsher last month, commented IHS analyst Tom Morrod, when a drone malfunctioned.  "There's a safety aspect which is probably not going to go away - things that fly occasionally crash," he said.  However, he added, the benefits of more intelligent drones are not to be underestimated.  "Things like collision avoidance, self navigation, spatial awareness - all of these technologies that take away the manual control of the drones are enabling drones for commercial purposes," he said.  "Those could be security or delivery or maintenance, all of those types of applications - that's going to be what really drives the market."  Another safety conscious drone at CES comes in the form of Belgian firm Fleye's device. It encloses its spinning blades within both a shell and a cage to help reduce the risk of injury.  However, as a demo for the BBC proved, it is still possible for the device to swerve off-course and crash.  Parrot announced another new drone - one capable of flying much further and faster than helicopter-inspired devices, thanks to a fixed wing design.  The Disco drone can fly for up to 45 minutes and follow a pre-planned flight path via GPS waypoints.  Its on-board camera is embedded into the drone's nose and captures video in 1080p high definition.  Parrot hopes to make the device available later in 2016.  "This 'drone on steroid' speaks to the innovation in this wave of consumer drones," said Daniel Ives, an analyst at FBR Research.  "We believe this is a $3bn market opportunity over the next few years and high-octane drones like Parrot's are a sign of things to come."

Fleye keeps its moving parts inside a cage covered with a protective grid, which the firm says means it can bump into people without the risk of injury.  It has led the firm to claim that it is on verge of creating the "world's safest drone" - an important consideration at a time when incidents involving unmanned aircraft are on the rise.  However, as BBC Click's Jen Copestake discovered, the prototype is rather accident-prone.  Read more of our CES articles and follow the BBC team covering the show on Twitter.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35239586	CES 2016: Revived Technics turntables revealed by Panasonic	Panasonic has revealed the capabilities of its revived Technics turntables at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.  Two Technics SL-1200 models were unveiled - one of which is limited to a run of 1,200 units - marking the first update in years to the brand.  Panasonic has said the launch was inspired by a resurgence in vinyl record sales.  The production of Technics turntables had ceased in 2010.  At the time, some audiophiles and DJs had expressed disappointment over the well known brand's discontinuation.  But in September last year, Panasonic said that Technics would return.  The decision to halt the production of Technics turntables five years ago was a "strange" one, according to Andy Clough, editor of What Hi-Fi magazine.  "They had a fantastic brand with a huge heritage," he said. "From our point of view [the re-launch is] really exciting, it's a sort of update if you like on an iconic turntable - something of a legend amongst DJs and hi-fi people."  Mr Clough commented that while there was a resurgence in vinyl sales, the boom should be viewed in context.  "It's still very much a niche thing - albeit a growing niche," he said.  Panasonic has included a new motor in the updated turntable, which is designed to be quieter and less prone to vibrations than previous models. The result is, the firm claims, better sound quality.  Both editions will be released later in 2016 with the 50th Anniversary model, the Grand Class SL-1200GAE, being made available this summer in a limited edition run.  Retro audio formats aren't the only nostalgic tech featuring at CES this year.  Kodak has also announced an initiative to revive the Super 8 video format and is presenting a prototype of a new Kodak Super 8 camera.  It features digital functionality - including an LCD screen allowing users to frame and view recorded scenes live.  The company's initiative has already garnered support from top Hollywood directors including Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino and Steve McQueen - all of whom have praised the qualities of Super 8 film.  There are no details on when Kodak's new camera might be released - or what it would cost - but the company has said it has developed a roadmap for eventually producing a new range of Super 8 devices as well as film development services.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35238636	CES 2016: L'Oreal unveils super-thin smart skin patch	Beauty giant L'Oreal has unveiled a smart skin patch that can track the skin's exposure to harmful UV rays at the technology show CES in Las Vegas.  The product will be launched in 16 countries including the UK this summer, and will be available for free.  It contains a photosensitive blue dye, which changes colour when exposed to ultraviolet light.  But the wearer must take a photo of it and then upload it to an app to see the results.  It has been developed by the firm's tech incubator department, which is a team of 25 scientists and researchers working in several cities around the world, including New York, Paris and Singapore.  The My UV Patch, which is thinner than a plaster and lasts around five days, is disposable. It can be worn on any part of the body.  "Today all the wearables you see are jewellery or wrist bands - but not wearable in the sense that you wear them anywhere on your body," Guive Balooch global vice president of L'Oréal's Technology Incubator, told the BBC.  "Why would L'Oreal be interested in this? When you think about our products, the people apply them all over their body," he explained.  "Being able to have this technology to measure properties of the skin in real life anywhere you want allows us to develop really new testing methods for future products."  While there are other devices on the market for measuring UV exposure L'Oreal believes this is the first example of a flexible wearable.  "Stickers on the market today go from white to blue in minutes, and then that's it," he said.  "You can use ours for days and days."  However, Mr Balooch cautioned that the patch was not intended as a reminder to re-apply suncream.  "The issue is not when to reapply, the issue is how much exposure do I have," he said.  The idea is a "pretty amazing" one according to Carolina Milanesi, chief of research at the KWP Comtech research firm.  "UV is a different focus and one that makes a lot of sense coming from L'Oreal," she said.  However, Mrs Milanesi added that the need to keep taking pictures of the patch might become frustrating for customers.  "I wonder if rather than seeing the cumulative impact in an app I would prefer to be alerted when my UV exposure will cause sun burn or worse," she commented.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35238349	MPs to debate calls to ban Donald Trump	MPs are to debate whether to bar Donald Trump from entering the UK in response to a public petition calling for action against the US Presidential candidate.  About 568,000 people have backed a petition calling on the tycoon to be barred for comments he made about banning Muslims from the US.  Labour MP Paul Flynn will lead a debate in Westminster Hall on 18 January.  David Cameron has condemned Mr Trump, who has major business interests in the UK, but said he should be allowed in.  The Commons petitions committee decided to hold a debate on the issue after considering the matter at a meeting on Tuesday. Under the current rules, MPs have to consider any petition with 100,000 signatures for discussion in Parliament.  The debate will be held in the Commons' secondary debating chamber rather than the full chamber and there will be no vote at the end of it.  Helen Jones, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it would allow for "a range of views" to be expressed.  "By scheduling a debate on these petitions, the committee is not expressing a view on whether or not the government should exclude Donald Trump from the UK," she said.  "As with any decision to schedule a petition for debate, it simply means that the committee has decided that the subject should be debated."  But Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron questioned the decision to allocate parliamentary time to discussing Mr Trump.  He tweeted: "Trump is a bloviating billionaire with downright offensive views. But I'd rather we debated inequality or the NHS."  Mr Trump is currently the frontrunner, in some opinion polls, for the Republican nomination but he has been roundly criticised for comments he made about Muslims in the wake of December's fatal San Bernardino shootings - remarks which critics said were offensive and inflammatory.  Home Secretary Theresa May, who makes decisions on banning orders, has said she cannot comment on the case.  A rival petition opposing a ban on Mr Trump as illogical has been signed by nearly 40,000 people. This will also be debated by MPs.	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35220413	Jeremy Corbyn reshuffle: Dugher hits back after sacking	Michael Dugher has told BBC News he was sacked by Jeremy Corbyn for speaking up for colleagues who had been "trashed" by members of the Labour leader's team.  The ex-shadow culture secretary is the first - and so far only - casualty of Mr Corbyn's front bench reshuffle.  Shadow defence secretary Maria Eagle has been told that she will be moved.  A planned meeting of the shadow cabinet at lunchtime was cancelled as the changes are taking longer than planned.  Mr Corbyn is continuing to hold meetings with close aides, with no indication yet about when an announcement will be made.  Mr Dugher - who ran Andy Burnham's leadership campaign - told BBC News: "I decided to speak out a number of days ago because what we've seen in recent weeks is a number of good hardworking loyal members of the shadow cabinet being systematically trashed, in terms of their reputations, in their newspapers by people in the employment of Jeremy Corbyn.  "It was de-stabilising and I felt it was right to speak out about that and I appear to have paid the price for that. But I don't regret it for one second."  He also said that the biggest casualty in the reshuffle had been the "new politics" and despite promises from the leader that there would be room for a little dissent, "the truth is that's just not transpired".  The sacking of the Barnsley East MP, a close ally of former leader Gordon Brown who is known for his combative style, has been met with dismay by senior Labour figures.  Shadow defence minister Toby Perkins said: "Sad to hear this, always effective at putting Tories on the back foot, something we need to do more of."  Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said: "Michael Dugher is a rare politician - a talented working-class MP who hasn't lost his strong Yorkshire roots.  "Politicians with his ability and commitment can make a difference in any role. Labour's loss in the shadow cabinet will be compensated by Michael's free thought on the backbenches."  Will this turn out to be the reshuffle that never was?  One member of the shadow cabinet said, "it was all on, and then it was all off again".  A senior Labour figure tells me now that despite the target on Hilary Benn's back, that Jeremy Corbyn has "backed down", and the shadow foreign secretary is absolutely safe in his job.  Whatever the final details today, the bigger question in the longer term is whether even the threat of sackings will change the dynamics...  There has been speculation Mr Corbyn would purge his front bench team of critical voices so that the party could have a unified position on important issues such as defence and security.  Mr Corbyn has held lengthy talks with Mr Benn, who spoke out against Mr Corbyn's position on bombing Syria, and Maria Eagle, who opposes the Labour leader on nuclear weapons.  The BBC understood on Monday evening that Mr Benn would be keeping his job, but sources have since suggested that he may yet be moved, or sacked.  A further nine shadow cabinet members voted for air strikes after Mr Corbyn was forced to allow a free vote. There is speculation that shadow ministers have threatened a mass walk out if Mr Benn was sacked.  The former London mayor, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said he did not believe the Labour leader had ever intended to sack Mr Benn and speculation about his future had been whipped up by the media.  He also suggested Mr Benn's position had become more secure because he had "stopped being quite so critical and dissident".	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35232288	T-Mobile 'breaks' net neutrality rules' with Binge On	T-Mobile is breaking net neutrality rules with its new video streaming service Binge On, a report has said.  The service lets users download unlimited amounts of low-resolution video from partners such as Netflix.  But the Electronic Frontier Foundation said Binge On was affecting the quality of other providers' videos too - even if they were not partnered with the service.  T-Mobile has not commented on the claims.  Binge On is offered to all new T-Mobile customers in the US - giving them the chance to watch more video without exceeding their data allowances.  But YouTube has complained it was being affected by the so-called "zero-rating" service.  In December it said users were receiving its content at reduced download speeds - even though YouTube is not a Binge On partner.  A representative of the Google-backed company told the Wall Street Journal: "Reducing data charges can be good for users, but it doesn't justify throttling all video services, especially without explicit user consent."  T-Mobile did not respond to BBC requests for comment, but told DSL Reports last week that the term "throttle" was misleading.  "We aren't slowing down YouTube or any other site. In fact, because video is optimised for mobile devices, streaming from these sites should be just as fast, if not faster than before," it said.  It said that a better phrase would be "mobile optimised or a less flattering 'downgraded'".  However, the EFF has since tested the service and disputes the claims.  In a blog published this week, it said that when Binge On was enabled, T-Mobile "throttles all HTML5 video streams to around 1.5MB per second, regardless of whether or not the video provider enrolled in Binge On".  It added that if a video was more than 480 pixels resolution - and the server sending it did not have a way to adapt the bit rate - the result was "stuttering and uneven streaming".  "[This is] exactly the opposite of the experience T-Mobile claims their 'optimisation' will have," it said.  It said T-Mobile was breaking US net neutrality rules, which forbid the prioritising or de-prioritising of certain types of internet traffic.  However, so-called zero-rating services still represent a legal grey area in the US. The Federal Communications Commission is set to meet T-Mobile and other service providers next week to discuss the matter.  T-Mobile has not commented on EFF's net neutrality claims, but did clarify that by "optimisation", it simply meant it was reducing the bandwidth allocated to video streams.  Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Midia Research, said partnerships between telecoms and content providers would become more common.  "The telcos are looking to add value, but they tend to lose money through these tie-ups because the rights costs are so high and they cost so much to market," he said.  "However, T-Mobile seems to have got around that problem by opening up Binge On to video services, simply by zero rating their content."	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35229548	CES 2016: HTC Vive virtual reality headset gets upgraded	Taiwanese tech firm HTC has revealed changes to its forthcoming virtual reality headset at the CES tech show.  The Vive's release was delayed after what chief executive Cher Wang described as a "very, very big technological breakthrough".  This has been revealed to be a camera system that allows the wearer to see objects in the physical room around them, helping to avoid collisions.  Some have questioned whether the device will be affordable, though.  By pressing a button on a handheld controller, the user can see objects near them ghosted in to the virtual reality environment.  This merging of physical and digital is intended as a safety feature - and a solution to one of the practical problems facing VR.  HTC plans to launch the Vive in April.  Pre-orders for a rival PC-powered headset, the Rift by Oculus, are set to begin on Wednesday. However, the Facebook-owned firm has yet to reveal when they will be delivered.  The other major headset on show at the Vegas event is the PlayStation VR, which works with Sony's games console.  "For too long, the promise of virtual reality has been little more than a promise," said Ms Wang.  "Today we stand on the precipice of a new era. Vive is creating a world where the only limit is human imagination."  The headset's improvements over a version revealed in February include:  HTC would not reveal any details on pricing, but when pushed it acknowledged the cost might prove a barrier to mass-market adoption.  "It is a very good experience but if you already have, say a PlayStation, then PlayStation VR is going to be a quicker and cheaper way to get into it," said Stuart Miles, editor of tech site Pocket-lint.  Today, in Vegas, I stood on the deck of a shipwreck and watched a blue whale float past - all in the comfort of a hotel suite.  I was trying out HTC's new, improved virtual reality headset and it was quite an experience.  The ability for 360-degree viewing makes it very immersive and the content is compelling. But whether I would invest in it is another matter.  At Christmas, my children played around with the much cheaper and currently available Google Cardboard and while that is a totally different experience it seemed to satisfy their immediate VR needs.  Competition in the virtual reality market is primed to be fierce in 2016, according to Michael Goodman of Strategy Analytics.  "This is like a bunch of competitors, right at the starting line, eying each other just before the gun goes off," he said.  Attempts to popularise VR flopped in the 1990s, but Mr Goodman said that a positive sign this time was that several content-producing firms had already announced VR titles and franchises before the headsets had gone on sale.  "That's really unprecedented in the media entertainment space," he added.  HTC also unveiled a trio of health-related devices as part of a tie-up with the fitness specialist Under Armour.  They will be sold together for $400 (£270) in a product titled HealthBox.  The first is the UA Band, an all-day wristband for tracking activity, exercise and sleep.  The second, the UA Heart Rate monitor, is designed to be strapped to the wearer's chest during workouts in order to detect heartbeats and calculate calories burned.  Finally, there is the UA Scale, a wi-fi connected set of scales which sync with a companion app so that users can track weight fluctuations over time.  "There is nothing amazingly new here," remarked Mr Miles.  "Rather, it is the sum of its parts and some will like the ease of a $400 box set for health and fitness."

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35233683	UK and the EU: How to make a Brexit	BBC political correspondent Carolyn Quinn explores how Britain would exit the EU if voters opt to leave in the referendum.  We don't know when David Cameron will call the EU referendum but for a BBC radio documentary, How to Make a Brexit, I examined what would happen in the days, the weeks and the months after that referendum if the British people vote to leave the EU.  We're not talking about the raging arguments over whether we would prosper or fade economically, or whether we'd make better policy choices than the bureaucrats in Brussels. We're talking about the exact steps that would need to be followed should voters favour Brexit.  Until 2007, joining the European club was assumed to be a one-way ticket. There was no formal mechanism in the rules setting out how a state could leave the European Union.  But there is now. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty sets out a road map. It boils down to a couple of deceptively simple steps. The prime minister would have to write a letter to the President of the European Council notifying him of the intention to leave. The council would appoint a lead negotiator and a negotiating team.  A two-year window to negotiate a withdrawal treaty would follow - if Britain decides it wants one. The window could be expanded by a year if necessary. Any withdrawal treaty would be concluded by the European Council through qualified majority voting and then ratified by the European Parliament and the Westminster Parliament.  Britain would be carving out an unprecedented path. No nation state has ever held a referendum and then left the EU.  But there is one part of one country that has gone through the process of getting out - Greenland, one of Denmark's overseas territories and the world's largest island that is not a continent. It staged a referendum in 1982 after gaining a high degree of self-government from Denmark.  Greenlanders voted 52/48 to leave the EU. There followed a series of difficult and protracted negotiations between the Greenland and Danish governments, and the Danish government and the European Commission, particularly with regard to fisheries.  I travelled to Greenland - a vast land mass that is almost entirely ice cap, with scattered settlements around the coast. There are no roads outside the capital.  On the day we landed, it was -29C. It has a population of about 56,000 - a quarter of them live in Nuuk, the capital, on the south-west coast just below the Arctic Circle.  There, I spoke to the men who led Greenland's Out campaign in the 1980s.  "I was very proud when we won our referendum in 1982. There were 500 million people in Europe, and we, in Greenland were just 50,000, but we said 'no,'" said Lars-Emil Johansen, now speaker of the Greenlandic Parliament.  Veteran activist and politician Kaj Kleist said: "I cried at that moment, when we won the referendum in 1982 I remember that the chairman of the commission Jacques Delors said tonight we just lost 60% of the EU's territory."  He explained that Greenlandic fishermen resented being told by Brussels how much fish they could take out of their own waters and watching their fish stocks being hoovered up by EU factory trawlers.  Henrik Leth, who chairs the largest privately-run fishing company in Greenland - Polar Seafood, said there was a noticeable change for the industry after leaving the EU.  "We built up, and now have a very powerful industry," he said.  Two of the biggest fisheries companies in Denmark were Greenlandic, he said, and Polar Seafood was in the top 10 in Europe.  As Henrik took me on a drive around Nuuk - with its three sets of traffic lights (the only ones in the whole of Greenland) he told me more about the deal struck with the EEC.  In return for allowing continued European access to its waters, Greenland was given tariff-free access to the Community market for fisheries products. It also got EU funding on top of the money it received and continues to receive from Denmark.  Interestingly, Henrik now wonders whether the time might be right for Greenland to consider rejoining the EU, as it would give Greenland access to even greater markets like Japan and China.  He told me "little Greenland" had very little leverage with the Chinese as a nation on its own.  "What do we have to give? I mean we can tell China we will not buy Chinese products but there are more people in an office block in Shanghai than there are in Greenland so we can't possibly put on the same sort of pressure as the European Union and other big nations can."  But he admits asking to go back into the EU would be a tricky step to take.  "It has to be analysed and will be a bitter pill to swallow but on the other hand, now we have our fishing industry they will not be able to take that away from us and go back to what it was like before 1985," said Henrik.  It took the best part of three years to negotiate Greenland's exit deal. It finally left the EU in 1985. What does that tell us about Britain's prospects?  In Britain's case, the economy is many times larger and more complex, and the responsibilities and membership of the EU have ballooned over the past 30 years. If the prime minister were to invoke Article 50 and inform the European Council of Britain's intention to leave, there would be a staggering array of issues to negotiate including:  I took a trip to the European Parliament in Brussels to ask what would happen to the UK's small army of ministers, MEPs, commissioners and civil servants working within EU institutions.  UKIP's Diane James assured me that British MEPs would fulfil their role right to the very end - even agreeing or opposing pieces of legislation that, in the end, could have no impact on a departed Britain.  I sought the advice of Stephen Booth, head of the Open Europe think tank which supports EU reform. The group organised its own day of wargames to test out some of the pinch points in any potential Brexit negotiations, and is planning another later in January.  Economist Ruth Lea and Charles Grant from the pro-EU think tank, the Centre for European Reform, disagreed over how ready the UK was for the potential negotiating task ahead.  "We don't have any trade negotiators in Whitehall - we haven't had any since 1973," said Mr Grant. "The British government would be hard-pressed to find people to do a trade negotiation. They might have to borrow civil servants from other European countries or get old people out of retirement."  But Ruth Lea insisted: "I'm not worried about that because we are very good in this country at importing talent if we want to, for example we have a Canadian as governor of the Bank of England".  Another question I pose in the documentary is about the preparedness of Whitehall for the Brexit negotiations, should they come.  Former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell believes that every civil servant will be thinking: "What if?... There will be a lot of work going on mentally, but how much they write down is a different question. That is one of the potential drawbacks of the world of Freedom of Information we live in."  And finally with a referendum due to take place at the latest by the end of 2017, could all of the detailed unravelling required in the case of a Brexit be completed in a two, or possibly three, year negotiating window?  Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe QC has his doubts, and says he would rather not see the UK stay in an unreformed EU. He believes Britain should just walk away if it hasn't reached a deal by the end of two years.  "The two-year time limit would allow the process to be completed and concluded within the current parliament," he said.  "But, if it is extended, you will then be going across into a new Parliament with a General Election and in the meantime there might be a change of government and, at minimum, the negotiation process then gets tangled up in the General Election campaign."  All depends now on the outcome of the referendum.  Lord O'Donnell said in the end Britain and the EU would have to work out ways of co-existing.  Divorce can sometimes be painful, he said, but it did not have to be messy. The secret to breaking up is the same for states as for people - good planning, good sense and an ability to learn how to live and trade together in a shrinking world.  How to make a Brexit is broadcast at 20:00 GMT on BBC Radio 4 on Tuesday, 5 January and again at 17:00 GMT on Sunday or anytime on the iPlayer	politics
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35231252	Zac Goldsmith accuses Sadiq Khan of 'playing race card'	Zac Goldsmith has accused his Labour rival to be London mayor Sadiq Khan of "playing the race card".  The Tory MP was reacting to claims he had tried to make an issue of Mr Khan's Muslim faith by describing him in a leaflet as "radical and divisive".  Mr Goldsmith said he had been referring to the "extraordinarily radical" changes that have happened to Labour under Jeremy Corbyn.  Mr Goldsmith said Mr Khan had nominated Mr Corbyn for the Labour leadership and had been selected as the party's mayoral candidate by the "same voters" - and had been part of the same "radical process".  "If I cannot use the term radical to describe what has happened to the Labour Party... then I don't know when I would be able to use the term," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.  He added: "I think he is playing with fire. I don't think there is anything more divisive than playing the race card, when, clearly and unambiguously, it does not apply.  "It 's very obvious that what I was referring to when I described him as a radical candidate as part of a radical process that has enveloped the Labour Party and taken our politics in an extraordinary direction."  But Mr Khan's team hit back by accusing the Conservative candidate of "dog whistle" politics - sending coded racist messages to voters.  A spokesman said: "It was the Goldsmith campaign which put out the infamous dog-whistle leaflet branding Sadiq as 'radical' just because he happens to be a Muslim.  "And it was Goldsmith's campaign which had to launch an investigation after alleged racist remarks from a Tory canvasser to a voter.  "Their campaign is already so desperate.... they simply have no answers to the challenges London faces like fixing the housing crisis and keeping fares down."  Mr Khan insisted an interview with Today on Monday that he would be "my own man" if he wins the race to succeed Boris Johnson in May - and the contest would not be decided by Jeremy Corbyn's policies.  The Tooting MP, a former lawyer and the son of a bus driver, said he would not attack Mr Goldsmith over his background as the son of billionaire financier Sir James Goldsmith, but said voters should consider whether they wanted a mayor whose only previous "proper job" was as editor of The Ecologist magazine, founded by his uncle, Edward Goldsmith.  He said: "London is one of the leading global commercial cities in the world, so I ask the question 'Do you want as Mayor of London ... someone who has never had a proper job, someone whose only job was one given you by your uncle to run his niche magazine?"'	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35230245	CES Unveiled 2016: Smart jewellery and hair growth helmets	I've just returned from CES Unveiled - a surreal smorgasbord of tech inventions great and small.  The event is designed to offer a preview of some of the 3,500 exhibitors who are flocking to Las Vegas this week to show off their creations at the world's largest gadget show.  From robots to wristbands, cameras to cocktails, there was plenty to try your hand at, if you felt brave enough - some of the prototypes were more robust than others, and some were not particularly flattering.  A firm called Ziro has developed a modular robotics kit that lets anybody create their own robot in just 30 minutes, program it via an app and then gesture control it using a smart glove.  Its demo model bore a striking resemblance to a certain Star Wars character and, perhaps true to form, it wasn't as responsive as I'd hoped. Shortly after my attempt "R2" mysteriously disappeared from the show floor altogether so perhaps it met its match with my fat fingers.  In the next aisle was Sphero, the firm behind the wildly successful Star Wars BB-8 toy robot, showing off a miniature version that could be controlled via a smart wristband.  It is due to launch this autumn - but a spokeswoman told me the battery life needed "refining" - which probably means it doesn't last very long.  I watched a few hapless journalists struggling to get the erratic BB-8 to respond to their commands before deciding a drink was in order.  Conveniently, an app-controlled robot cocktail maker, Somabar, was dishing out cocktails just around the corner.  In the interests of research I tried a Margarita - a little nervously, as my colleague Jane Wakefield was decidedly unimpressed by the mixing skills of the robotic bar on board Royal Caribbean's luxury cruise ship Anthem of the Seas when she visited recently.  Happily my choice of tipple was OK, if a little bland.  Perhaps I should have tried a second just to be sure, but Pico Brew was also calling. The "smart beer brewer" is able to make beer in just two hours using pre-packed ingredients and recipes downloaded online.  To distract me from the drinking there was fortunately also plenty of health-related tech on display. I tried out the Reliefband anti-sickness bracelet, designed to cure any potential nausea by making me feel a little bit like I was being electrocuted instead.  After applying a gel you wear the watch-like device with the face down, so that it targets the area between the tendons in your wrist. You then turn up the power until you feel a tingling sensation in your middle finger. It's a very strange feeling - not painful, but somehow uncontrolled.  "It targets a well known acupuncture pressure point on the wrist," said the company's Marco Stone.  "It was initially developed in hospitals for treating chemotherapy-induced nausea."  We've all heard of laser hair removal but curiously there were two laser hair regrowth devices on display at CES Unveiled, one by HairMax and the other by Aspira Science.  HairMax has a range of products including a Laserband, which looks like Jordy La Forge's glasses for those who like their Star Trek. Aspira Science's iGrow resembles a bicycle helmet. One honest soul on Twitter told me I looked like an "evil cyborg" in it.  Both are said to use low-level light therapy to "re-energise" hair follicles, and the iGrow has been cleared by the American FDA to be sold over-the-counter.  First Alert offered a suite of wi-fi-connected alarms that sent a phone notification when they registered high levels of smoke or carbon monoxide in your home. They could also measure indoor temperature and humidity and had a 10 year battery life.  However, the products have been developed on the Apple Homekit platform and are not currently compatible with Android or Windows devices.  Meanwhile a firm called Wearwise addressed the issue of personal safety, revealing a range of chunky bangles/health trackers that could also be programmed to send a distress text to pre-arranged contacts in the event of an emergency.  The wearer sets a pattern - say three taps - to activate the distress signal.  Wearwise has worked with a number of designers in an attempt to make the wearables attractive and has even drawn inspiration from 93-year-old style icon Iris Apfel.  "We know that tech and fashion don't always speak the same language," said chief marketing officer Jordan Ramirez.  "We are creating wearables that women actually want to wear."  As a woman who habitually fiddles with all her jewellery I asked if there was any way to deactivate the alert if it was raised by accident.  He said that setting the pattern yourself means you can choose an unusual sequence of actions - but ultimately, once activated, the only way to reassure your panicking loved ones is to send them a manual all-clear text yourself.  "Ultimately we think safety is more important than false alarms," he said.  You can't really argue with that - although I'm not certain my nearest and dearest would rush to volunteer to be my emergency bracelet contacts for that very reason.  Strategically positioned right by the exit was a very inviting looking bed belonging to Sleep Number.  The bed tracks your sleep and can recommend the ultimate recipe - from temperature to diet - for your own personal perfect slumber. If you can get over the fact that you are being closely monitored for long enough to get any sleep in the first place, that is.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35225780	Syria crisis: UK should take in 3,000 children, say MPs	The UK should take in 3,000 child refugees stranded in Europe, as part of its humanitarian response to the Syrian conflict, MPs have said.  The International Development Committee said it backed calls from charities for the UK to accept more unaccompanied minors as a matter of "utmost urgency".  Lone children risked being forced into prostitution or the drugs trade unless given sanctuary, the MPs said.  The UK has taken 1,000 refugees so far as part of a 20,000 five-year target.  But humanitarian campaigners say this is inadequate and that refugees already in Europe should qualify for resettlement under the UK's Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme, which is currently restricted to those in refugee camps in Syria and neighbouring countries.  Now, a campaign headed by Save The Children, urging the UK to give a safe haven to 3,000 unaccompanied children fleeing conflict in Syria, Iraq and other war zones has won the backing of MPs from all parties.  The cross-party committee commended the government's response so far to the refugee crisis, which it said was the worst since World War Two.  It praised the £1.1bn in humanitarian aid the UK had given to Syria and its neighbours to help the millions of people displaced by the civil war and challenged other wealthy countries to also meet their humanitarian pledges in full.  But it said more needed to be done, warning that 80% of children in Syria were in need of humanitarian assistance and the number of unaccompanied children ending up in Europe in search of safety was likely only to increase.  It was originally Save The Children which came up with the suggestion that Britain should take 3,000 Syrian children who had made it to Europe unaccompanied by adults. The charity pointed to statistics from the Italian authorities suggesting that up to 4,000 children had simply disappeared off the official radar in 2014. The fear is that these children may have been preyed upon by people-traffickers.  Previously, PM David Cameron has been set against resettling refugees from inside Europe, arguing that it is better to take people directly from the region around Syria. His logic is that if you take refugees from Europe, you might encourage more people to risk dangerous journeys in unseaworthy boats.  The UK has also given £1.1bn to the region to help improve conditions in camps near Syria's borders, in the hope that will help more refugees to stay nearer to home.  But it feels like political pressure is growing on the government to tweak its policy and to find more room for children who have already arrived on Europe's shores. Save The Children was heartened that the leader of the Liberal Democrats, Tim Farron, backed their proposal before Christmas.  The International Development Committee has now added its weight to the suggested plan. Officially, ministers say it is still "under discussion". They will be all too aware from an earlier episode in this crisis that photographs of vulnerable children can have a strong effect on public opinion.  Stephen Twigg, the Labour MP who chairs the committee, said it would welcome any commitment by ministers to meet the 3,000 figure.  "Children are clearly some of the most vulnerable refugees this crisis has created," he said. "The first refugee casualty of 2016 was a drowned two-year-old boy pulled from the sea off the Greek coast.  "Having survived the treacherous journey, there is a grave possibility that unaccompanied children become the victims of people traffickers who force them into prostitution, child labour and the drugs trade.  "This is an issue of utmost urgency."  The government has said Save the Children's proposal is "under discussion" as part of a wider review into the help given to orphans.  "What we are doing is looking at the issue of whether or not countries such as the United Kingdom should do more to help vulnerable children, particularly orphans, that arrive in Europe, as opposed to all the work we are doing to help vulnerable children in camps," a spokeswoman said.  Prime Minister David Cameron has insisted the UK's focus should continue to be on providing a "direct route" to safety for the most vulnerable Syrians and not to encourage them to make the dangerous journey across the Mediterranean by boat, which has seen hundreds perish.  As part of the UK's response, an additional 216 Syrian refugees were resettled under the VPR scheme between January 2014 and mid-2015, while the UK has also granted asylum or other forms of protection to 1,868 Syrians in the year ending September 2015.	politics
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35230069	CES 2016: Faraday Future shows off its concept car	A car firm hoping to disrupt the auto industry has shown off its first concept vehicle at the CES tech show.  Faraday Future said its battery-powered FFZero1 would project information over the driver's view and include a smartphone dock in its steering wheel.  The firm highlighted, however, that the modular basis of its design meant it could easily reconfigure the elements to create other types of electric vehicles including pick-up trucks.  But the company - which is backed by the Chinese internet TV provider LeTV - said it was on course to deliver its first production vehicle in two years time.  Its research chief Nick Sampson - who was formerly an engineer at rival electric car-maker Tesla - suggested his firm was able to move faster than others thanks to its adoption of "variable production architecture".  He explained this meant it would use the same basic underlying structure on all its vehicles, adapting it to include anywhere from one to four motors, battery packs of various sizes, different types of wheelbases and other optional parts.  This, he said, meant different models could be rolled out in a relatively short space of time - some perhaps prioritising range and others horsepower.  The company is on course to release its first production car in 2018, Mr Sampson added, and would break ground on its first factory, to be based near Las Vegas, within a few weeks.  Faraday Future has pledged to invest more than $1bn (£679m) in the plant and eventually employ more than 4,500 workers.  "The car's obviously very radical but that's what concepts are all about," commented Thilo Koslowski from the tech consultancy Gartner.  "I think Faraday has a good understanding of what it has to do in order to be successful. But we will have to see if it will be successful. I can tell you that the established vehicle manufacturers are not standing still either."  Scott Evans, associate editor at the Motor Trend news site, was more doubtful.  "Faraday Future claims to be disrupting the industry and completely rethinking the car, but is promising stuff everyone else is doing," he tweeted.  How many of these are intended to make it to market was unclear.  But its chief designer, Richard Kim, said its edged side - which he described as a "UFO line" - would feature in all Faraday Future vehicles to mark them out.  In time, the firm said it intended to build self-drive vehicles and would not only sell its cars but also provide "connected mobility" to the wider population.  "Electric mobility has been hampered by a lack of charging stations so Faraday Future has invested in a car sharing company," explained Alexander Renz from the consultancy Clareo.  "It is serious about going beyond car ownership.  "And the partnership with LeTV, which is the Netflix of China, is about seeing the car as a platform. In the future when cars will be driverless, people will need something to do."  The launch was slightly marred by several technical faults involving faulty teleprompters.  Potentially a bigger issue, however, was the Financial Times' spot that Faraday Future's chief battery architect had left after 15 months in the role. The company is only three months older than that.  Although Tesla is not attending CES, several other companies are expected to show off new electric concept vehicles of their own over the coming days including BMW, VW and Chevy.

uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35229346	Simon Danczuk admits receiving photo agency payment	Labour MP Simon Danczuk has admitted receiving £1,100 from a photo agency for pictures of him sold to tabloid newspapers and magazines.  Mr Danczuk told BBC Newsnight it was a properly declared payment for media advice and to "give ideas about what they might or might not do."  The Rochdale MP said he did not make any apologies for the arrangement.  FameFlynet describes itself as one of the most powerful photographic news agencies around the world.  Mr Danczuk said: "What I have done with that organisation is to provide media advice and give ideas about what they might or might not do and that's my choice if I want to do that type of work and I don't make any apologies for it.  "There's nothing against doing that. It provides insight, it provides some transparency in terms of my life, not anything that I have ever shied away from.  "I readily accept that I do media work of various kinds and that is all declared quite clearly in the register of members' interests."  FameFlynet said it "prides itself on helping people in the public eye to raise their media profile. We use the mainstream press to achieve this".  A spokesman said: "Our work is mainly done through clever PR and promotional activities. We do not hide this from anybody and stress to our clients that we all have to be transparent.  "Over the years we have been extremely successful in this work and feel our expertise is a benefit to our clients."  It is the latest twist in the furore surrounding Mr Danczuk, 49, who is fighting to save his career following revelations that he sent lewd messages to a 17-year-old woman.  In his Newsnight interview, Mr Danczuk apologised for his behaviour and blamed tabloid newspapers for blowing the story out of all proportion.  He said he feared his work campaigning against child sex abuse might be tarnished by the current stories around his private life but he admitted he had brought this upon himself by messaging the girl.  "It was inappropriate and I have apologised for that unreservedly. I think you have to see the context of this.  "This young woman got in touch with me some months ago, during the course of several months we had exchanges across social media, and just at a low point in my life in September she sent me some sexual texts and I responded accordingly and I shouldn't have responded. Wholly inappropriate, no doubt about that."  He added: "My credibility has been dented, I readily accept that, and I have to work harder than ever before to prove myself.  "There is a dramatic difference between what I have done, some sexting with a young woman above the legal age - nothing illegal - the police have said there is no case to answer.  "That is in sharp contrast to what I have always campaigned on, which is child sexual abuse of the most criminal nature."	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35228630	CES 2016: A look at the first tech announced in Vegas	It seems some people can't wait - the CES trade show doesn't officially start until Wednesday, when its giant exhibition floors open their doors.  But already tech firms great and small are firing out press releases and YouTube videos.  For smaller firms, announcing a product now represents an opportunity to beat the crush.  Start-ups that exhibited at CES's Eureka Park zone over the past four shows have collectively attracted more than $1bn (£680m) in investment since 2012, according to the event's organiser, so it's about more than just titillating the public.  But for the larger companies, revealing a product in advance might reflect the fact that it didn't quite make the cut to be spotlighted in one of the tightly-timed press conferences.  Either way, below are a few of the early announcements that caught our eye.  Fitness tech looks like being one of the show's big themes, and Technogym is looking to update its range of high-end gear with a treadmill that plays a "personalised music soundtrack" based on the speed the user is running at.  The firm says its system works by matching the rhythm of a song to the number of steps per minute it detects the person is jogging at. Spotify already does something similar with its app for street runners, but Technogym says it's the first to bring the idea to a treadmill.  Meanwhile, iFit has announced a treadmill of its own fitted with a 60in (1.52m) curved OLED screen. The company says it can use data from Google Maps to create the sensation of running in "exotic locations". Haters of vertical video better look away.  Adding big displays to appliances that seemed to do well enough without them looks like it will be another trend.  Samsung's latest fridge features a 21.5in high definition touchscreen that it says can be used to check its "temperature, humidity and operation mode" as well as to look at the food inside via a camera.  It will be interesting to find out which niche of the market Samsung thinks will take it as a preferable solution to simply opening the door.  The other big South Korean firm in attendance - LG - has released a deluge of early details.  Among them is news of a new line of smartphones called the K series.  The firm says they have been designed to look "far more expensive and exclusive than they really are" - which, you would have thought, as a marketing campaign might undermine their appeal.  Elsewhere, Acton - the maker of one of last year's most talked about products, RocketSkates - has revealed its latest product: an electronic skateboard.  The Blink is controlled via a small handheld device, although a smartphone app can be used as an alternative, and travels at up to 12mph (19 km/h).  With hoverboards banned from use on the CES showfloors, could this prove an acceptable alternative - or just fuel future safety fears?  For those who prefer to keep their feet on the ground, Digitsole wants to pitch you its smartshoe.  The footwear contains a toe-warming system, can count your steps and features a built-in torch lamp.  The French start-up describes its $450 (£305) shoes as being "trendy". We'll leave that to you to decide, but can't help wonder if people really want to have to recharge their clothing.  In drone-news, China's DJI has revealed a modest change to its line-up.  Its high-end Inspire 1 Pro now comes in black - great for those who like their unmanned aircraft to look that bit more menacing.  It also has a new version of the Phantom 3 that incorporates a 4K camera but has a less powerful data transmission system than the "professional" version of the drone.  As a consequence it can only be flown from up to 1.2km (0.75 miles) away instead of 5km (3.1 miles) - which from a safety point-of-view doesn't sound like a bad thing.  On the roads, Toyota has thrown in its lot with Ford and committed itself to adopting the SmartDeviceLink platform.  The system allows smartphones to connect to a vehicle's dashboard and represents an effort by the automakers to pursue their own technology rather than fitting Google or Apple's in-car alternatives.  Ford said Peugeot, Honda, Subaru and Mazda are also considering supporting SDL.  It's curious timing bearing in mind Ford is soon expected to announce a separate tie-up with Google to build driverless cars.  There's are also been a couple of wearables announcements.  Gymwatch has announced that its weightlifting-tracking wristband can now communicate with the Apple Watch - so, now you have an excuse to have glowing tech on both arms and not just one.  And just in case you thought smart glasses had gone away, Massachusetts-based Kopin has announced what it says is the world's smallest display for eyewear.  Whether that means many of us would need a pair of glasses to be able to look at our glasses remains to be seen.  Finally, for now, just in case you were worried Mr Tiddles was being left out, Petnet has unveiled the SmartBowl.  The firm says animal owners just need to input the weight, age and activity level of their cat or dog, and the bowl will tell them when they have poured in the right amount of food.  Just be prepared to put up with your newly food-limited pet begging for extra treats as a consequence.  Read more of our CES coverage and follow the BBC team covering the show on Twitter.	tech

Mr Benn opposed his party's leader in December to back UK air strikes in Syria.  "Is it best to have Hilary [Benn] in a job where he's going to disagree with Jeremy [Corbyn] again and again or should he be in one like Environment where they're in complete agreement?", Mr Livingstone told BBC News.

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35224859	Easy-to-use ransomware code discovered	Cyber-thieves have turned to web programming languages to create a cheap ransomware service.  On infected machines, ransomware encrypts data and frees it only when victims pay for it to be unscrambled.  Many gangs making ransomware keep the code for themselves, but Ransom32 is freely downloadable from one dark web site.  News site BleepingComputer said Windows users had been targeted by the malware over the Christmas period.  Ransom32 was designed for those that lacked the technological skill to create their own brands of malware, said Bleeping computer editor Lawrence Abrams.  The malicious program and its administration system are written in HTML, CSS and Javascript - languages more usually used to create mainstream websites. It is believed to be the first virus written with these languages.  The malware can be downloaded from the dark web by anyone who supplies a Bitcoin wallet number,  The malware's developers take a 25% cut of any ransom collected and forward the rest on to the Bitcoin wallet supplied.  Victims who unwittingly download the malware can be locked out of their computers and asked to pay a ransom in bitcoins to get back in.  The malware looks for and scrambles a huge variety of files including images, movies, documents and data archives.  Those who do not pay up could have their hard drives wiped.  Security expert Graham Cluley told the BBC: "By turning their ransomware into a sellable service, the criminals behind Ransom32 are providing an opportunity for other hackers to easily launch attacks that will encrypt users' documents, including personal photographs, movies and more."  "They demand payment via anonymous Bitcoin to ensure the safe return of the otherwise unrecoverable data."  Those who use Ransom32 control it via a basic administration panel, that allows them to configure the malware to their liking.  The bug's developers even offer them advice on fraud strategies, in one instance suggesting: "Don't be too greedy or people will not pay."  In a blog post, Fabian Wosar of security company Emsisoft said users' best line of defence was "a solid" strategy for backing up files.  That way, should the worst happen, they can recover data without having to pay the ransom.  Mr Cluley added: "Presently, the attack appears to have been distributed via email, so once again users are advised to exercise great caution over what they run on their computers - especially if it arrives via unsolicited email."	tech

It will be taking orders from 08:00 PCT (16:00 GMT) but has given no guidance on price or when it will ship units.  "We'll be sharing everything you need to know... on Wednesday," it said in a blog posting.  Pre-ordered devices will come bundled with video games Lucky's Tale and Eve: Valkyrie, free of charge.  Industry watchers are keen to learn the cost of the device, which is not expected to be aimed at casual users.  In May, Oculus boss Brendan Iribe said a Rift and a PC capable of powering it should cost $1,500 (£1,000) in total. The firm has said the finished consumer-ready headset should be in the "same ballpark" as the $350 cost of its earlier prototypes.  Before now Oculus has only released prototypes of its headset, which promises users "immersive" video gaming experiences.  Facebook, which bought Oculus for $2bn in 2014, said it planned to expand the use of its technologies, to include "communications, media and entertainment, education and other areas".  It said the firm's founder, Palmer Luckey, would be answering questions about the Rift on a Reddit Q&A session on Wednesday at 18:00 PCT.  The firm hinted it would be make provide more updates this week, adding "We can't wait to share what's coming next!"	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35217418	David Cameron: We'll directly commission 13,000 new homes	The government is "pulling out all the stops" by directly commissioning the building of up to 13,000 homes on public land, ministers say.  Smaller developers will be able to buy sites in England with planning permission in place - with 40% of the new-builds to be so-called "starter homes" aimed at first-time buyers.  PM David Cameron said it was a "huge shift in government policy".  But Labour said he was using "rhetoric to hide his failure on new homes".  Shadow housing minister John Healey said the announcement did not promise new investment or affordable homes beyond those already announced.  Direct commissioning allows the government to assume responsibility for developing land, instead of large building firms.  Communities Secretary Greg Clark told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government was "pulling out all the stops to get the country building".  "We know that consistently 90% of people aspire to own their own home, and for many years now home ownership has been in decline," he said.  He added that the eight biggest building firms accounted for 50% of the house-building market, and there was a need to involve smaller and medium-sized companies.  Downing Street said the move marked a "radical new policy shift", with up to 13,000 homes set to be built on five publicly-owned sites in 2016 - with up to 40% being affordable "starter" homes.  In December 2014 former Lib Dem chief secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander announced a pilot plan for the government to "directly commission, build and even sell homes" at a former RAF base in Northstowe, Cambridgeshire.  BBC home editor Mark Easton said the extent of government involvement marked something of an ideological shift for a Conservative administration, adding that starting 13,000 homes represented a "tiny proportion" of the million the government wants built by 2020.  The government wants to build 200,000 starter homes - to be offered to first-time buyers under 40 at a minimum 20% discount price - by 2020.  The discounts apply to properties worth up to £250,000 outside London, or £450,000 in the capital.  A pilot for the scheme will start on five sites:  Where can I afford to live?  Critics of the starter homes scheme say they are still too expensive for many people to afford.  Speaking on a visit to a housing development in Barking Riverside, east London, Mr Cameron said affordable housing was "a house that someone can afford to buy or afford to rent".  "Sometimes I think we get too hung up on these definitions," he said.  "There are hundreds of thousands of Londoners in their 20s, 30s, sometimes in their 40s, who are living in rented accommodation who would love to be able to own their own homes."  The CBI said the announcement "should be a real spur to our ability to build more homes". Housing charity Shelter said it was a "welcome step" but added that starter homes "simply won't be affordable to the vast majority of people in this country".  The government will also announce a £1.2bn fund to help developers prepare underused brownfield land for building.  The move will fast-track the creation of at least 30,000 new starter homes by 2020, Downing Street said.  Shadow housing minister John Healey told BBC News: "If new announcements built new homes, the government would have solved the housing crisis by now."  He described it as a "drop in the ocean" compared with the number of homes needed.  Labour said home ownership was at its "lowest level in a generation".  Mr Healey added: "In the Autumn Statement a few weeks ago, George Osborne tried to spin his halving of public housing investment as an increase. Now David Cameron is laying on the rhetoric to hide his failure on new homes."	politics

Another influential MP told BBC Newsnight the party's leader was guilty of "low-level non-violent misogyny".  Jeremy Corbyn has come under fire for appointing men to all three shadow "great offices of state" - chancellor, foreign secretary and home secretary.  He is under pressure to give more top roles to women in a reshuffle this week  Forty-three per cent of Labour's MPs are female, but the party leader, deputy leader, chair and London mayoral candidates are all male.  Speaking to BBC Newsnight Harriet Harman, who was acting Labour leader for four months after the party lost the 2015 election, said: "We can't have a men-only leadership when we are party for women and equality.  "Women expect to see men and women working together and we can't have an all-male leadership again and therefore we need to change the rules."  Jeremy Corbyn is believed to have started talks with shadow cabinet members as part of a reshuffle. Existing shadow cabinet members who are reportedly under threat include defence secretary Maria Eagle and chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton.  Jess Phillips, who was elected for Birmingham Yardley in 2015, has also criticised Mr Corbyn for failing to put women in senior positions.  "Had Tony Blair not given any of top jobs to the women - had that same make-up of his team existed - people would rightly have been up in arms," she told BBC Newsnight.  "But it's a bit like some people in the Labour Party are accepting low-level non-violent misogyny because it's Jeremy doing it."  She said she would be prepared to run for the leadership herself at a later date. "It's not something I'm planning on doing anytime soon, but it's absolutely something that I would do in the future."  In another intervention on the issue, Dawn Butler, who chairs the women's Parliamentary Labour Party, said she was concerned about the impact of forthcoming boundary changes on female MPs.  "We can't afford to lose women because it's a fight. My fear is that women will be picked off so I've written to the leader and deputy leader because Tom [Watson] is doing a review and it's a huge worry for me."  A report released last month by the Fabian Society criticised the Labour Party for "poor representation of women at all levels". Women make up 44% of Labour's membership and 43% of Labour's MPs, but just 30% of constituency Labour Party chairs and 16% of Labour council leaders.  Women also account for only 11% of the most senior Labour Party staff.  The same survey also found that women standing for selection as Labour parliamentary candidates were almost three times more likely than men to be asked questions relating to their gender.

In which case, I have to admit a failure.  It's important to point out that I wasn't wholly to blame, what with the government taking me to court and all that.  Nonetheless what I've finally learned isn't a story now - and probably wouldn't have been when I thought it might have been.  Four years ago, I asked what I thought was an entirely innocent question using Freedom of Information laws.  Back in 2010, the coalition government were trumpeting a new red tape-busting cabinet panel, the Reducing Regulation Committee. I suspected that it was all froth and no action, so in 2012 I asked how often they had met since the committee's creation.  Twenty working days later, I thought, I'd get a number closely resembling one, namely the original meeting. How wrong I was, on both fronts.  The Cabinet Office, bored rigid I can only assume, decided to refuse my request on the basis that disclosing the number would impinge on cabinet collective decision-making. Balderdash I thought, or some other word beginning with B.  I therefore appealed, first to the Cabinet Office's own system (turned down) and then to the Information Commissioner's Office. Merry hell ensued. The ICO found in my favour, the Cabinet Office appealed, lost, appealed again, won, the ICO appealed for me, won, etc. Back and forth it went for three years. At one point, the government called in the fearsome-sounding "Treasury Devil", the so-called Star of the Bar, James Eadie QC, to argue their case.  Every few months a kindly solicitor at the ICO's office would email me with the latest twist in a story I had long lost interest in beyond knowing the indefatigable team at the ICO's office were sticking to their guns.  In November, word reached me that the end was nigh. A hapless Cabinet Office official was roundly condemned by a tribunal, who described her evidence as evasive and disingenuous.  Despite my increasing confidence that I'd get my answer, it was still something of a miracle to receive the response from the Cabinet Office on the Friday just before Christmas.  I'm now in a position to exclusively reveal to you, dear reader, that between 2010 and 2012, the Reducing Regulation Committee met on a total of 13 occasions.  You read it here first. Eventually.  Ministers are currently pondering whether to put restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act. In the meantime, how much it cost in legal fees to refuse my request for three years will be the subject of my next FOI request.	politics

technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35221689	Net reaches new addressing scheme milestone	Efforts to convert net users to a new addressing scheme have hit a key milestone.  The novel scheme is needed to help the net support more users and many more smart devices and gadgets.  Now more than 10% of net users are visiting websites using the new system, statistics suggest.  Called IPv6, the protocol replaces an the older version whose pool of addresses is almost depleted.  The figures were gathered by search giant Google, which monitors how people reach its services.  The adoption of IPv6 around the world is patchy, as some nations have deployed it widely while others have ignored it.  Belgium tops the table of most enthusiastic IPv6 adopters, as 44.3% of people in that country can use it to get at Google and other IPv6 sites. Adoption in the US is 25.6% and the UK 2.95%.  The net has grown largely on the back of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which can support a total of four billion addresses.  But the massive growth of the net has meant almost all of these older identifiers have now been used up.  Everything connected to the net needs an address to ensure that data reaches the right destination.  The basic syntax of Internet Protocol version 6 was first agreed 20 years ago, but only in December 2015 did use of it hit 10%, according to Google's figures.  Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, said now that IPv4 had run out, many people were taking IPv6 a lot more seriously.  "Major sites such as Facebook and Google have adopted IPv6, and pretty much any web site could be using IPv6 now," he told the BBC.  "This means that people that have IPv6 on their devices, as well as IPv4, can now use IPv6 in preference."  Mobile networks are among the biggest users of IPv6, because most modern smartphones are equipped for it.  The vast majority of people online still connect via IPv4, and some ISPs use technology in their networks to translate between the two.  Some are pushing on with projects to convert their networks to IPv6 - in the UK, BT has said its entire network will be able to use IPv6 by the end of 2016.  Running both IPv4 and IPv6 had its problems, said Mr Kennard, though few noticed it as the basic tasks of visiting websites were rarely affected by the internal technology.  "However, sharing IPv4 addresses does stifle innovation and development of new applications and protocols," he said.  "Eventually IPv4 will be some obscure legacy thing, still lingering on a bit," he added. "Sadly, we are probably many years away from that."	tech

It estimated just 13 million would have the required graphics capabilities in 2016, rising to 100 million by 2020.  Consumers can access VR on smartphones and consoles, but need PCs to use high-end headsets such as the Oculus Rift.  Some forecasts have suggested 2016 could be the year VR finally takes off.  VR headsets create immersive 3D environments wearers can interact with and explore. But despite growing excitement about their potential, they have yet to reach a wider consumer audience.  However, providers such as Facebook's Oculus and HTC are preparing to ship their first headsets by spring.  And VR companies feature prominently at the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which opens in Las Vegas on Monday.  But Jason Paul, general manager of Nvidia's VR business unit, said most computers required a "sevenfold increase in raw performance" to work properly with the best headsets.  "Immersive VR requires seven times the graphics processing power compared to traditional 3D applications and games."  This is because below-par processing can lead to jerky, unsatisfying images.  Oculus recommends owners of its Rift device have a PC with a powerful graphics card, such as the Nvidia GeForce 970 or AMD Radeon 290.  They also need an Intel i5-class processor, more than 8GB of memory, and two USB 3.0 ports - all of which pushes up the price of a PC considerably.  Chris Hall, editor at Pocket-lint.com, told the BBC: "For many households, the recent trend for PCs has been power efficiency and reduction in size for greater mobility, meaning they may not have the power for the best VR experiences."  He added: "PC gamers may have the power, but for the casual VR user, that might mean a hefty investment if they want to adopt the first wave of new consumer VR products."  But Rock, Paper, Shotgun editor Jeremy Laird told the BBC: "Very high-end cards or PCs are already pretty good for VR.  "So something like an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 is probably reasonably VR capable.  "By the end of 2016, that kind of performance should be a lot more affordable as the next generation of graphics cards is phased in."  Research company IHS has estimated seven million VR headsets will be in use by the end of 2016.  And Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said in November he expected the VR market would "take a while to pick up momentum".  While the company expects to ship the first orders of the Oculus Rift headset in March, it last week delayed the release of its Touch controller until the second quarter.  Initial orders will come with an Xbox One wireless controller instead.	tech
uk_politics	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-35221168	New minimum wage could mean fewer pay rises	Politicians must act to make sure a higher minimum wage does not leave thousands stuck for years on the lowest possible pay, according to the Resolution Foundation.  In cities like Sheffield and Hull almost a third of workers can expect higher wages, the living standards think-tank says.  But it fears that could see "one wage towns" where employers cope with higher salaries for their most junior staff by failing to put up pay for more experienced workers.  The Office for Budget Responsibility has said the policy could cost 60,000 jobs.  Paul Harrison, managing director of Sheffield coach firm Central Travel, told the Today programme: "I believe long term we'll probably have to lay people off unless we can put up prices with schools and colleges."  The minimum wage for over-25s will be raised to around £9 by 2020. The Treasury describes this as a National Living Wage.  The Resolution Foundation was mentioned by the Chancellor George Osborne when he announced the higher wage in the summer budget.  It wants city regions that are to be given extra powers - like Manchester and Sheffield - to help businesses with planning and skills shortages.  The Foundation's head Torsten Bell said many firms didn't know how to respond, and local politicians needed to take action.  He said: "They should be focusing on raising awareness in local businesses in their area, particularly in those businesses most affected."  A government spokeswoman said: "The independent Office for Budget Responsibility expects the National Living Wage to cost business just 1% of corporate profits. This will be offset by cutting corporation tax to 18% and reducing national insurance contributions for smaller firms."  Several large employers including Sainsbury's and Lidl have pledged to put up pay before the new rules come in.	politics

In a Facebook post, he said his personal challenge this year would be to build a "simple AI" like Jarvis from Hollywood blockbuster film Iron Man, referring to the AI butler.  Mr Zuckerberg plans to share his progress over the course of the year.  Last month, he made headlines for plans to donate 99% of his stake in Facebook.  He had to defend his philanthropic venture -launched to celebrate the birth of his daughter- after critics argued that it could provide a way for the founder to avoid paying tax on the sale of his shares.  On Monday, Mr Zuckerberg said he would start to build the AI with technology that is already out there and teach it to understand his voice to control everything in his home from music and lights to temperature.  "I'll teach it to let friends in by looking at their faces when they ring the doorbell," he said.  "I'll teach it to let me know if anything is going on in Max's (his daughter's) room that I need to check on when I'm not with her."  For Facebook, he added that the system would help him visualize data in virtual reality and help him build better services, as well as lead his company.  His announcement comes as Facebook is in the midst of AI initiatives such as building an assistant through its Messenger app for users.  The tech billionaire said a part of the motivation behind this year's challenge was the reward of building things yourself.  His previous personal challenges have included learning Mandarin, reading two books a month and meeting a new person everyday, he said.	tech

Maria Miller, chair of the Commons Women and Equalities committee, said a person's sex was "not relevant" on official documents, and it created an "unconscious bias" in job applications.  Gender details on passports also do not assist with identification, she added.  The committee will publish a report on transgender discrimination next week.  In an interview with the Times newspaper, Ms Miller said gender stereotyping can be as "damaging" for men as women.  "For individuals who have decided to transition but haven't necessarily got the right documentation, it can cause problems," she said.  "Why do we need gender on our driving licence? Why do we have to have it on our passport if it doesn't really aid identification? It's not relevant.  "Australia has decided to degender their passports."  Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said his party had pushed for the change during the coalition government's term in office.

All the BBC's websites were unavailable for several hours on New Year's Eve after what a BBC source described as a "distributed denial of service" attack.  The group, calling itself New World Hacking, said it had carried out the attack as a "test of its capabilities".  The BBC has not confirmed or denied such an attack caused the problems.  The corporation's press office said on Saturday that the BBC would not be commenting on the group's claim.  A "distributed denial of service" attack, which the group claims it carried out, aims to knock a site offline by swamping it with more traffic than it can handle.  In a tweet to BBC technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones, the group said: "We are based in the US, but we strive to take down Isis [IS] affiliated websites, also Isis members.  What is a "distributed denial of service" attack?  "We realise sometimes what we do is not always the right choice, but without cyber hackers... who is there to fight off online terrorists?  "The reason we really targeted [the] BBC is because we wanted to see our actual server power."  Earlier, New World Hacking had said: "It was only a test, we didn't exactly plan to take it down for multiple hours. Our servers are quite strong."  One of the group's members - nicknamed Ownz - told the BBC that New World Hacking was a team of 12 people - eight male and four female - who came together in 2012.  The group's other recent activities included taking part in a campaign against the Ku Klux Klan, and the #OpParis effort to identify and report IS social media accounts following the November attacks on the French capital, Ownz said.  Ownz said his group used a tool called Bangstresser - created by another US-based "hacktivist" - to direct a flood of traffic against the BBC, and had supplemented the attack with requests from its own personal computer servers.  The group has already used the technique against IS websites, but intended to "really get into the action" against a new list of targets associated with the militant Islamist group from Tuesday, Ownz claimed.  The problems on the BBC sites began at about 07:00 GMT on Thursday, and meant visitors saw an error message instead of the intended content.  The attack hit the main BBC website as well as associated services including the iPlayer catch-up service and iPlayer Radio app.  An initial statement tweeted by the BBC blamed the problems on a "technical issue". The corporation said it was working to make sites, services and pages reachable again.  By 10:30 GMT the site was largely working again although some pages and indexes took longer than normal to load.  At midday on Thursday, the BBC said its websites were now "operating normally", and apologised for any inconvenience caused.	tech

The Triby can receive picture messages, make phone calls and answer questions you ask it.  It is the first third-party device to feature Alexa.  BBC's technology desk editor Leo Kelion asked the company's chief Serge Renouade why anyone would need such a gadget in their lives.	tech

A 'smart button' designed to control all of a home's internet-connected appliances has been developed by a French start-up.  The makers of Concierge say the button can switch off the lights, start the dishwasher and water the garden when you leave the house, all with one press.  But it does not come cheap - the company expects it to cost €170 ($185; £124).  The BBC's Leo Kelion asked the company's project officer, Antoine Georglin, what a physical button could do that a smartphone app could not.	tech
technology	http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35192737	CES 2016: Preview of the Las Vegas tech showcase	Across the globe, tech industry insiders are charging their batteries and taking a deep breath.  CES kicks off next week - a sprawling consumer technology showcase that seems to extend to more Las Vegas venues every year.  From Samsung to one-person start-ups, thousands of companies will demo new products, while, behind-the-scenes, deals will be struck to make further generations of gadgets possible.  "Every CES is fresh and different, and we try to see what the future will bring," the event's organiser Gary Shapiro says.  "What I've learned is that sometimes the companies themselves don't even know if they're going to get their product finished in time."  VHS recorders, HD TVs, the Xbox games console and Blu-ray discs all made their debut at past shows.  But one expert suggests the tech giants may temper their ambitions this time round.  "Say goodbye to cool, say hello to practical," explains John Curran from the consultancy Accenture.  "Many of the larger companies now put less emphasis on CES as a launch pad for major hardware. So, they will focus instead on showing off new services to help garner excitement for existing products.  "But for the smaller businesses this is as big a venue as they are going to be able to find and is an excellent opportunity to catch the eye of journalists and key buyers from the retailers."  New TV tech always makes a stir at CES, even if some of the innovations are not always practical.  In recent years, Samsung and LG have slugged it out to boast the biggest sets, but this year it may be about having the bendiest.  LG made headlines in May when it showed off an ultra-thin prototype that could be peeled off the wall - it will be fascinating to see how much further the two South Korean firms have developed the concept.  As far as screens you might actually want to buy soon, expect the focus on be on "HDR".  The acronym refers to high dynamic range, and basically means that TVs can show millions more shades of colour and a wider dynamic range - added shades of brightness in between black and white - letting more detail be shown.  Amazon actually started streaming some of its shows in HDR this year, but competing standards meant the TV-makers hadn't put their marketing muscle behind the format.  That's likely to change at CES when a coalition of the leading players reveal a new specification. It will let them badge TVs to show they will support future HDR-coded content.  That should prevent an embarrassing repeat of the fact that many of the early 4K sets ended up being incompatible with the way ultra high definition video is now streamed.  Netflix had previously said it was waiting until this moment to start supporting HDR - expect its chief executive Reed Hastings to reveal more at his keynote CES speech.  And while it's likely to be many years before the mainstream broadcasters adopt HDR, several of the movie studios have said they will offer it on 4K Blu-ray discs - the first players are also expected to be unveiled at CES.  The action camera-maker has promised to launch a drone called Karma in 2016.  Rumours suggest it could deliver 360-degree views and incorporate collision-avoidance tech  The firm's chief executive Nicholas Woodman is speaking at a dinner event, but it's still unclear if he'll offer a first peek at the aircraft.  Even if GoPro holds fire, there are dozens of other firms set to show off flying tech, including:  Britain's Intelligent Energy will also be showing off a hydrogen fuel cell, which it says lets drones stay airborne for hours, rather than minutes, at a time.  Chip-makers Intel and Qualcomm will try to explain why adopting their rival drone technologies could give manufacturers an edge.  And the Federal Aviation Administration has a booth and will likely provide an update on its new register for US-based drone owners.  Following years of hype, 2016 looks to be the year that virtual reality becomes - well, reality.  HTC is inviting select journalists to take a look at its revamped Vive VR headset on Monday.  The headset - created in conjunction with video games firm Valve - was supposed to have gone on sale by now.  However, the Taiwanese firm delayed the launch to add what it says is a "very big technological breakthrough".  Is it eye-tracking sensors, a way to get rid of its external wiring or something else? We'll soon know.  Sony is set to follow with its own press conference on Tuesday when we should get more details of the PlayStation VR - the add-on headset for its bestselling console.  But one company watcher thinks the Japanese firm will miss a trick if it doesn't make another VR-centric announcement.  "Sony should come out with an accessory to convert its Z5 Premium smartphone into a VR solution," says Ben Wood from consultants CCS Insight.  "Its 4K screen is a solution looking for a problem - its high resolution really would lend itself to the experience."  Oculus has already carried out a similar trick for Samsung's phones, but its focus this time will be on the Rift.  The Facebook-owned business recently confirmed the PC-powered VR headset is "on-target" for a Q1 launch.  With pre-orders about to begin, surely it's time to find out how much it will cost.  There should also be news about "affordable" 360-degree cameras - if VR is going to take off beyond gaming, people need an easy way to record their own videos.  In addition, keep an ear out for new audio-recording equipment capable of matching sounds to a VR user's point-of-view - France's Arkamys has already teased one solution that will be on show.  The Consumer Technology Association is talking up this category, noting there's 71% more space dedicated to robots than in 2015.  Few think robots are ready to go mainstream just yet, but there's still several companies worth keeping an eye on.  The US start-up Jibo is creating a lot of buzz after its "social robot" raised over $3.7m (£2.5m) on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. The project's chief, Cynthia Breazeal, will be popping into town to provide an update.  There are a couple of new droids from France - the Buddy companion bot (which you can see at the top of this article) and Leka, a machine designed to stimulate children with autism and other developmental disorders.  And from Japan, Flower Robotics promises to bring "beauty" to the field by showing off robots designed to be as aesthetically pleasing as they are useful.  You might appreciate its efforts in the future, when squadrons of the automatons are zipping about.  As we career towards roads full of self-driving, electric-powered vehicles, the automakers are embracing CES as a chance to reveal their latest innovations.  Ten of the big-name car manufacturers are exhibiting this year, but much of the pre-show buzz is being generated by a Chinese firm looking to disrupt the sector.  Faraday Future has promised to unveil a "concept" that will help "define the future of mobility".  The company has already lured several executives away from Tesla, announced plans to build a state-of-the-art factory near Las Vegas, and received backing from China's tech billionaire Jia Yueting. We'll learn more at its event on Monday.  Volkswagen will hope to steer back attention the next day - and repair its battered reputation - when its chief executive takes to the stage.  The firm has said it will have a new concept vehicle to show off - rumours suggest it will be an electric Microbus capable of driving up to 500km (310 miles) on a single charge.  Ford's boss, Mark Fields, is also in attendance. It's been reported that he's working on a tie-up with Google to create a new self-driving car business.  But it's not clear whether this will feature in his CES presentation or be kept back for the Detroit Auto Show later in the month.  BMW, however, has already confirmed it will be demonstrating Air Touch - a control mechanism for its in-car maps and entertainment systems that 3D-scans hand gestures to let drivers avoid having to fumble for buttons.  And Toyota is promising to show off a new "high-precision" road imaging system that will let self-driving cars share what they've seen to keep their maps up to date.  The technology may do away with the need to send out special vehicles equipped with expensive laser scanners to get the data.  "There'll also be more than 100 smaller auto tech companies," adds Accenture's John Curran.  "This year's focus will be a little bit less on infotainment and more on security and safety - so, we should see new collision avoidance technologies, anti-car jacking tech and ways for cars to communicate with each other."  Despite smartwatches gaining ground in 2015, Fitbit and its fitness trackers remain wearable tech's bestselling brand.  The firm has an early-morning press conference on Tuesday, suggesting it has something major to reveal.  "We could see a revision of Fitbit devices and software to better track stress via heart rate variability and skin temperature, along with software that offers coaching for better sleep and stress management," predicts Charles Anderson from the investment bank Dougherty & Company.  "We also expect to see Fitbit in more pacts with fashion brands."  The firm's activity-logging rival Misfit is also at CES. The business was recently taken over by the watch giant Fossil, and we may see the first fruits of their tie-up.  Chinese tech giant Huawei is tipped to unveil a smartwatch targeted at women and smaller start-ups are also expected to unveil female-friendly wrist-wear.  "There's been a very male bias to wearable tech but you're going to see what I call the jewellification of this stuff," predicts CCS Insight's Ben Wood.  "There's a big gap in the market - wearables for women will be a big theme."  Of course, another theme will be wearables that don't call attention to themselves, at least not until needed.  For instance, the French firm Atol will be showing normal looking glasses that tell a smartphone app where they are when lost.  In&motion has what it says is the world's first "smart airbag" for skiers - a vest that inflates in less than a tenth of a second upon impact.  And Digitsole has new shoes that tie up their own laces - something we've been waiting for ever since Back to the Future II.  Wearable tech for pets is also set to become more subtle.  PitPat, for instance, has a fairly unobtrusive activity tracker for dogs - a far cry from some of the more clunky animal-centric efforts seen at past CES shows.  L'Oreal is back for a second year with a new mystery product following the success of its Makeup Genius app in 2015.  Another French firm, Romy, is in town with a device that custom-mixes skincare ingredients to suit each user at different times of the day.  And the UK's Amirose is pitching in to offer special cucumber-enhanced eye pads said to be specially formulated to soothe "computer eyes".  There should also be a plethora of products that promise to aid longer-term benefits.  For instance, Ceracor will debut a sensor that measures the level of haemoglobin in the blood, which it says athletes can use to boost their endurance.  And Skulpt is showing off Chisel, a device that it says can be used to measure body fat and muscle quality.  As ever with health tech, some of the claims will need to be put under scrutiny.  Canada's Medical Wearable Solutions, for example, will have to justify its boast that its EyeForcer glasses are the solution to "the epidemic of Gameboy disease".  Also look out for an explosion in the number of products targeted at new parents, including a sensor that measures contractions, telling mothers when to go to hospital, and a smart changing pad that tracks the growth of newborns.  Four million UK households already contain some sort of smart home system, according to a recent report by Strategy Analytics.  Nest and Philips paved the way, expect a fresh flood of internet-connected thermostats, lights, fire alarms and plug sockets at the show - as well as new ways to control them.  Samsung has said it intends to make its next range of Smart TVs double as command-and-control "smart hubs", while LG has pre-announced the SmartThinQ Hub - a cylindrical device that does much the same thing.  If at this point you are trying to stifle a yawn, hold on - there are a few products in this category that intrigue.  The man who developed the original iMovie for Apple has turned his attention to laundry and will unveil a washing/drying machine called Marathon at Monday's CES Unveiled preview.  The device can be set to keep clothes locked inside until their rightful owner returns - although how many flatshares will be able to afford its $1,200 (£810) price is another matter.  Invoxia will be showing off Triby - a connected-kitchen product powered by Amazon's voice-activated assistant Alexa.  And there will also be other new kit to enhance the home including a showerhead that tracks how much water it has used, a module that lets you control gas fireplaces from your phone and a sofa that vibrates in time with shows on TV.  It's been said that it's a heck of a lot easier to get an overview of CES from outside Vegas rather than trying to tramp around its epic-sized show floors.  We'll certainly try to highlight the key announcements as well as some of the more weird and quirky reveals.  You can follow the news via our special CES index and we'll also post highlights to our Facebook page.

In a new year message, the PM said he was determined to "secure our future" with the EU referendum, which could be held this year.  Jeremy Corbyn said 2016 would mark the "start of the journey" towards a Labour government.  In his new year's message, the Labour leader pledged to fight austerity.  Leaders of other political parties have also issued new year messages. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said 2016 would be "a year of optimism", while Nigel Farage tweeted: "Let's make 2016 the year that the UK votes to leave the European Union."  Mr Corbyn, who has faced criticism from some MPs since winning the leadership election in September, said he was elected "on a mandate for change".  With his first major electoral tests looming in May's local and devolved administration elections, he said his party would "offer a real alternative: a politics that gives people a say in the decisions that affect them, and an economy based on long-term investment, instead of self-defeating austerity".  The Labour leader said he would tackle David Cameron's government "much more" on cuts to local councils and lack of investment.  Mr Cameron said some people choose to "shout into megaphones, wave banners and sign petitions".  He added: "But we're the ones who are able to make the arguments and take the difficult decisions in order to defeat these social scourges and deliver real security. So while others are on protest marches, we remain on the long walk to a greater Britain."  He promised "real social renewal" in tackling poverty and improving social mobility, repeated pledges on house-building and said the government would "respond with vigour" to an extremism review later in the year.  Tim Farron used his first New Year's message as Liberal Democrat leader to criticise Labour and the Tories for being divided.  He criticised government cuts to Universal Credit and policing and said more should be done to support refugees fleeing Syria.  Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted 2016 to be "a year of optimism and ambition" with supporting enterprise and innovation in public services her priority, while leaders of Scottish Labour and the Scottish Green Party set their sights on May's Holyrood elections.  Leaders of Wales' four political parties also looked ahead to the 2016 elections, with Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood pledging to travel the "length and breadth" of the country and making the case for her party.  Green Party leader Natalie Bennett said the membership of her party had more than trebled in 2015, and she was determined to turn the "Green surge into Green votes" this year.	politics
