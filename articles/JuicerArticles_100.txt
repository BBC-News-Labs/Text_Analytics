It may no longer be “America’s game” at the turnstiles or in the ratings, but baseball has always ruled on the big-screen. Hundreds of baseball movies have been made, and they number among the best sports movies ever.Maybe there’s something inherently relatable about baseball players. They don’t have to be seven-feet tall or 300-plus pounds. You wouldn’t find a physique like David Wells or Prince Fielder in any other sport, except maybe golf… or bowling.And the almost cosmic intangibility of the sport – dependent as it is on “breaks” – lends itself to bigger thoughts about life. Or maybe to a stray fastball in the groin. Whatever.On the occasion of the upcoming Blue Jays home opener, here’s an entirely subjective list of best, worsts and random observations about assorted baseball movies.Kevin Costner. He starred in arguably the best sports movie of all time, 1988’s Bull Durham and cemented his rep as the “baseball guy” the next year with Field of Dreams. He returned to the diamond in 1999 in Sam Raimi’s For the Love of the Game playing a pitcher whose last start, a nothing game against the Yankees, turns into one for the ages (punctuated by flashbacks). By accounts, Costner was a pretty good high school pitcher, too.Charlie Sheen in Major League (1989). As Ricky “Wild Thing” Vaughn, he took to the field like a gladiator with The Troggs’ biggest hit as a theme song, leaving everyone within 30 feet of the plate trembling in fear of something “just a little outside.” He’s everybody's favourite Wild Thing, except in Toronto, where Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams gave up the Series-winning homer to Joe Carter.Anthony Perkins as Jimmy Piersall in 1957’S Fear Strikes Out. Excellent movie. Should have hired a stunt double though. Runners up: John Goodman as Babe Ruth in The Babe (1992) and – I’m gonna say it – Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees (1942).Brendan Fraser in The Scout. Widely considered one of the worst baseball movies ever. Released, appropriately enough, during the 1994 strike season.Animals playing baseball. We’re speaking specifically of Bud the golden retriever in Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch (2002) and Ed, the chimp in 1996’s Ed (for identification purposes, Ed’s co-star Matt Leblanc was the one who spoke words).From Moneyball. “An ugly girlfriend means no confidence, OK? I’m just saying, we are trying to replace Giambi and this guy’s girlfriend is a six at best.”A KID SAID THAT IN A FAMILY COMEDY? MAN, THE ‘70s WERE A DIFFERENT TIME:“All we got on this team are a buncha Jews, s---, n----, pansies, and a booger-eatin' moron!” Jackie Earle Haley as Tanner Boyle in The Bad News Bears (1976).Tommy Lee Jones as Ty Cobb in Cobb (1994). As miserable an interviewee as Jones is, there may be ex-sportswriters still alive who can confirm that the Georgia Peach was a sumbitch on a whole other level.To Fever Pitch (2005), in which Jimmy Fallon learns to give up all hope of the Red Sox winning a Series and give in to loving Drew Barrymore. Except that the Curse of the Bambino was finally broken after principle filming ended and they had to frantically reshoot the ending.STILL SOLID ADVICE – I’M LOOKING AT YOU, JETER:“There’s no crying in baseball!” Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own (1992).WHAT PART OF ‘THERE’S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL’ DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?:Bang The Drum Slowly (1973), with Michael Moriarty and Robert De Niro as best-friend battery mates. Next to Brian’s Song, the #2 movie guys can’t watch without getting something in their eye.Robert Redford as 35-year-old rookie Roy Hobbs in The Natural (1984). Dennis Quaid as real-life 35-year-old rookie Jim Morris in The Rookie (2002).Making the baseball-obsessed J.D. Salinger-esque author in the book Shoeless Joe into a black character (James Earl Jones) in Field of Dreams. You guys do know that was Jim Crow baseball, right?MOST UNDERRATED BASEBALL MOVIE (OR WHAT’S A SCANDAL WITHOUT CHARLIE SHEEN?):Eight Men Out (1988), John Sayles’ movie about the Black Sox scandal, featured Sheen as Happy Felsch, John Cusack as Buck Weaver, a young Michael Rooker (The Walking Dead) as Chick Gandil and D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe Jackson. Cool flick.Robert De Niro is the title character in 1996’s The Fan (a knife salesman no less) who stalks newly-acquired San Francisco Giant Wesley Snipes. Yikes.YOU NEVER SAW IT, AND THEY NEVER WENT ANYWHERE:Million Dollar Arm (2014), the true story of a sports agent (Jon Hamm) who signed two Indian cricket players to minor league baseball contracts.
Three indigenous languages still spoken in Canada are among a group being studied as researchers attempt to understand how children around the world learn their vastly different mother tongues.The global project — spearheaded by the University of Zurich — is looking at Dene, East Cree, and Inuktitut among 10 languages.Researchers already know that children have little problem learning to speak their native language. What's not well understood is exactly how this happens."We're trying to get a real sense of how children can acquire or learn any language in the world," Dagmar Jung, a senior researcher from the University of Zurich, said in an interview."It's a miracle that any child can actually learn any language it's exposed to when it's young."As part of the study, Jung and Olga Lovick, an associate linguistics professor at the First Nations University of Canada, were heading to the Clearwater River Dene Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday.It's one of only three places in the world where children grow up speaking Dene.About 7,000 languages are spoken around the world but most research to date has focused on the structurally similar large European languages."The question is how do kids go about learning a language that is structurally so different as Dene?" Jung said from Regina.Jung, who plans an initial two-month stay with the Clearwater River Dene, and Lovick plan to train community members to record children of two or three years old and to write down what they say over the next year.Lovick will help co-ordinate the research, which will involve Dene language experts, research and recording assistants, as well as participating families.At one point, Canada was home to more than 70 distinct First Nations languages. Recent figures suggest about a dozen have disappeared altogether and the others — with few exceptions — are extremely endangered."By our being there and fostering this interest in children learning the language, we're hoping that maybe this will remind people how important it is to speak Dene to their kids so that they keep learning Dene," Lovick said. "In many other places it's too late."One aim of the research is to identify ways to teach First Nations languages more effectively to adults."We know how hard they are to learn as adults," Jung said. "So everybody is actually really excited to see finally how children do it because we just don't know how to do it easily."One idea — currently being challenged — is that children's brains have a "hard-wired" grammar module called Universal Grammar from which all human languages can be derived.Another idea is that learning a language relies on general cognitive mechanisms.Much of the initial research on Inuktitut and East Cree is already underway or been done.The other languages in the study are Turkish, Japanese, Russian, Sesotho, which is spoken in southern Africa, Yucatec Maya in Mexico, Chintang in Nepal, and Indonesian.
Taraji P. Henson knows it’s not her roles in The Karate Kid remake or Think Like A Man Too that brought her to the Saturday Night Live stage. She’s there because of the instant breakout of primetime soap opera, Empire and a certain loud and proud character named Cookie Lyons, a woman who hasn’t met a scene she couldn’t steal.But, it turns out Cookie couldn’t stay the whole night (she only appeared in one digital short) so her alter ego Henson was upstaged by Kate McKinnon in almost every single sketch.This is how the cookie crumbled.Hillary Clinton (Kate McKinnon) attempts to come off as warm and friendly while recording a video message declaring her candidacy for president. Instead, she has trouble unfreezing her face from a terrifying grin and shouts “Citizens! You will elect me as your leader!” The best part of this sketch was when former SNL star (and current announcer) Darrell Hammond walked in the shot to reprise his classic Bill Clinton impersonation. The real Bill and Hillary back on the campaign trail and Hammond back as the skirt-chasing ex-president. Everything old is new again – and it’s kind of cool.Henson waits until her second sentence before mentioning Cookie, so that shows some restraint. From there, the rest of the monologue is a souped-up, over-the-top show-stopper with Henson singing about how she’s “made it,” backed up with a full gospel choir. Yes, Taraji, you’ve made it. But you’re also a little pitchy. Nothing those Empire producers can’t fix with some Auto-Tune.McKinnon takes the lead again – this time as a loopy Liza Minnelli-type designer hawking a line of red, sparkly ponchos on shopping channel QVC. She claims the over-sized smocks can be worn three different ways – just don’t ask her what they are. After using a model (Aidy Bryant) to demonstrate that the poncho can be worn normally (that’s the first look) or stretched to the side to expose one shoulder (that’s the second) – she zones out and spends the rest of the segment cluelessly talking to unsatisfied customers on speakerphone while the host (Henson) tries to jog her memory.In a rip-off of A League of Their Own, the all-female and all-white baseball team balks at the thought of letting a black female (Henson) join the lineup. When Leslie Jones’ character (also black but bigger and taller with braided hair) inquires about joining, she’s met with looks of terror. Whoa. That’s a lot of race commentary crammed into such a short sketch, and that line about sending Jones’ character “overseas to kill some Krauts” was just mean. It got exactly zero laughs, too. Which is exactly the right amount.Henson comes to Sesame Street as her Empire character Cookie to tell off Ernie, intimidate Mr. Snuffleupagus and Big Bird, take cookies from Cookie Monster and…um…turn Elmo into a red fur coat. The Muppets were good sports about this one.With the release of their new album Wilder Mind, British band Mumford & Sons shows off their more guitar-heavy sound playing The Wolf as their first song, which is a burst of energy from start to finish and really gives their drummer a workout. They choose the slow-build Believe the second time out.
THE Corrs are mourning the death of their father who passed away after suffering a heart attack.It’s understood Gerry Corr, who lived in their native Dundalk, Co Louth, had a heart attack last Sunday and was taken to the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin before passing away on Thursday.His friend Fr Michael Cusack described Mr Corr, who was in his early seventies, as a man of “great faith” who was adored by his children.“I’m very sad to hear of his loss and so will his children be, they all adored him.“He was a very kind and decent man,” he said.Mr Corr’s wife Jean passed away in 1999 aged 57 from a lung condition.His removal will take place on Monday at 11.30am to The Church Of The Holy Redeemer in Dundalk for funeral mass followed by burial at St Patrick’s cemetery.
Holocaust survivor Heinrich Rotmensch returns to the concentration camp were 70 years ago he escaped from hours before he was due to die.Survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp near the eastern German city of Weimar gathered on Saturday to commemorate the camp's liberation by American soldiers on 11 April, 1945.Among them was Rotmensch, who spent more than seven years in various concentration camps until the end of World War II.“I grew up in concentration camps and spent time in eight of them,” he said.“I was transferred from the Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp in Poland to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. And then I was transferred to a small town in Tuttlingen.”A local German, Rotmensch studied, played, lived and grew up just like any other German children until his family’s Jewish identity was revealed.Taken by the Nazi SS when he was just 15-years-old, Rotmensch never saw his parents again.Years later, he learned that his mother died in the gas chambers of the Auschwitz, while his father was shot dead by the Nazis army. His body was never found.His elder brother survived at the camp, but died later died in war in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.Read More: Survivors recall Buchenwald horrorsRotmensch and many others were rescued by the French Army after it marched into Germany."The French controlled the whole train as we were being sent to the execution site. Fortunately, we ran into the French Army and got saved," he said.Praying for his parents and brothers in Hebrew in front of the Monument to the Jewish Victims at the Buchenwald concentration camp, Rotmensch said that Germany had done well reflecting its Nazi history.
A motion for a disaffiliation vote will be submitted Tuesday during a special general assembly.In an interview with le Soleil, the CEGEP student association’s spokesperson Antoine Godin-Landry said that 200 students have signed a petition circulating since March seeking to disaffiliate.Last week, students at Cégep Garneau voted nearly 70 per cent against a strike day to allow its members to attend a protest in Montreal.Following the resignation — and subsequent symbolic firing — of ASSÉ’s executive last weekend, the group reiterated the necessity of continuing their fight against austerity measures, fossil fuels and “political repression.”ASSÉ’s executive was removed after distributing a text proposing a strategic break from striking to better coordinate with labour unions in the fall.
North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda West Indies and England face off in the first Test of a three-match series at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Monday, with both sides involved in reconstruction and rehabilitation following a wretched few months.Facing the wrath of the Indian authorities following an unprecedented abandonment of the tour there last October and with several of their star players either overlooked by the selectors or unwilling to represent the regional team, there is considerable trepidation over the prospects of the West Indies in the opening fixture, notwithstanding the ground's reputation as a batting paradise.Chris Gayle, who led the West Indies to an upset 1-0 triumph the last time England played a Test series in the Caribbean in 2009, announced his unavailability for the assignment, although he is turning out for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League.Dwayne Bravo, captain of the squad who walked out of the Indian campaign, appears to be paying the price for his role in that fiasco, although the official line from the selectors, headed by outstanding former captain Clive Lloyd, is that they are looking to younger players to try to take the team forward.While the West Indies were at least able to qualify from their preliminary group at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand last month, England failed to advance beyond the group stage, inviting widespread condemnation at home and at the same time fuelling speculation over the possible return of controversial batsman Kevin Pietersen for the Ashes series against arch-rivals Australia in three months' time.One batsman who is expected to make a return in Antigua is Jonathan Trott.Seemingly lost to the game when leaving the last Ashes series in Australia after struggling to cope with the pace of Mitchell Johnson in the first Test in Brisbane, the 33-year-old South African-born player looks set to open the batting in his 50th Test with captain Alastair Cook.Without a century for his country in more than a year-and-a-half, Cook is likely to attract almost forensic attention, both for his leadership and form with the bat, as England embark on an arduous campaign of 17 Tests over a nine-month period.Rustiness will also be a concern as their last Test was more than eight months ago when they completed a 3-1 home series demolition of a dispirited Indian side.Their brief build-up to this series was hardly taxing as the couple of two-day matches against a St Kitts Invitational XI provided such a low standard of opposition that the tourists resorted to using some of their squad players in the home team for the second match.However the game unfolds, England and their army of travelling supporters are anticipating at least one moment of celebration as experienced seam and swing bowler James Anderson needs four wickets in his 100th Test to surpass celebrated all-rounder Ian Botham's tally of 383 – the most by an England cricketer in Tests.Ironically, Anderson and the rest of the England pace attack are being mentored on this tour by fast bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who was surprisingly removed as head coach of the West Indies just a couple of days before the home series against Bangladesh last August.Former hard-hitting West Indies opener Phil Simmons, previously in charge of Ireland, was only announced two weeks ago as Gibson's full-time replacement.Simmons has been preparing the squad at a training camp in Antigua where the continuing good form of Devendra Bishoo looks certain to result in the return of the leg-spinner to the Test fold three years after his last match against Australia in Barbados.Home captain Denesh Ramdin has spoken of relying on spinners to win the series for him, raising the prospect of a final XI including both Bishoo and left-armer Sulieman Benn.That would leave Kemar Roach and Jerome Taylor, the destroyer of England in the decisive first Test in Jamaica in 2009, as the twin spearheads of a bowling attack that will be seeking to exploit and magnify any self-doubt among opponents who inevitably have one eye on their impending home duel with the Australians.
We are far from being done, even though it feels like we are. It is a huge relief and a boost to our morale and sense of accomplishment that the…
Lagos Mainland Rep-elect Jide Jimoh on Sunday blamed poor political education by INEC for the low turnout of voters in Saturday’s Governorship/House of Assembly elections.Jimoh told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that INEC’s inadequate time for electioneering also contributed to the voter apathy recorded in the poll.“It takes two to tango, the electoral officers must also embark on proper enlightenment, political parties must also intensify their enlightenment and campaign.“Voting is voluntary, you cannot coerce people to go out and vote; someone may have his permanent voter card and decide to keep it at home,’’ he said.The elected legislator added that: “For the fact that people have not come out to vote is not a crime, we just have to encourage people.’’He also stressed the need for government to improve much more on the provision of infrastructure and empowerment so that dividends of democracy will ginger and encourage people to vote.The rep-elect noted that the period of campaign should not be too close, saying that the period for campaign in this country is too short.“In U.S., you have up to three months for campaign before elections; in Nigeria, it is a few weeks you have left to campaign.’’He called for the review of the relevant laws, saying that the number of months for campaign should be increased for future elections.Jimoh, however, commended INEC for improving on its performance in the March 28 elections, noting the conduct of the governorship and state Houses of Assembly election was much better.“I tell you that there are some improvements which I observed in the conduct of this election, compared with the fortnight’s exercise.“For instance, the INEC personnel have improved much more on the use and workings of smart card readers,’’ he said.On the use of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and card readers, Jimoh said it was a welcome development for this country.He urged the electoral commission to retain the use of the card readers in future elections and improve on them.“It has reduced drastically the number of fraudulent activities where in those days you see a local government bring outrageous votes.“The system ensures that voters must be seen and identified physically which made manipulation of figures difficult.’’The rep- elect, who attributed his success to God’s work and the love by the people, urged Nigerians to live up to their responsibilities in the governance of the country.

BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is The Vaccines singer Justin Young.Young is a Manchester United fan whose favourite player, David Beckham, influenced him in more ways than one."David Beckham was a great 'hair-spiration' for me as a boy, and an inspiration on and off the field too," he told BBC Sport."Eric Cantona and Peter Schmeichel were my other favourite players but Beckham was my number one."Without a doubt my favourite Beckham haircut was the Brylcreem-era curtains and I still haven't stopped trying to emulate them."A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, with one perfect score.His score of seven points was beaten by darts legend Phil 'The Power' Taylor, who also picked five correct results, but with two perfect scores. That gave the 16-time world champion a total of nine points.Lawro also made a prediction for Aston Villa's rearranged game with QPR on Wednesday. He went for a 2-0 Villa win but did not pick up any extra points because the game finished 3-3.We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.Manchester United are on a very good run and their fans are suddenly all shouting about how they are going to finish above Manchester City.On current form, it looks like they might be right because United have been playing very well in recent weeks. City, clearly, have not.The biggest problem for the defending champions is that they have been too easy to play against and, therefore, too easy to beat.But this is a huge game for them and I think we will see City's big players like Yaya Toure rise to the occasion. They have done that enough times at Old Trafford in the recent past - City have won on their last three visits.I am expecting a closer encounter this time and I think it is going to end in a draw after an open game.Justin's prediction: David De Gea is perhaps the best keeper in the world on his day. He's one of the main reasons we are where we are. I'm a massive Wayne Rooney fan and I've really enjoyed seeing Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini come good under Louis van Gaal, because I wasn't their biggest fan before.I think next year will be an important year for us, this season we just need to get in the top four and I think United will win. 4-0Liverpool got themselves over the line and to Wembley after beating Blackburn in their FA Cup quarter-final tie and that success will help their league form too.I can only see one outcome at Anfield on Monday, because Newcastle's poor form means they are the team everyone wants to play right now.Fourth place has gone for Liverpool but their aim now has to be to finish in fifth, get to the FA Cup final and try to win it.Do that, and they have had a good season.* Does not include scores for postponed game - Leicester v Chelsea
Tuen Mun Town Plaza recently caught the eyes of many as radical protesters against parallel trading clashed with mainland visitors and police in the biggest shopping mall in the northwestern New Territories.One popular way for local residents or shoppers from across the border to get to the mall is by taking the light railway to Pui To stop.Many may not know that Pui To is not just the name of a nearby road. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, a Buddhist monk named Pui To came to Tuen Mun from India. He is believed to be the first monk to have brought Buddhism here.I'm no expert on Buddhism and this column is not going to focus on the history of this great religion. It's just that few people realise that Pui To is linked to tycoon Li Ka-shing's decision to finance the construction of the just completed Tsz Shan Monastery in Tai Po.While the media reported widely on the private bullet-proof safe house and meditation room for Li, visitors to the Tang dynasty-style temple, which opens to the public on Wednesday, will hopefully find tranquility of nature and soul rather than thinking about the various stories surrounding Li and his intentions in donating HK$1.5 billion for the project.Li initiated the idea more than 10 years ago because he felt there was too much negative sentiment in the city. In the epilogue of a book on the construction of the monastery, Li wrote: "There is a precious pearl deep in everyone's heart. As long as you can find it, your heart will be enlightened. The issue is 'have you found it'?"Walter Ngai Kai-shu, the monastery's secretary general, explained a new way to worship at the facility. Visitors, he said, would be asked to put a bowl of water into a giant vat rather than burning incense as in many other temples. It is said that what Hong Kong now needs is water to cool down the heat in our midst.This seems all very Buddhist, but like it or not, this city certainly needs more cool heads to forge greater tolerance and harmony, as political controversy, social inequality and intensifying Hong Kong-mainland tension take hold.Religion is not supposed to be a cure for everything, but calmness and peace of mind certainly help. Take tourism as an example. Hongkongers started complaining when too many mainland visitors arrived. But over the Easter holidays, when there were fewer mainlanders, the tourism sector bemoaned a loss of business.The question of how Hong Kong can sustain its attraction to mainland spenders while curbing parallel trading is a complicated issue which needs deep reflection not only by the tourism sector and the government, but also the community as a whole.When Pui To first came to Hong Kong more than 1,500 years ago, Tuen Mun was a remote area. He could not have imagined what Hong Kong would look like today and what frustrations and difficulties Hongkongers would face. But the Buddhist theory of karma - that there is a relationship of cause and effect in everything - remains inspiring. Hong Kong's tomorrow is in the hands of our actions today.

I recently visited a ‘head shop’, one of many totally legal establishments now flourishing on British high streets, where users of officially illegal drugs may buy the equipment they need to enjoy their criminal habit.I didn’t buy anything. But one of the items on sale was a wall-clock, especially designed to be used to store drugs. ‘Hide your stash in plain sight!’ said the little poster next to it.It is good advice. If you really want to conceal something, leave it lying about where everyone can see it.This is what the Prime Minister has done with his supposed promise to hold a referendum on British membership of the European Union.The dishonest trick at the heart of the offer is so blazingly obvious that nobody notices it.Let me explain. If Mr Cameron really believed that he would win a parliamentary majority on May 7, he would not make this promise.He loves the EU so much that he has said that he wants to extend it to the Ural mountains. He absolutely does not want this country to leave it.But because Mr Cameron knows perfectly well that he will not win such a majority, and that no possible coalition partner or ally would support such a referendum, he feels safe to make a pledge that will never be redeemed.The purpose of the pledge is to win back some of those voters he and his Blairite friends have long derided as fruitcakes and closet racists. He despises them, but he wants their support to ensure that the Tories are the largest party, and that he stays in office.It would be disastrous for him if they all took him too literally. He needs some of them, but not all of them.This is perhaps why the Tory Party’s campaign is so crude, narrow and awful, almost designed to repel thinking and decent people.The interesting thing about all this is that it is so blatant, yet nobody seems to notice it, just as they don’t notice the perilous state of our economy (another disastrous balance of payments deficit was announced last week).And just as it is obvious that, while we are supposed to have ‘tough’ and ‘draconian’ laws on drugs, shops which help people take drugs thrive all over the country. I sometimes wonder if, one dark and tear-stained morning, all these many lies will be brutally exposed in one dreadful awakening.Winning at any cost? It's the only Game in townWhen I rather guiltily read the books on which the TV series Game Of Thrones is based, I was struck by one thing. The whole point of this saga is that ruthlessness pays, that evil generally wins, that justice is non-existent, and utter cynicism the only wisdom. It is the Middle Ages without the saving grace of Christianity.The whole idea is symbolised by the ghastly Iron Throne for which the various factions and clans compete, and which, once gained, eats into the souls of all who sit on it.I won’t watch the TV version because I very much do not want to see a slick and well-acted portrayal of such foul behaviour. But the success of this drama suggests that this sort of merciless immorality now has a wide and receptive audience. Gleeful, unembarrassed ruthlessness, once rightly kept in check, has become normal among us, and Game Of Thrones is a success because this change is now more or less complete.Political campaigning has played its part in this. I first noticed really dirty tricks in the 1997 campaign, when New Labour screened a particularly vile anti-Tory broadcast personally mocking Tory politicians and conference representatives, and falsely alleging a plan to ‘abolish the old age pension’.Once, this sort of thing was left to underlings and backstairs-crawlers who could be disowned. But now it seems to have become central. The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, is a senior Cabinet Minister and an experienced grey head in the Tory Party. I rather like him. But his outburst against Ed Miliband, accusing him of stabbing his brother in the back, and planning to do the same to the country, was a departure from the old rules of gentlemanly combat.It was also inaccurate, as Mr Miliband stabbed his brother in the front, openly campaigning against him in an election – more than can be said for the Tories, who deviously overthrew Iain Duncan Smith in a cruel and personalised putsch.But perhaps the most tricky and ruthless political act of the week came from the Blair creature, who ‘supported’ Mr Miliband on the European issue. How can this ghastly, discredited man not know that his kiss is the kiss of death? Of course he does.Compared with Blair’s embrace, a stab in the back would be an act of kindness.You shouldn't make it upThe story of how the young Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret mingled incognito with VE Night revellers is a moving and very British episode.So why must the makers of a new film, claiming to be about the event, fabricate falsehoods about the King’s daughters going to brothels and gambling dens, and Princess Margaret getting drunk?I suppose that having got away with the multiple untruths in The King’s Speech, the movie industry felt that invention was better box office than truth.And yes, I know Shakespeare made things up, too. But this stuff isn’t Shakespeare.The devastating attack no one heardIn a grown-up campaign, last week’s attack on David Cameron by a former British ambassador to Syria would have been devastating. As it is, it seems to have passed almost without notice.Here’s a flavour of the indictment levelled by Peter Ford, Our Man in Damascus from 2003 to 2006.‘If Cameron had his way, the jihadists could have been in control of Damascus by now,’ and, ‘To call for the overthrow of the secular Syrian government, to demonise it out of all proportion… to predict its imminent fall… and then to wail as though it was nothing to do with them when British Muslims set off to help hasten said overthrow is inconsistent and nonsensical.’I couldn’t agree more, and still can’t understand how he gets away with it.Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Cameron go around the country eating bacon sandwiches and hot dogs with knives and forks to avoid embarrassing photos.
The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose.Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days.Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah – a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher – has been charged with her murder.Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'.Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user – and that her whole family were addicted to the drug.But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts.He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.'The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction – but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years.He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.'And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.'He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him.And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana.Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS.Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally.On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days.But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked.On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery.Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information.Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.
A leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.Tom O’Carroll, a former Open University information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE, attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation.The organisation, set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, is campaigning against what it sees as the ‘biased and unfair’ Independent Press Standards Organisation.It wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry.The news that O’Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group.PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL).The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child 'understood the nature of the act' and apparently consented.The group also wanted incest to be legalised.O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee. The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ‘corrupting public morals’.He wrote a blog after the February meeting, chaired by comedian John Cleese, confirming his attendance.A Hacked Off spokesman said that the meeting was ‘open to and free for all members of the public to attend’.

A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday.Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source.The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place.Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family.Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine.One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts.His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search.At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis.He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff.The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body.Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way.Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him.'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started.'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis.'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.'He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old.'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell.'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.'Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family.'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon.'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it.'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.'Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk.The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages.David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014.On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'.Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad – they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named.They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.'Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.'An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before.'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'
The 52-year-old has replaced Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins as most likely to take on the role, according to bookies. Philip is best known for starring as the rough-and-ready DCI Gene Hunt, the politically-incorrect detective from the BBC police drama. Odds have been slashed from 10-1 to 2-1 after The Sun on Sunday reported that the BBC are considering hiring the actor-turned-presenter. The BBC declined to comment on the speculation.Philip is a vocal car enthusiast and is about to present the second series of For The Love Of Cars on Channel Four David Williams of Ladbrokes said: "All of a sudden Glenister is the hottest name around. "We hadn't seen a penny for him before the weekend but in next to no time he's the new favourite. Punters seem convinced that something is afoot." Simon Clare, spokesman for Coral, said they have slashed their bets from 10/1 to 2/1 for Glenister. "We have seen a host of celebrities gambled on in recent weeks to take over from Clarkson and it is rapidly becoming one of the biggest novelty betting events ever", he said.Behind Philip, Great British Bake Off star Sue Perkins is the next favourite at 4-1 followed by Dermot O'Leary who has recently quit X Factor at 5-1. Jeremy was the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him in a 30-second assault on March 4. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. Last week, the disgraced 55-year-old pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You. The future of the show's other two presenters – Richard Hammond and James May – is also unclear, with both men's Top Gear contracts having run out.
MOTORISTS heading to and from the city centre have been caught up in large traffic jams today as work continues on new road crossings at one of Hull's busiest junctions.Drivers faced delays with queues stretching along Beverley Road, Spring Bank and Ferensway as a road improvement scheme entered its final phase.One motorist told the Mail how a journey from Mytongate to Beverley Road took half an hour this morning when it normally takes five minutes.Improvements to the junction linking Beverley Road and Ferensway with Spring Bank and Freetown Way started on January 19 and the 12-week project is scheduled for completion this month.However, with contractors avoiding work at the site during peak morning and evening rush-hour times, more work has to be done over the weekend.Another driver, Ian Shenton, 49, told how he was caught up in traffic jams in Beverley Road as he attempted to reach East Park."It took me a good 20 minutes to finally get through the lights," said Mr Shenton, of east Hull. "I can understand them wanting to do as much as they can over the weekend when it's less busy but I think everyone will be glad when the road works are finished."On Saturday, bus company EYMS diverted buses away from Beverley Road to Princes Avenue to avoid the tailbacks.The road works have included larger traffic islands for pedestrians wishing to cross the junction, the installation of new wheelchair-friendly crossing points and new paving for people with sight problems.The 20-year-old traffic signals and underground electrical equipment have been renewed with repairs to the surfaces of the main approach roads.

Lovebirds Ian and Susan Goodwin on board their houseboat, SpadgerWidowed boaters Sue Boyce and Ian Goodwin had given up on finding love after losing their partners to illness.But romance blossomed for the couple after Ian told a pal: “What I really need is a bereaved boater.”The pair both got together when they met on the waterway in Llangollen – famous for the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.“Lots of my friends knew lots of Ian’s friends but we did not know each other,” Sue said.“For some reason, we had never met. I was talking to a friend of mine in my local pub and he said it was really difficult dating when you got older.“Ian had lost his wife and lived on a narrow boat, a life most people do not understand and he said to my friend ‘What I could do with is a bereaved boater,’” Sue said.“And I walked past. My friend waved me in and introduced us.”The pair married in St Collen’s Church, Llangollen, last month.10 things to see and do around LlangollenThey were racing against the clock to marry in the town as canal rules meant they had to leave by April 1.Sue wore a green dress while Ian was dapper in a charcoal grey suit.She fell for the retired computer programmer because he is “very patient and he’s good fun”.“We both thought we had found our soulmates and then we lost them,” the 57-year-old said.“The older you get the more difficult relationships are. It’s more difficult to gel.”Ian and Sue became friends before they fell in love.45 lakes, rivers and canals that make Wales look like heaven on earth“We did some boating together and got to know each other,” Sue said.Ian proposed on December 27 while they were watching a band called Roving Crows in Llangollen’s Sun Inn. The vicar who married them was pulling pints that night.“They have a song called ‘Woman After My Own Heart,’” Sue said.“In that there is a line that says ‘Sail away with me.’ Ian stood on the stage and said ‘Sail away and marry me.’”“Everyone in the room knew what was going to happen apart from me,” Sue said.The group announced to cheers: “If anyone missed that, Ian just proposed!”“A moment or two later I said, ‘Yes!’” Sue said.Marriage was not always on the cards for the lovebirds, who now live together on Ian’s boat, Spadger.“At first, she didn’t want to know me,” Ian said. “But after a while, she accepted my presence. I think she was just playing hard to get. That’s my take on it.”“That was in separate boats,” Ian said. “Half-way around she abandoned her boat and got on mine. The rest is history.”The dad-of-three and stepdad-of-four never thought he would find love again after losing his wife, Penny.“I had given up really,” the 63-year-old said.“I thought ‘I’m not going to find a boater.’“And then a mutual friend said, ‘Well, we know someone, it’s Sue.’“Two minutes later she came into the pub. It was like destiny.”Neither expects the other to forget their late partners.“Sue was engaged to be married and her chap sadly passed away after a massive heart attack,” Liverpool-born Ian said.“I lost my wife to pancreatic cancer. Neither of us will forget our late partners. That is a good thing and we both understand it. And with us both being boaters, it is a lot for us to have in common.”
Panama City: Hillary Clinton would be an "excellent president", US President Barack Obama said on Saturday, a day before his former secretary of state is expected to announce her campaign for the White House in 2016."She was a formidable candidate in 2008, she was a great supporter of mine in the general election, she was an outstanding secretary of state, she is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president," Mr Obama said during a news conference at the Americas summit in Panama City.Mr Obama said when Mrs Clinton makes her bid public, he expects "she will be very clear about her vision for the country moving forward".He lauded her foreign policy as the top US diplomat during his first term in office."She's going to be able to handle herself really well in any conversations that take place around foreign policy," he said, adding: "her track record with respect to domestic policy is, I think, one that cares about working families."Mrs Clinton plans to announce her long-anticipated plans through video and social media on Sunday before travelling to key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a Democrat close to the Clinton camp.Mr Obama, asked about the possibility of US Vice-President Joe Biden running to succeed him, demurred."Not only have I run in my last election, I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections," he said.
Leader of the defunct Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), Chief Ateke Tom, has said former militant leaders in the region are ready to cooperate and work with the President-Elect, General Muhammadu Buhari.Ateke, who disclosed this while speaking to newsmen at Okochiri community in Okrika local government area of Rivers State, urged Buhari to invite leaders of genuine militant camps in the Niger Delta region to discuss on how to move the region forward.He said, “I am here to congratulate Buhari for his victory. We will want good leadership; we thank God that Buhari is now our President and we pray God Almighty to give him wisdom to rule our country. Since Buhari is now our President, we want him to meet with the core leaders of the Niger Delta struggle; I mean the real leaders in the struggle.“He should call the real leaders and talk to them. Let us discuss on our needs. He should also not forget the Amnesty Programme, because we know what we fought for and that was why they gave us Amnesty. We did not get the Amnesty Programme from the backyard. So, let him keep to the programme. Let the Amnesty Programme function well and we will like it. We are ready to work with Buhari.”The former militant leader said none of the former agitators in the region will go back to the creeks or blow up pipelines as threatened by some activists in the region recently, due to the defeat of President Goodluck Jonathan in the just concluded Presidential election in the country.Ateke said, “Some people are saying they want to go back to the creek, or they want to blow up pipelines; no, I, Ateke Tom will not be part of that, we don’t need all those things and nobody will go back to the creeks. I have a say in the Niger Delta and I am one of the top fighters; so nobody will go back to the creeks. I advice the youths not to follow anybody back to the creeks.“We should not say because there is change of government and Buhari is now the President, and somebody wants to go back to the creeks; what are you going there to do? So, let nobody follow anybody to the creeks. What we want is that let Buhari meet us and treat us well.“We cannot say because Jonathan, our brother is the President and therefore under his administration, every programme and policies that were mapped out for the Niger Delta by Yar’adua before his death, have all been implemented by the Jonathan government; no. There are some of the programmes and policies that have not been implemented, and we expect Buhari to implement them when he finally takes over as President.”
Too often matters have been discussed behind closed doors. Too often in its recent past the council has chosen secrecy over openness and accountability.Earlier this year, we revealed almost one in five of the council’s decisions in 2014 were made behind closed doors.As part of the Mercury and Sunday Tasmanian’s Your Right to Know campaign, state political editor Matt Smith requested, through Right to Information legislation, the details of expense claims for Hobart’s elected members.MORE: WHY THIS PLACE IS A MONEY PITThe outcomes ran as a special investigation in yesterday’s Sunday Tasmanian and continue today.They revealed aldermen had claimed a total of $135,000 in personal expenses since 2012.We must be clear: there is no suggestion elected members have done anything illegal or in breach of council guidelines. But the investigation has raised significant questions about these very guidelines and the subsequent processes and accountability.Many of the claims had no explanation of why they were needed. Several did not have accompanying work receipts.The documents provided to this newspaper did not include expenses incurred by aldermen which are paid for directly by the council or on other corporate credit cards.We argue that the very fact journalists were forced to use RTI legislation to access what should be basic details of council spending is absurd.At the end of the day, we are talking about ratepayers’ money. Your money.The council now has a new regime and the opportunity to break down the barriers of the past. To set a fresh course. New Lord Mayor Sue Hickey has spoken about the need for greater transparency.Arguably her biggest opponent on the council, Marti Zucco, has said the same thing. There is clearly an acknowledgment there is a problem and a mood for change.In the wake of the investigation, Ald Hickey has called for a review of the council expenses process which has been started by general manager Nick Heath.This will look closely at the process which Mr Heath describes as one of “self-certification”, whereby elected members are not required to obtain council approval before making purchases and receipts are “not required but are often provided and obvious discrepancies are queried”.He has discussed the matter with the Auditor-General.Tonight the council will vote on several motions to open up its processes, including public reporting of elected members’ expenses and monthly publication of these details on the council’s website.This comes in the wake of a council motion earlier this year to suspend its policy on financial assistance for developers — following the Myer fiasco — while it works on a more transparent way to deal with investors; and demand that local government candidates across the state disclose campaign donations.The council is starting to say the right things about opening up. But the Your Right to Know investigation highlights one undeniable point: the time for talk is over.
“The abuse she has suffered left her mentally and physically traumatised,” Canadian-based aid worker Yousif Daoud, who recently returned from the region, told The Toronto Star.“This girl is so young she could die if she delivers a baby. Even caesarean section is dangerous.”The girl, a member of the persecuted Yazidi Christian minority, has been flown out of Iraq by a Kurdish aid agency and is receiving treatment in Germany.Daoud said the girl was found in “very bad shape”.“She was sexually abused by no fewer than 10 men. Most of them were frontline fighters or suicide bombers who are given girls as a reward,” he said.ISIS released more than 200 Yazidis on Wednesday, mostly women and children, after holding them captive for eight months.Daoud said ISIS released the abused women and girls “to shame the whole community”. He said the victims faced the humiliation of lost chastity.The news comes as IS militants are holding hostage at least 50 civilians, almost half of them women, seized in a raid on a village in central Syria.They were kidnapped from the village of Mabujeh in Hama province on March 31, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.News of the kidnappings had been kept quiet because of ongoing negotiations for their release, but the talks have since faltered, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.Ten of those taken, including six women, are Ismailis, a minority sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The remaining 40 are Sunni Muslims, including at least 15 women.“There are fears that the women are being taken as slaves,” Abdel Rahman told AFP.He said the Ismailis were kidnapped because IS considers them “infidels,” and that the Sunnis — although from the same sect as IS fighters — were taken because IS viewed them as “loyal to the Ismailis”.Mabujeh, east of the provincial capital Hama, has a population of Sunnis, Ismailis and Alawites, another offshoot of Shiite Islam that is the sect of President Bashar al-Assad and his clan.
Kevin Pietersen announced himself with a century – what else? - on the first day of the rest of his life at The Parks.England's celebrity Test discard had not reached three figures in any form of cricket since he saved the follow-on against Australia at Old Trafford in August 2013.But he made shelling peas and pinching sweets off kids in the playground look like hard labour as he cruised to a 110-ball hundred against Oxford University as he launched his bid for a fairytale Ashes encore this summer.And on the eve of England's first Test against the West Indies in Antigua, he could not have chosen a better time to flex his muscles and let the selectors know he is still around.Pietersen's last appearance in whites, against a red ball, was in January last year as England curled up their toes inside three days in Sydney, the final act of a 5-0 whitewash for which he was cast as scapegoat.But he pulled in the crowds and took to challenging early-season conditions like a duck to orange sauce as he rescued Surrey from their stumble to 78-4 against the students.Scapegoat: Pietersen was made one of the scapegoats for the Ashes whitewashGive or take posh twits jumping off Magdalen Bridge on May Day, Pietersen's return to action attracted the biggest crowd at Oxford University this year.Circumspect at first, KP eased through the gears without crunching the clutch once. The only time he was caught with his trousers down was to replace his thigh pad.Coming in at 31-2 in the 10th over, after business management studies undergraduate Sam Weller had removed both openers, Pietersen's march to the crease was greeted by ripples of warm applause.On a ground where he scored 62 for Notinghamshire in an early-season warm-up 11 years ago, he took eight balls to get off the mark.Determined: Pietersen with coach Graham Ford in the nets before the gameAnd thrill-seekers had to wait 45 minutes for KP to hoist off-spinner Jack McIver to the ropes at long-off for the first of his 14 boundaries.But once he had had whipped left-arm seamer Jack Grundy through midwicket with his signature flamingo stroke, it was like rolling back the plaudits to an age before Textgate and incendiary autobiographies.Once he had reached his half-century off 63 balls, Pietersen's innings became increasingly agricultural, twice clearing the keeper and slips with premeditated mows intended for cow corner.But there were also snapshots of his thrilling power, one cover drive knocking an elderly spectator off his fishing chair. There are probably hanging judges who would haul KP up before the beak at Lord's for less.One of the first players on the ground, shortly after 9am, Pietersen – as ever – was instantly recognisable.While the rest of his team-mates warmed up in regulation black training gear, KP added a cable-knit sleeveless sweater and woollen beanie hat.And at the crease, the luminous green stickers on his bat, and fluorescent orange flashes on the heels of his boots, could have brought a jumbo jet in to land on a foggy night.Before tea, with Surrey recovering on 220-5, it was not the first time he would stand out from the crowd.
But at least three other Tasmanian towns have water that cannot be consumed because of heavy metal contamination.The extent of lead contamination in some North-East areas will be revealed at a public meeting on April 21 at Pioneer — one of five towns on a “Do Not Consume” alert.Macquarie University professor Mark Taylor and researcher Paul Harvey will attend the meeting to detail results of a study to be published in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal.The results will relate to tap water, natural water and infrastructure in the Pioneer, Ringarooma and Gladstone areas.At Winnaleah, TasWater is working with the Department of Health and Human Services to determine whether a filtration system could provide fully treated water.The trial centres on a mobile nanofiltration membrane plant, a Tasmanian first, TasWater works delivery general manager Dr Dharma Dharmabalan said.“Much of the community has been unhappy with the taste and appearance of the previous alternative water supply, and following community consultation, and with the guidance from the [DHHS], in November 2014 we reinstated the bore system with a ‘Do Not Consume’ alert.”There are 27 towns with Boil Water or Do Not Consume alerts.“By 2018, we expect to have addressed water quality in 19 of these towns, with the remaining to follow,” Dr Dharmabalan said.At Pioneer, resident Jenny Bellinger said rainwater tanks were being installed but that process had been too slow.“We asked for an alternative source of water that was lead-free,” Ms Bellinger said.“What we’ve been trying to do ... is to get TasWater to come back to our hall to talk to us because most of us didn’t want tanks, we wanted an alternative water supply.”TasWater said it was regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services across all its drinking water systems.It did thousands of water quality tests across the state each year.
Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence.The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves.The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'.But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'.This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage.The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website.Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain.It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this.'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.'It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings.Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend.And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost.The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft.It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises.They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke through the shutters before spending hours in the vault - emerging the next morning carrying the gems out the building in a wheelie bin.They then returned on Saturday night, apparently repeating the process throughout the night, leaving early on the morning of Easter Sunday.The burglary was discovered on Tuesday morning.Police have now said 72 out of the vaults 999 boxes were opened.
The Department of Health and Human Services buys more than 500,000 eggs a year, the prison service more than 70,000. Soon after winning government last year, Treasurer Peter Gutwein committed to overturn the “ridiculous” rule to buy non-cage eggs.“Under Labor, local businesses couldn’t get a look in,” a government spokesman said.“We said then it wasn’t good enough and that’s why shortly after coming to office we overturned Labor and the Greens’ ridiculous free-range egg regulations, which locked out Tasmanian businesses.”The Department of Health said Tasmanian Health Organisations north and south and Custodial Youth Justice have contracts for cage eggs with Pure Foods, which provides about 477,000 Tasmanian­-produced eggs a year.THO-North West had a contract for caged eggs with PFD Food Services, a Tasmanian company that sources its eggs from Queensland.“To ensure value for money and compliance with the buy local policy, the TPS purchases local eggs at the best price it can obtain, which is usually cage eggs,” a spokeswoman said.“The TPS requests that all eggs supplied are from Tasmanian sources, however, any eggs that we order for which there is an insufficient Tasmanian supply, are supplied from Victorian sources.”RSPCA Tasmania said the move was disappointing.“We understand the economic reality the government faces, however it sends a mixed message,” general manager Peter West said.The former government gave grants to Tasmanian producers to step up their cage-free production.Greens consumer affairs spokesman Nick McKim said the previous policy showed leadership by encouraging appropriate animal welfare standards.“By changing the policy, the Liberals have endorsed animal cruelty and a lowest common denominator approach to purchasing policy,” Mr McKim said.
Aaron Leeson-Woolley should have been wearing a tux and getting ready to watch his partner of five years walk down the aisle on Saturday.Instead, he wore yellow and sat in the middle of a Riverina park as he cried and hugged the hundreds of people who knew and loved his fiancee, Stephanie Scott.The body of the popular school teacher was recovered from bushland north of Griffith on Friday, five days after she was allegedly killed by cleaner Vincent Stanford.Ms Scott's parents, brothers and sisters joined the whole town of Leeton at a memorial picnic to honour their daughter and sister.Her father, Bob, told the crowd of hundreds gathered in Mountford Park that he wanted his daughter to be remembered for the great girl she was – and not the tragic way she was taken away."Stephanie was a bubbly, bright, witty, intelligent fun-loving girl who has obviously impacted on many people here today and our wishes for the future are that she will continue in your minds. I'm sure wherever she is now that she would wish that to be the case as you remember her as that great little girl she was."Moments after the moving tribute, Ms Scott's fiance rested his head against his bride-to-be's mother, Merrilyn Scott."He's doing it a bit tougher than most, as you can imagine," said Mr Scott.Ms Scott's father said the family had been moved by women in the small Riverina town who had hung their wedding dresses on their doors as a tribute to the bride-to-be. Within hours the tribute had spread around the country as brides from Brisbane to Melbourne joined in on the symbolic gesture."She was to be married today and some of the people in town have taken out their wedding dresses and hung them on their front doors, which is a great tribute to her."After the emotional speech, Ms Scott's fiance and her family walked into the middle of the Sunday park and let dozens of yellow balloons drift into the air as people clapped and cried.Police, firefighters and volunteers who have spent the past week searching for Ms Scott have also rallied around the family.The police officer who helped find Ms Scott's body knelt down before her fiance and offered his condolences in the park.Griffith police commander Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan appeared shaken by the killing that has rocked the small community.Only hours earlier, he had spoken of how police trail bike riders discovered Ms Scott's burnt remains in Cocoparra National Park, where her alleged killer regularly camped.On Saturday morning, Stephanie's sister Kim shared a wedding poem which described the deep bond Ms Scott and her fiance shared. She had intended to read it at the couples reception which, until the tragic events of this week, was due to take place that afternoon."We couldn't be happier, it's a dream come true," she wrote. "To watch your sister find happiness and to say I do."Kim Scott recalled how her little sister and Mr Leeson-Woolley met in their hometown of Canowindra growing up. "They shared car journeys," she wrote. "Along with Dad, Stuie and me."They make each other smile, they can fill a room with love.""Joking and laughing, they fit each other like a glove. I wish you all the happiness, for the many years to come."As the family shared memories of the bright and bubbly teacher and thought of the wedding that never was, her remains were being taken to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, where an autopsy will be carried out this week.
KITCHENER — Danielle Wellerdt and Mark Doherty first met in a boxing ring. So it was only fitting the boxing enthusiasts faced off in the same ring for their first fight as husband and wife."We wanted to start our marriage in this boxing ring," Danielle, 22, said. "And we don't dance."The couple remembered their first encounter fondly. It was three years ago and Mark was Danielle's first sparring partner in the ring.She knew right then he was a knockout."I elbowed him in the face in the first 33 seconds of the fight," she said.Mark, 27, laughed and added, "Yeah, it was fun, it was a good time."The newlyweds from Cambridge stripped out of their wedding attire early Saturday afternoon and donned gym gear, mouthguards and boxing gloves.These two weren't interested in a first dance at their wedding reception — they wanted a first fight, instead.Exercise equipment was pushed aside to make room for tables, food and decorations at SydFit Health Centre, the boxing gym where they first met.About 60 friends and family members swarmed the gym in fine suits and elegant dresses.Close friends said they weren't at all surprised when Danielle and Mark said they wanted to start their marriage with a sweaty, adrenaline-pumping boxing match instead of the traditional slow dance."She is a bit outrageous and it's always a bit of an adventure," said Colin Sarkany, a friend of Danielle's for over 10 years and a groomsman. "It's going to be a real fight."Felicia Johnston, one of her bridesmaids, piped in and said: "I know she will not hold back."Mark and Danielle love a good fight. For their first Valentine's Day date, the couple went to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga to watch a live professional boxing match.They are both boxing enthusiasts and Danielle is a trainer at Syd Vanderpool's gym.With fists in the air Mark "The Destroyer" and Danielle "The Grenade Launcher" smiled at each other from opposite ends of the boxing ring.Even though she couldn't stop giggling, Danielle packed a few good, hard punches at her new husband.Mark grinned from ear to ear just giddy with joy. Three rounds later Vanderpool declared Danielle the winner.The newlyweds hugged, out of breath, while their friends and family cheered them on. It was just how they wanted it to be.Vanderpool's words of advice: "You always have to remember to fight for your marriage."Now it was time for them to get out of sweaty clothes and off to their honeymoon in cottage country.
Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are parents of a baby boy, according to a report out Saturday.The couple's first son is named Silas Randall Timberlake, reps for the two told People in confirming the birth.Beyond the name, details are reportedly being kept private for now, in line with the couple's approach to confirming the pregnancy in the first place. While word that a baby was on the way bubbled up in November and seemed to be confirmed by former N'Sync bandmate Joey Fatone in December, the new parents didn't go public until the end of January."Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes!," Timberlake said on Instagram on his 34th birthday. "This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets."The couple marked Biel's birthday in March with a low-key dinner party with friends, after he wished her well via Instagram and called her "the sweetest, most GORGEOUS, goofiest, most BAD-ASS chick I know."Dad and son now share a middle name, Randall.Biel, 33, and the "Suit and Tie" singer got engaged in early 2012 and tied the knot later that year.Follow Christie D'Zurilla on Twitter @theCDZ and Google+.

It's a sport with a truly global reach as these images of children, amateurs and professional stars playing cricket show.The stunning shots make up the short-list for the Wisden–MCC Cricket Photograph of the Year 2014, which was won by Getty Images photographer Matthew Lewis.His image of Dwayne Bravo shows the player taking a breathtaking full-length catch for the West Indies to dismiss Australia’s James Faulkner during last year’s ICC World Twenty20 competition in Bangladesh.But portraits of ordinary players also make the list, from children on a Bangladesh rubbish tip to a club player attempting a catch in Kent.

Christopher Pyne counts calories. Obsessively. The federal Education Minister admits his use of the diet tracking application MyFitnessPal verges on an addiction.Since last February, Pyne has entered everything he eats, and any exercise he does, into the app. At the end of each day he checks whether he has stayed within 1250 calories – an ambitious target given dieticians recommend the average male consume around 2200 calories a day.Pyne dropped from 83 to 73 kilograms last year – an achievement he attributes to hourly morning walks, skipping snacks and avoiding breakfast (he opts for only black tea or coffee).He is among a large group of MPs who are growing ever-mindful of their food intake, and the exercise they do. As Deputy Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce remarked in a speech to Parliament last year: "From my observation, two things happen to you in this building: you gain weight and you lose touch."The challenges politicians face in staying healthy will be familiar to many Australians. Long, unpredictable working hours. Easy access to unhealthy food. Hours spent sitting down. It's a lifestyle that makes exercise virtually essential to keeping the bulge at bay.The Education Minister's regime is certainly a far cry from when he entered politics in 1993. Pyne was aged 25, and put on a 6.3 kilograms in his first year. There were no direct flights from his Adelaide electorate to Canberra so he had to fly via Melbourne. Cooked breakfasts would be served on both flights and he would eat on both."It's very easy in politics to put on weight; you're constantly being fed," he says. "There are very few functions where food isn't included – spring rolls, party pies, it's very calorific."At the start of each term of Parliament, an initiation session is held for newly-elected politicians. One of the key messages is: take care of your fitness."You are told that some MPs will put on 10kg in first term," says Labor MP Ed Husic, who entered Parliament in 2010.  "You have to be mindful of all your lifestyle choices because you see people literally growing in front of your eyes." Prime Minister Tony Abbott, of course, is a famous athlete – participating in 14-hour iron-man events, volunteer fire fighting and racing in the annual pollie pedal charity bike race. After winning government, he had a treadmill installed in his office so he could exercise during bad weather.Treasurer Joe Hockey, who had gastric bypass surgery in 2012, is regularly seen playing squash at the Parliament House gym in the early morning. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop jogs for 6 kilometres each morning on overseas trips.Bishop's predecessor, Bob Carr, generated guffaws around the country last year by writing of his passion for steel-cut oats, the "wonderful one-legged Romanian deadlift" and his desire to achieve "a concave abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques".John Howard was famous for his brisk early morning walks and John Hewson became known as Amphetamine Man for his long dawn runs while opposition leader.During the 1993 election, Hewson would schedule press conferences at the end, and sometimes the start, of his runs – a habit that infuriated the travelling press pack. One morning in Hobart the photographers hinted at their displeasure by showing up in their pyjamas and bathrobes.Paul Keating took to bouncing on a trampoline, an activity he believed would clean out the arteries and, one biographer claimed, even ward off cancer.But Ed Husic says there's no doubt today's politicians are paying increasing attention to diet and exercise."There's a growing belief that you can't perform at your best if you're not looking after yourself," says Husic, a passionate basketballer.Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has seen the benefits first hand. Like many men, Bowen says he was fit in his youth but let himself go in his 30s. When he turned 40 two years ago he decided to take action.He has since lost 17 kilograms by avoiding dessert, eating fewer carbohydrates and doing 45 minutes of weights and cardio each morning."I feel fitter and more energetic than I ever have," he says. "I used to get pretty tired and I just put that down to the job and the demands. Now I realise that I was going around with an extra load."One of Parliament's larger politicians, Liberal National Party member Ewan Jones, says being overweight can hold back a politician's career."People look at you and think you're lazy, that you can't do the job," says Jones, who hovers between 120 and 150 kilograms. "You only get one chance to make a first impression."Jones has recently tried the intermittent (5:2) fasting diet in which you eat normally for five days a week and fast on the other two – a current favourite among many politicians. He admits it has been a struggle: "It's very hard when someone walks past you with a rice-paper roll," he says.A commitment to fitness carries risks as well as rewards, as some politicians have discovered. In 1990, speaker Leo McLeay broke his arm and suffered facial injuries when a bike he had rented from Parliament House collapsed underneath him. He later won $65,000 in compensation. Today's elected representatives keen to cruise around Capital Hill must now provide their own set of wheels.
The US Capitol Building has been placed on lockdownOne federal official told NBC News that there were "no indications at this point of terrorism".Police were also investigating a suspicious package close to the complex, which was later reported to be the suspected shooter's suitcase.There are no indications at this point of terrorismAccording to several Twitter users, the person who was shot was a protester.Some described the individual as holding a placard which read: "Tax the 1 per cent."The building was placed on lockdown on Saturday as a precautionary measure, with no one being allowed to enter or exit the area.Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement: "The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit."She added shortly afterwards: "Confirmed: self-inflicted gunshot by neutralized subject."Few lawmakers are currently in the area as Congress is out of session this week.
Hollywood icon Raquel Welch has spoken of how she launched a furious attack on her father as a child after snapping over his cruel behaviour.The actress said she was “terrified” of Armando, who once held her head under a faucet and made her cut her hair off.She finally flipped at 16 when she saw him throw milk over mum Josephine after complaining about her cooking – screaming out and flying at him with a poker.Raquel said: “I think my mum rather liked it but he was shocked.“He didn’t treat my mother very nicely. I picked up the poker at the fireplace and came at him and said, ‘Don’t you ever do that to mother again or I’ll…’“He was stunned. I had never thought about confronting my father like that, it was just an instinct.“I thought it was cruel, demeaning and totally uncalled for. She was phenomenal, she was a wonderful woman.“I didn’t like the way that you could be with a man and he could treat you so badly and he’s your husband.”Innocent: Raquel was "just a kid in pigtails"The 74-year-old, who sent pulses racing in her fur-kini in 1966’s One Million Years BC, was also berated by her dad for paying attention to her looks.She revealed that when she started junior high school at 13 she got her braids cut into a shorter style “with curls and all pretty and girly”. But Armando, an aeronautical engineer from Bolivia, was livid.Speaking on Piers Morgan’s ITV show Life Stories, Raquel said: “My father was a tough customer. He was very strict, I was terrified of him and there were times I disliked him.“When I came home with that haircut, he ran my head under the faucet. He didn’t like it. He said ‘Cut it, you’re not having curls like that!’ So I had very short hair."He didn’t want me to be too girly, I think he didn’t want me to get involved with boys too early. I just hated that he was clipping my wings.“But at the same time I had enormous respect for him and I did want to please him.”Glamorous: The actress became an iconRaquel was born Jo Raquel Tejada in Chicago in 1940 and dad Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo hailed from La Paz while mum Josephine Sarah was from the US.The star married childhood sweetheart James Welch at 18 after becoming pregnant and they had children Damon, now 55, and Latanne, 53, before splitting after four years.She married producer Patrick Curtis in 1966 and divorced him in 1972, then in 1980 began a 10-year marriage with producer and director André Weinfeld.She wed fourth husband Richard Palmer in 1999 but they separated in 2008 – and she has said she does not intend to marry again.Speaking about life in Beverly Hills at 74, Raquel said: “Being seen as a sex symbol and getting older, you know, it does make you very self-conscious.“Fortunately, because of my dancing background I was very disciplined about physical fitness. I also bumped into yoga when I was 40. What people don’t realise is it’s not just a crazy exercise where you get into odd poses, it’s very scientifically designed.”
WHETHER you want to kick-back in the music room or sit out on a balcony in this south-facing home, this property has it all - especially for beach lovers. Weekend's CHRIS CAMPBELL takes a look.MOMENTS away from Bracelet Bay is this four bedroom property offering a perfect family spot with outstanding sea views.In fine weather, the owners enjoy a dip in the sea before returning back to their home in Cleveland Avenue, Limeslade - what they call their Californian beach house - for a barbecue.They have many a peaceful evening, with the blinds of the impressive conservatory open, letting the moonlight in as they drift off to sleep.This conservatory and the spacious open plan lounge/dining room have wonderful views out to sea.Two en suite shower rooms and a bathroom mean that when their sons or guests come to stay there is plenty of space for privacy.The owner, who has lived at the house with his wife for almost five years and did not wish to be named, says the south-facing layout of the house meant it is perfect for enjoying sunshine throughout the day."It's very easy to live here," he says. "We have lived by the sea most of our lives but this is different. We describe it as our equivalent to a Californian beach house."Our sons come home with their partners and they have their own rooms and space."The couple re-laid two patios, to the front and back of the property, and a picket fence runs around the house. This includes six gateways. It means children can play in certain areas and it was helpful when letting their late Labrador outside.Through the hallway, the kitchen also has sea views, with a window to the front.The lounge has an attractive beamed ceiling and there is a wall-mounted, flame effect gas fire, with a remote control. A purple painted wall - the couple have had the inside and outside of the house repainted - complements the wooden beams and adds a splash of colour to an otherwise neutral coloured home.See these four housing schemes which could change the face of SwanseaA wooden staircase can also be found in this room as well as a painting of the coast on the wall, plus family photographs. The space is well-used and shouts comfort.There are two good-size balconies offering those great views and where morning coffee and newspapers or evening drinks can be enjoyed. The view is a lovely mix of nature, nearby houses and, of course, the sea.A four suite bathroom can be found on this floor, with a walk-in shower and under floor heating. The bathroom also has a built-in sound system.Two bedrooms with beamed ceilings and built-in wardrobes can be found on the first floor, plus one of the en suite shower rooms.Those wanting to play or listen to a little music and enjoy a few drinks, can head to the basement, where there is a music room - with guitar - and bar. This is actually the same level as the garden and has doors out onto it. Bedrooms three and four, again with built-in wardrobes, can be found here. There is an en suite too, with wooden flooring and a step-in shower.An attractive, newly resurfaced lane leading to the property at the front creates driveway parking for several cars. There is also a garden here.To the back, an attractive patio leads onto the south-facing lawned garden area. A raised decked area is to the side.Cleveland Avenue is close to Mumbles and the beach-side promenade, boutique shops, wine bars and traditional pubs it offers.The owner adds: "This house is made up of different layers. It's got everything, whether you're enjoying a barbecue after the beach or want to relax in the music room on the lower floor."The property: Four-bedroom detached house, which makes the most of its stunning viewsWho lives here: Older couple. Their children come back to visit.The look: Modern and open with beach house feel but with beamed ceilings.Lessons learnt: Find a south-facing home to make the most of the sunshine throughout the day.
It was the match of the day as Bobby Moore's granddaughter kicked off married life - full of joyful highlights but missing a couple of key players.The granddaughter of the England ­football hero married her childhood sweetheart at Chelsea register office in front of 12 loved ones.Poppy Moore and Sam Myers, both 23, then held the second leg at a London’s Mayfair Hotel with 50 guests.Poppy carried a picture of her late dad Dean in her wedding bouquet. He died of natural causes in July 2011, aged 43.She was just 18 months old when in February 1993 granddad Bobby, who captained England’s 1966 World Cup winning side, died of bowel cancer, aged 51.Tragic: Bobby Moore with granddaughter Poppy the day after he revealed he had cancerHer mum Sara said: “Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all.“It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.”Poppy marked the 20th anniversary of the legend's death in 2013 with his two other grandchildren, Freddie and Ava. They placed the ball on the spot for a West Ham home game - the club he skippered for ten years.Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer.Moore, who would have been 74 today, won 108 England caps, including 90 as captain and was ­described by Brazil legend Pele as “the greatest defender I ever played against”.

DUNBLANE (UNITED KINGDOM) - Tennis ace Andy Murray married his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane's 12th century cathedral on Saturday, bringing his Scottish hometown to a standstill.The newlyweds came under a shower of confetti as they left the church at 5.40 pm (1640GMT), just over an hour after they arrived.Sears wore a white dress with a plunging neckline, lace sleeves and a long train carried by four bridesmaids while the groom wore a green and blue tartan kilt.A bagpiper earlier welcomed the 2013 Wimbledon champion into the church while Sears arrived in a car a few minutes later, to a peel of applause from the gathered crowds.Ahead of the service, Murray posted a series of "emojis" to his 2.98 million Twitter followers, revealing his plans for the day. They ended with cocktails, kisses and several Zzzz sleep symbols.Despite earlier hailstorms, the sun shone on family and friends as they arrived for the intimate service in Dunblane Cathedral, which was decorated with huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized blossom trees.With an eye on the skies, Murray's mother Judy tweeted: "Hailstones. Marvellous" and then later "Snowing. #whitewedding".Murray revealed that his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier were to share best man duties.Several fans camped overnight to catch a glimpse of the couple and the streets were festooned with bunting in scenes usually reserved for a royal wedding.Reverend Colin Renwick, who married the couple, received huge cheers as he arrived at the cathedral.The 27-year-old Sears has already become accustomed to the limelight, often finding herself in the cameraman's sights while watching Murray courtside at events all around the world.She too grew up in a tennis-loving home with father Nigel Sears formerly the LTA's head of women's tennis.Shedding her demure image, Sears hit the front pages during this year's Australian Open when she was filmed muttering expletives in the direction of the box of Czech opponent Tomas Berdych.She turned up at the next match wearing a "parental advisory explicit content" jersey.Sears was once described by Judy Murray as "the best thing to happen to Andy".But he reportedly upset her when in January this year he sent a 'joke' message to a fan saying: "We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day," only to have to issue a retraction in a follow-up tweet.The world number three player is hosting the reception at his own 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, which he bought two years ago for pound sterling1.9 million ($2.8 million, 2.6 million euros).Pubs in the town got into the spirit, offering champagne and strawberries to mark the occasion.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered her support, saying: "Andy is a local hero there but he is also a Scottish sporting superstar, and the whole nation will be delighted for him and his new wife."The grand slam champion predicted few nerves come game time."We've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well," he said."So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change."Murray and Dunblane share a painful past after the town was hit by tragedy in March 1996 when Thomas Hamilton shot 16 pupils and a teacher dead at the Scot's primary school.The tennis player, who had to hide in the school during the massacre, broke down in tears when discussing it during a television interview.
South Carolina grandmother Joyce Kuhl has launched a new class lawsuit against the SeaWorld center in Orlando, Florida - in which she accuses the marine park of trying to mask "the ugly truth about the unhealthy and despairing lives of these whales". In the lawsuit, she claims the orcas in the Orlanda park are kept in 8ft deep holding pools - supposedly leaving them with horrific sunburn. She then alleges that the resulting burns are so bad, staff are forced to PAINT over the wounds with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries. The lawsuit also claims that chlorine solution "many times stronger than household bleach" is being used in tanks where the whales are confined after being caught or bred. "These orcas suffer in tiny, unnatural chemical tubs," the court document states.The creatures are also forced to go days without food while being trained, the lawsuit alleges. And it also claims that the whales are "subject to drugging" to help calm them when they react against conditions in their confinement. "Perhaps most telling, captive orcas are also subject to drugging by SeaWorld personnel with antipsychotic and psychoactive drugs, including benzodiazepines such as Diazepam (generic Valium), which are given to calm the captive orcas which react against their conditions of confinement," the lawsuit states. Ms Kuhl pointed out in the document that in the wild, orcas live between 30 and 50 years - whereas she said most orcas in SeaWorld die in their teens or 20s.She is now seeking to have her $97 ticket money from her December 2013 trip reimbursed - as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, the Orlando Sentinel reports. SeaWorld Florida is visited by over 5 million people a year, according to the lawsuit. At around $100 a ticket, this means the park could potentially be sued for at least $2billion. On Friday, SeaWorld said it "is committed in every respect to the health and well-being of the animals in our care" and said the lawsuit "appears to be an attempt by animal right extremists to use the courts to advance an anti-zoo agenda". They continued: "The suit is baseless, filled with inaccuracies, and SeaWorld intends to defend itself against these inaccurate claims." The Guardian was told by a source that Ms Kuhl is not an animal rights activist, but "an ordinary animal lover" who found out information after visiting the aquatic park that was "inconsistent" with the company's marketing. This is the second time that SeaWorld has been sued in less than three weeks, after a class action lawsuit was filed in California last month. The California lawsuit targets all three SeaWorld locations - San Diego in California, San Antonio in Texas and Orlando in Florida.
British comedian Russell Brand has tweeted his support for saving Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from an Indonesian firing squad.Saturday's tweet from Brand (@rustyrockets) reads: "These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP! info.mercycampaign.org/watch/."The tweet includes a link to the website of the campaign for mercy for the convicted drug traffickers, where video interviews of the pair can be viewed and a petition signed.Brand is well known for his outspoken views on politics and human rights and in February blasted Australia's policy of using offshore migrant detention centres.Chan and Sukumaran's fight to avoid execution last week moved to Indonesia's constitutional court after they lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court.The pair's lawyers on Thursday sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency.Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the latest challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it.Jakarta is now just waiting on the legal efforts of a few other death row prisoners before setting an execution date.The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island, where Indonesia plans to execute them by firing squad.
WASHINGTON - A person shot him or herself dead near the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, sparking a security lockdown at the complex, U.S. Capitol police said.Police were also investigating a suspicious package on the lower west terrace of the Capitol building in Washington, and several nearby streets were closed. Several media reports said it was luggage left by the person.Police said the lockdown was a precautionary measure."There are no indications at this point of terrorism," a U.S. official told NBC News."The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit," Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement.She did not say if the person was a man or a woman.The incident occurred on a Saturday and Congress is out of session this week, so few lawmakers were in town. But the city was crowded with tourists visiting for the popular annual Cherry Blossom festival.
Washington: At 115, Jeralean Talley is now the world's oldest person. The American leads the elite club of "supercentenarians" – people more than 111 years old.It's not as small a club as you may think. More than 50 people, carefully tallied by US researchers, have passed the milestone.After Monday's death of fellow American Gertrude Weaver, who would have turned 117 on July 4, Talley is the oldest person recorded by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG),An African American, she was born in the southern US state of Georgia at the tail end of the 19th century on May 23, 1899. These days she lives near Detroit.Talley is part of even more restricted club of three people recorded as having seen three centuries: the final years of the 19th, the full sweep of the 20th and the start of the 21st.In this she joins Susannah Mushatt Jones, also an African American, born July 6, 1899 and Italy's Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, born November 29, 1899."There is always a small chance that there's somebody out that has not applied. To show up at 116 is not very likely but it's still possible," said Robert Young, a GRG researcher and an expert for Guinness World Records.The GRG, which bases its tally on the work of researchers, demographers, biologists and amateur enthusiasts, has for now counted 52 people – 50 women and two men – who have surpassed 111 years and can prove it with a birth certificate and marriage certificates for surname changes.Peru's Filomena Taipe, who local authorities said died on Monday at the age of 117, did not have original proof of birth, said Young.The Peruvian government said she was born on December 20, 1897, the date on her national identity card."Ninety-nine per cent of people that claim to be over 115 turn out to be false," the researcher said.He estimated at more than 1000 the number of people who may be 110, and at around 300 those who have been certified as having that many years under their belt.Talley took the title held for five days by Weaver following the death of Japan's Misao Okawa. She died on April 1, less than a month after turning 117.Talley told the Detroit Free Press that the secret to her longevity comes "from above"."That's the best advice I can give you. It's not in my hands or your hands," she said, pointing toward the heavens.Time magazine, who contacted her family, including her only daughter, 77-year-old Thelma Holloway, said the new doyenne eats lots of pork, is a true night owl and kept up her bowling hobby until the age of 104.On her birthdays, she likes to go fishing.Slightly younger, Susannah Mushatt Jones, born in Alabama, has no children but for many years she looked after those of rich families.She studied "negro music in France" and likes fine lingerie and barbecues, according to US media reports.These supercentenarians, Young said, are people who "have taken care of themselves, they stay independent, they are mentally strong."They have social networks such as church and family," he added.They stayed active for a long time, sleep well and eat in moderation, he added."It's like winning the genetic lottery, but it's not enough. You also have to live your life the right way," Young said."You have to keep your vices in check."Sarah Knauss, an american who died at the age of 119, hated vegetables and Jeanne Calment of France, who died at the age of 122, smoked two or three cigarettes a day, he added.The number of supercentenarians could well grow because life expectancy is growing and the world population is also increasing. Documentation is also easier to come by, although Africa, China and India lag behind in this.He said that the number of people reaching 115 is going to increase slowly.The record for the person to have lived the longest – and with papers to prove it – is still held by Calment of France. She passed away in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days.
President Barack Obama declared his refusal to refight the Cold War battles of the past while Cuban President Raul Castro rallied to his defence, absolving Obama of fault for the U. blockade in a stunning reversal of more than 50 years of animosity between the two countries.Castro, in an hour-long speech to the Summit of the Americas in Panama City, ran through an exhaustive history of perceived Cuban grievances against the US dating back more than a century - a vivid display of how raw passions remain over American attempts to undermine Cuba's government.Then, in an abrupt about face, he apologised for letting his emotions get the best of him. He said many US presidents were at fault for that troubled history - but that Obama isn't one of them."I have told President Obama that I get very emotional talking about the revolution," Castro said through a translator, noting that Obama wasn't even born when the US began sanctioning the island nation."I apologise to him because President Obama had no responsibility for this."In a remarkable vote of confidence from a Cuban leader, Castro added: "In my opinion, President Obama is an honest man."Castro and Obama were expected to meet later tonight on the sidelines of the summit - the first substantial meeting between a US and Cuban president in more than five decades. The flurry of diplomacy was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their previously announced plan to restore normal relations between the US and Cuba.Speaking just before Castro, Obama acknowledged that deep differences between their countries would persist. Yet he said he was uninterested in getting bogged down in ideology, instead casting the thaw in relations as an opening to create "more opportunities and resources for the Cuban people"."The United States will not be imprisoned by the past," President Barack Obama said. "We're looking to the future."Raising the stakes even higher for the two leaders was mounting speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit taking place in Panama to announce his decision to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, a gesture that for Cuba holds both practical and symbolic value.The US long ago stopped accusing Cuba of conducting terrorism, and Obama has signalled that he's ready to take Cuba off the list. On Thursday, he suggested an announcement was imminent when he revealed that the State Department had completed its lengthy review of the designation.Obama arrived at the summit for a day of marathon meetings with leaders from across the Western Hemisphere, gathered around a massive oval table with two birds of peace in the middle.A successful relaunch of US-Cuba relations would form a cornerstone of Obama's foreign policy legacy. But it is an endeavour he cannott undertake alone: Only Congress can fully lift the onerous US sanctions regime on Cuba, and there are deep pockets of opposition in the US to taking that step.
President John Mahama and his government must investigate the tirade of deputy trade and industry minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed and reprimand him, Editor-in-chief of the New Crusading Guide newspaper Kweku Baako has said.Mr Baako told Joy FM’s news analysis programme newsfile Saturday that Mr Muhammed’s “utterances are weighty enough to warrant some level of investigations.”In his view, the Nanton MP “must be held accountable and [asked to] provide answers”.According to him, “He is already a problem. The presidency may have to take a look at him.”“The allegations that he made ought to be investigated. Personally he has damaged himself in many ways. A deputy minister of state does not take to radio to say those things…” Mr Baako told host Samson Lardy Anyenini.“I will expect that a certain public reprimand or show of some public sanction ought to be meted out.”Mr Muhammed, in an interview on Tamale-based Diamond FM, recently accused a fellow legislator in the same governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) of scheming to court disaffection for him in his own constituency and eventually get him out.“It is pathetic, absolutely pathetic: it’s unethical, it’s so funny, it’s so stupid, it’s so silly, it’s nasty, it’s un-Islamic for people in the same party to be sitting down and their intention is about how they can get someone out of Parliament,” he burst out.He warned the chiefs, Mallams and party elders in the constituency against restraining him if he began speaking out to expose his detractors, since in his opinion, those leaders are not speaking against his detractors because they have been bought with “filthy, ill-gotten money”.Apart from his radio outburst, Mr Muhammed alleged on his Facebook page recently that a fellow MP, who is also a Minister hired a girl and equipped her with a tablet so she could get nude pictures of a fellow Cabinet Minister.He was summoned by the presidency over the allegations.

At last, redemption for our brown and pleasant land. "When I look at the map and see what an ugly country Australia is," Oscar Wilde wrote a hundred and a bitty years ago, "I feel that I want to go there and see if it cannot be changed into a more beautiful form." This week though, American astronaut Scott Kelly gazed down and saw something better than a mere map, he saw the continent in its entirety. He was moved enough to tweet: "#Australia. You are very beautiful. Thanks for being there to brighten our day." Beam us up, Scotty! A pleasure. Fly well.One of our heroesAs we speak, TFF is writing a book on the battle of Fromelles and Pozieres where, in a period of around six weeks Australia suffered a staggering 28,000 casualties – with more men killed in just 14 hours at Fromelles than in the Boer War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Iraq and Afghanistan put together. One of the casualties was Victorian woodcutter Albert Jacka, who had already distinguished himself by being Australia's first recipient of a Victoria Cross for his courage under fire at Gallipoli. At Pozieres on August 7, he doubled the dose, and many considered him unlucky not to win a second Victoria Cross, though personally, Jacka was just glad to have narrowly survived, having been wounded seven times in the action. He went on to be mayor of St Kilda, and when he died in 1932, his coffin was borne by eight fellow winners of the VC. .I applaud Bill Shorten, urging the government to tighten the rules which allow conscientious objectors to omit having their children vaccinated, if they fill out a form stating they have a "personal, philosophical, religious or medical belief involving a conviction that vaccination should not take place..." I don't get him allowing an enduring exception for those with strong religious beliefs against it. This is not philosophically coherent. We, as a society, have rightly decided we have a duty of care to all our children to ensure they are vaccinated. How is that duty abrogated because the parents of a child decide their particular Magic Sky Daddy is against it? Too bad. The duty of care to the child clearly outweighs the parents' adherence to superstitions. And while you may disagree because of your own superstitions, the State, surely, must be free of them, and so insist.Up at the Cross's Bourbon & Beefsteak, there's this barman, see, who is so sure that he is the strongest man around that, with the blessing of his boss – who figures it's good for business – he offers a standing $100 bet ... What he does, follow, is use the power in his massive forearms and hands to squeeze a lemon until all the juice runs into a glass, and then hands the lemon to the patron. Anyone who can squeeze two more drops of juice out of it wins the money. They come, they go, over the years. Weightlifters, dockworkers, footballers, wrestlers, gym junkies from that all-night gym down on Crown Street, but nobody ever manages to do it!One day, though, this scrawny little bloke comes into the bar, wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a polyester suit. He sits down, orders a glass of draft beer and spots the sign on the wall about the lemon challenge. "I was just reading your sign," he says in a small voice, "and I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter dies down, the bartender says, "OK". Grabbing the lemon, he squeezes it until the pips squeak, and hands the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little fellow. Without any further ado, the customer clenches his little fist around the lemon ... and six drops fall into the glass. As the crowd cheers, the stunned bartender pays the bloke his money, and asks the obvious: "Do you mind if I ask what do you do for a living? Are you a dockworker, a weight-lifter, or what?"The little fellow quietly replies: "I work for the tax department."They said it"As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well.

If there's one thing the government, opposition and business are agreed on it is the importance of Asia and the Pacific in Australia's future development.Central to our engagement is knowledge of the region's cultures and languages, so you would think that the key school at the Australian National University teaching and researching these subjects would be booming.But not so.  A budget review has found that the school of Culture, History and Language - the major Asian languages teaching school at the university - is running at a loss.According to the director of the school, Professor Ken George, a budget review in the first half of 2014 revealed that "operational costs attached to CHL's current structure, activities, and strategic vision had exceeded actual and anticipated revenues".Those conditions persist, he says, in a recent statement telling all staff and students that an academic review of the school would help renew its intellectual mission, redraw its institutional design and set plans to ensure its sustainability as a globally visible, world-leading centre for research and teaching.As part of this review all staff have been ordered to assess their own performance and academics, including professors, are being called in individually and asked to consider early retirement, continuity, redeployment, or redundancy.Insiders say morale has plummeted with senior staff getting the impression they are no longer wanted.The process is also reviving memories of the ANU School of Music debacle when the university cut 23 academic and nine administrative staff in 2012.ACT branch of the National Tertiary Education Union president Jack Bowers says the ANU has used the term review in the past as a code word for what the union considers to be the wholesale decimation of schools. Internal accounting had frequently been used as a justification for reviews and that seemed to be the case now.Others suggest the shake-up and the morale-destroying one-on-one staff interviews are influenced by financial considerations.The university has a central voluntary early retirement fund and if senior staff leave early their accumulated entitlements can be paid out of this fund.This would save the school itself from having to make redundancy payments in the event of a downsizing. In the case of redundancy the school would be required to pay three weeks' salary for each year of service with a minimum payment of five weeks' pay and maximum of 68 weeks.Professor Veronica Taylor, the Dean of the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, in which the school resides, says as part of identifying options to strengthen the school, academic staff are "being invited to think about their own professional pathways, and - for senior staff - whether now is a good time to consider early retirement or pre-retirement planning"."The review is in its early stages and no staff or part of the school have been identified for redundancies," she says.But many of the staff who have been asked to consider continuity, voluntary early retirement, redeployment, or redundancy see it differently.One of the dangers is that the most valued staff – those most likely to be wanted by other institutions – will be the first to leave.The one-on-one interviews with the discussions of redundancy options are being held before an external review panel begins an examination later this year to determine the precise role, excellence, innovativeness and sustainability of the school.Given the way the process is being handled, some staff, in key positions that the university would want to maintain, may well have decided to leave before the panel brings down its recommendations.The school may well find it's not easy to get replacements and its reputation will suffer accordingly.There is also the question of who will carry on teaching and supervising PhD candidates if senior academics leave.The ANU is proud of its high standing in world university rankings, usually either ranking as the highest or second highest Australian university.This is in large part due to its international outlook and its performance in Arts and Humanities.The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, for example, gives the university an overall score of 66.5 but in the five categories of teaching, international outlook, industry outcome, research and citations the highest score it gets is the 91.3 in international outlook.Slashing a school which must be making a major contribution to this score hardly seems sensible.The school also boasts four members holding prestigious Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowships – the highest number of such fellowships in any school at the university.Eight years have gone by since the College of Asia and the Pacific's conceptual launch in 2006 and six since its 2008 strategic review.The school of Culture, History and Language within CAP was formally constituted in 2010, making its review seem premature.Professor Taylor acknowledges that the typical review cycle in the university is six to seven years.She says other academic units within her College and across the ANU are scheduled for reviews on this cycle.In 2012, then opposition leader Tony Abbott drew attention to the fact that Australia was supposed to be adapting to the Asian century but Australians' study of foreign languages, especially Asian languages, was in precipitous decline.From every perspective - trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea, understanding of threats and conflict in the region, business, tourism, culture, environmental destruction – knowledge of the languages of the region and high level university research is essential.If the school is indeed running at a loss then perhaps the solution is to find ways to boost revenue rather than cut staff.Better marketing of what the school has to offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students would be a start.Scaring those with the foremost knowledge of the Asia Pacific region into leaving the ANU is not the way of the future.
Hundreds of mourners have gathered for the funeral of Walter Scott, an unarmed black suspect who was shot dead by a white officer in South Carolina as he fled following a routine traffic stop.Mr Scott's death, which a bystander caught on video, reignited debates about excessive police force and race relations in the United States.His body arrived on Saturday at Word Ministries Christian Centre where family, friends, politicians and law enforcement gathered to bury the 50-year-old father of four.Mr Scott's casket was draped in an American flag and a Dallas Cowboys sign in honour of his favourite football team.An estimated 200 to 300 people gathered outside the church as the family entered, and a funeral program showed photos of the family along with the words "We Will Miss You".South Carolina senator Tim Scott posted on Twitter ahead of the funeral: "Attending Walter Scott's homegoing service. Thankful to have been able to pray and talk with his family this week."Reverend James Johnson, president of the local chapter of civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network, said he hoped Mr Scott's death would lead to something good."This is a sad day," Reverend Johnson said ahead of the service."God has got a reason for what has happened. Hopefully this will heal the world."The officer who killed Mr Scott, 33-year-old Michael Slager, was charged with murder and fired from the force. He faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.The bystander video shows Mr Scott running from Slager, who pulls his gun and fires eight shots, five of which hit Mr Scott.An earlier dash cam video shows Mr Scott's car being pulled over by Slager, who asks for Mr Scott's registration before Mr Scott runs away after Slager returns to his own vehicle.Mr Scott's father said his son may have been running because he owed child support and did not want to return to jail.South Carolina police said they were suspicious of the shooting from the beginning because of "inconsistencies" in Slager's initial reporting of events and multiple gunshot wounds in Mr Scott's back.Slager had said he felt threatened during his encounter with Mr Scott.North Charleston mayor Keith Summey said the city's police would be required to wear body cameras in the future to record interactions with the public.US congressman James Clyburn, who was among the 500 people at the funeral, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered."Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea," Mr Clyburn said.Mr Scott had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support and was forced out of the US Coast Guard in 1986 after more than two years' service because of a drug offence.He was nonetheless discharged under honourable conditions because he had a good record of service, the Coast Guard said.Demonstrators gathered for peaceful protests in North Charleston after the killing, with some demanding the city council create a citizens review board to look into police conduct.Mr Scott's family called for greater accountability among police and hoped Mr Scott's death would spark reform within the force.His shooting came in the wake of a series of similar incidents that have provoked outrage and protests across the United States, most notoriously the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri last August.There are no comprehensive national statistics on how many people die at US police hands each year.Human Rights Watch estimates that out of a reported more than 2,700 police-involved deaths deemed "justifiable" by authorities between 2005-2011, just 41 officers were charged.The US Justice Department has launched investigations into a number of police departments, including Ferguson's, after shootings.
PHILADELPHIA - The Senators wrote their own version of Philadelphia Freedom Saturday afternoon ... a ticket to the playoffs.The most historic comeback in NHL history is complete.Fourteen points out of a playoff spot on Feb. 10, the Senators went a remarkable 23-4-4 in their last 31 games by closing out the season with an incredible 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at the Wells Fargo Center.Not since the 1993-94 New York Islanders came from 12 points back has a team closed a larger gap to make the post-season.Like they have on so many nights throughout this incredible run, the Senators turned to Andrew (The Hamburglar) Hammond, who was brilliant with 34 stops while Mark Stone scored twice and Jean-Gabriel Pageau chipped in to beat Philadelphia goalie Steve Mason on the 22 shots he faced.The Senators will have to watch Hockey Night in Canada to find out who they face in the first round. The New York Rangers have been ruled out but depending on the outcome of Saturday night's games it could either be the Montreal Canadiens or the Tampa Bay Lightning.It wasn't the Senators best effort but Stone put it away in the third with his 26th of the season on a breakaway. Hammond moved his record to 20-1-2. Wow.Ahead 2-1 after 40 minutes, the Senators were fortunate to be in that position.They were outshot 30-13 through two periods by the Flyers and were being completely outplayed. Hammond had to come up huge, otherwise, there's not a hope the Senators are in the lead.For a long time, the Senators looked like they needed a walk-up call at a time they were having their afternoon naps. That came midway through the second period when coach Dave Cameron read them the riot act because he didn't like what was happening on the ice one bit.The Senators were outshot 16-8 but Pageau's 10th of the season at 16:18 gave the club the lead. Defenceman Marc Methot did a great job taking the puck coast-to-coast and then Pageau, who had plenty of chances, went to the net and beat Mason on the glove side putting it home at 16:18.Sitting back trying to protect the lead, the Senators got burned only 1:23 into the second when Read tied it up. He was left alone in front of the net and all he had to do was take a pass from Brayden Schenn to beat Hammond on glove side to tie it up and make everybody in Ottawa nervous.The Senators weren't sure what to make of their start.They were outshot 14-5 by the Flyers but led where it counted the most with a 1-0 advantage on the scoreboard. Hammond wasn't tested a whole lot but did make a good stop on Brayden Schenn down low on a power play. The Senators did go stretch of almost 13 minutes without a shot on Mason.While they had a few good opportunities, it was a gift-goal that opened the scoring on the power play for Ottawa. Mason misplayed the puck in his own end by giving it to Clarke MacArthur in the circle, he threw it to Stone in the slot and all he had to do was put it into an open net at 6:06.The Senators are expected to open the playoffs in Tampa or Montreal Thursday.
Listening to a diner asking about the provenance of the chicken she was about to order, whether the juices served at the cafe were organic and if their vinegar was in fact gluten free, I was left wondering where I'd observed this devotion to purity before.The idea of sanctity has a hard time gaining traction in an increasingly secular Australia, and invoking "purity" when it comes to sex and our bodies is likely to see you roasted by feminists and flirty footballers alike.Despite this, there are many conservatives in this country, and billions more worldwide, who view promiscuity, virginity, abortion, contraception – and the "purity" these practices ensure or defile – as moral issues with distinctly right and wrong answers governed by universal law.In turn, you don't have to go far to find a Greens voter or small-l liberal who considers meat eating, factory farming, genetically modified foods, pesticides and the environmental degradation caused by all of the above as equally pressing moral concerns, governed by that same universal law.Listening to the likes of Pete Evans preach about paleo, Sarah Wilson sermonise about sugar, or any number of TV chefs pontificate about macrobiotics, ancient grains, the terroir of heirloom tomatoes and the need to use the "freshest" foods available, you'd have to admit there's more than a pinch of piety going around when it comes to food.Get a certain type of hipster started about water quality, coffee beans and cold-pressed juice and you might as well pull up an ironic deconstruction of a stool and take a seat for the duration of the ensuing monologue.What's interesting, however, is the inability of both ends of the political spectrum to take seriously the other's views on purity, while being deadly serious about the obvious nature of their own conceptions.The further you travel along both these  paths of belief, the more likely you'll also encounter "magic" and pseudo-scientific claims backed by little evidence but plenty of faith. Last week's epic takedown of the American 'Food Babe' blogger by an actual scientist is an amusing case in point.While it's difficult to argue with the data on the benefits of cutting down on red meat, sugar and cholesterol, many of the more fashionable assertions made by foodie evangelists seem to occupy the same gormless, glowing gap in the firmament where Our Lord Allah Jehovah Yahweh the Sky Wizard lives.Many liberals would passionately argue that notions of religious and bodily purity – and its close relative sanctity – have no place in discussions of morality, yet they are happy to moralise about the sacredness of the environment, animal welfare and "natural" food production.The truth, as any psychologist will tell you, is our ideas about purity – whether they concern sex, food, or spirituality – derive from ancient (and in many cases accurate) beliefs our bodies can be desecrated by both immoral acts and contaminants.As the influential social psychologist Jonathan Haidt puts it: "Purity is not just about suppressing female sexuality, it's about any kind of ideology that tells you you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body."Religious conceptions of purity in food are well known to Jews and Muslims, and vegetarianism stretches from Buddhists and Jains all the way to Seventh Day Adventist Christians. However, the disgust felt by a vegan yoga mum about a veal parmigiana is no less real than that felt by a Salvo or Hillsonger contemplating certain "unnatural" sexual acts.Both believe your body is a temple, they just disagree on the rites conducted therein.
PDP’s Ishaku in early lead in 10 councils of TarabaThe Peoples Democratic (PDP) was in early lead in the governorship and State Assembly elections in ten of the sixteen local government councils of Taraba state on Saturday.The PDP which fielded Darius Dickson Ishaku was leading in Wukari, Donga, Karimlamido, Kurmi, Bali, Takum, Ussa, Zing, Yorro and Jalingo -the state capital.Bali local government area had voted for the President Elect Gen. Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential election. but the people however voted for the PDP in Saturday’s guber polls.Ailing Governor Danbaba Suntai left the Government House in Jalingo early morning to his village Suntai to vote for his PDP candidate (Ishaku).A heavy crowd swarmed him, some shielding tears of love and joy. They queued behind him to vote for PDP.Suntai voted in his Maman 012 polling unit of Suntai Ward.The governor did his accreditation and voting in his official car.The PDP was also leading in the House of Assembly elections.The PDP candidates in Wukari I and II constituencies were already declared winners as at press time.Mean while the elections in Kashimbilla and Malushe areas of Takum were postponed for Sunday.
It's back: Simon Cowell and Britain's Got TalentPoor old Simon Cowell. Still banging on about “changing lives” after The Voice proved that what the nation really wants is a show that does nothing of the sort.Ironically, not finding stars amid a pathetic parade of preposterous no-hopers remains Britain’s Got Talent’s strongest selling point.As the Dark Lord’s end-of-the-pier follies returned for a meaningless ninth series, who could recall last year’s winner? Anyone?I think it was another of those godawful classical opera groups that thoroughly unmodern Simon, 55, loves so much. Carcrashio or something.But who cares? Because, SuBo, Paul Potts and Diversity notwithstanding, BGT isn’t about ­propelling people to fame and fortune.No, this fun-packed programme’s principal purpose is to make us laugh by bombarding us with an 80-minute collection of crazy clips.Mission accomplished in the case of that hilarious hound Max who, instead of treating us to his amazing tricks, kept running off the stage to attack cowering Ant.Mad Max was the smash hit of the night. But not in a good way.Then we were supposed to give a damn when Cowell achieved his weird lifelong ambition of discovering a singing canine.Step forward French marvel-mutt Wendy. Who can’t sing. But can lower her jaw to order while ventriloquist Marc puts words into her mouth. Ooh la la.Quite why we had to endure stunned Simon theatrically phoning his lover to tell her the unastonishing news is a mystery.“Are you sitting down, Lauren?” he gasped. “A dog came in and sang!” David Walliams: “Well, it didn’t.” Exactly.Never mind. These are the best moments. When ITV’s annual search for an instantly forgotten nobody doesn’t take itself too ­seriously.The worst bits involve all four judges adopting their lost-in-wonder expressions as some ­mediocre wannabe proves to be halfway proficient at a daft act that will never make the mainstream.Doe-eyed duo Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon both have the impressive ability to look as if they’re close to tears.Occasionally, it almost seems genuine.After that massive Welsh choir Ysgol Glanaethwy (usual spelling) completed their passable performance you’d have thought Cowell and the standing ovation gang had just witnessed the Second Coming.Then, of course, there were the comedy losers who were sacrificed on the altar of mass entertainment.The comb player, the dummy with the vulture dummy, the cello biddies, chicken woman...Only Syco Simon believes this ritual humiliation is TV gold. In fact, it’s not very funny, horribly cruel and embarrassingly old-fashioned. Make it stop.Meanwhile, how long did it take them to edit the carefully choreographed brilliant brother/useless sister sequence?Pinky & Perky sound-alike Calum Scott wasn’t that great. Nor was his sobbing sibling Jade that bad. But what a trumped-up golden buzzer story!Pretend spontaneous drama is what he does.That and repeating “a big fat yes” every five minutes. Can’t the big fat cliché king think of any-thing else to say?And last but certainly least... WTF were those scantily clad large ladies thinking?After Ms Dixon waffled on about “empowering women”, Simon insisted: “This is one of the best acts I’ve seen.” Yeah right. Let’s face it... they were rubbish.But what the hell. At least ­Britain’s Got Talent doesn’t change lives. Better still, unlike The X Factor, it doesn’t ruin them either...
Runners are pounding the footpaths this morning as part of the Tauranga Half Marathon.Runners take part in the Tauranga Half Marathon today. Photos by: Cameron Avery.Today marks one decade of the event gracing Tauranga City's streets, bringing with it a record number of participants keen on being part of history.In the running stakes, the men's elite half marathon field looks stronger than ever with last year's top two place-getters, locals Kyle and Iain MacDonald, returning.They will be pushed hard by a number of top performers including Jono Jackson from Auckland, a NZ representative mountain runner and multiple NZ championships medal winner over 10,000m.Jackson has a best half marathon of 67 minutes – one minute-and-a-half better than the MacDonald twins.The women's favourites appear to be last year's second place-getter Jess Ruthe who should be challenged by Aucklander Kelly Parlane, a consistent performer at national level distance running events.As well as the Half Marathon distance, there are also 14km, 7km and one mile (1.7km) options for those seeking a slightly shorter challenge.The first finishers are expected to cross the line at Fergusson Park about 8.10am. Other events will run throughout the morning, with the final event – the Matua Mile – at 10.30am.

Birmingham City midfielder has sparked a Twitter storm by taking a swipe at the fans of his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers .The 23-year-old made the switch from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer after falling out-of-favour at the club.After the St Andrew's victory over Wolves, he couldn't resist a dig at the club he left behind.The tweet sparked quite the response on Twitter from angry Wolves fans.
VANCOUVER — As far as $100 doughnuts go, Jeanne Kaminski believes the Donutopia is a good deal.The doughnut — the humble fried confectionary of the masses — has been blinged out to the extreme at West Kelowna’s Dolicious Donuts.“Each one takes three to five hours to make. The value of the doughnut is more than $100,” said Dolicious owner Kaminski, co-creator of the lavish delicacy.The Donutopia, which rests in a sugar bowl and is decorated with 24-karat gold flakes and edible sugar “diamonds,” starts with the same simple, yet secret, 40-year-old recipe that Dolicious uses for all its doughnuts. The one difference is that the batter is made with Bling H20, a “luxury water” with a sale price that starts at $29 per 200ml bottle.“I saw it at Urban Fare and it said it was from the mountains of Tennessee. Now, I am from Tennessee so I knew that must be damn good water,” Kaminski said.Pinot Gris ice wine has been added to the cream filling, and the chocolate icing is infused with imported balsamic vinegar.“There are also gold flakes in the vinegar,” Kaminski noted.While the Donutopia may be the priciest doughnut in British Columbia, it’s a bargain compared to the £1,000 ($1,850) Dom Pérignon jelly Berliner served at a Krispy Kreme in England last year as part of a charity fundraiser during the U.K.’s national doughnut week.Kaminski’s extreme doughnut was conceived when a regular customer asked for a special doughnut to hide an engagement ring and then proposed to his fiancée inside the bakery.“It was such a happy thing that we came up with the Donutopia,” said Kaminski, who has sold just one of the $100 doughnuts, but has taken orders for several more.She said all proceeds from sales of the Donutopia are going toward the establishment of a soup kitchen in West Kelowna.
Abidjan – Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara inaugurated, on Saturday in Abidjan, an express way named after “King Mohammed VI”.The inauguration ceremony of the 4.6 kilometer expressway linking the communes of Abobo and Anyama was notably attended by Foreign Minister who was representing HM the King.The road was completed at a total cost of 13.5 million Euros and will be serving 1.8 million inhabitants of the two communes.Speaking on this occasion, the Ivorian President highlighted the longstanding ties of friendship and brotherhood between Morocco and Côte d’Ivoire.He said that naming the road after HM King Mohammed VI is a sign of appreciation and recognition to the Moroccan Sovereign for his “engagement to boost cooperation between the two countries.”In this respect, President Ouattara highlighted the importance of the projects implemented in his country with Moroccan support.Speaking on the same occasion, Mezouar said that naming the expressway after King Mohammed VI reflects “sincere friendship and brotherhood” and mirrors the willingness of the Ivorian president and HM the King to add fresh momentum to bilateral relations.Join the Conversation.

Details have emerged of how a gang pulled off an audacious jewellery heist by making off with the loot in wheelie bins.Astonishing CCTV footage shows the raiders breaking into a safe deposit box company where they spent two nights drilling through a reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault.Police issued nine still images from the CCTV cameras last night in an attempt to trace the jewel thieves.They stole an estimated £60 million in gems, cash and other valuable items, which they stuffed into wheelie bins before loading them on to the back of a Ford Transit van.The video footage was obtained from two cameras – one positioned on the street and the other by the rear fire exit through which the raiders gained entry to the premises of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company.Piecing together more than 120 hours of coverage from the two cameras, detectives have been able to build up a detailed picture of just how the raid was carried out.Det Chief Insp Paul Johnson said: “They were highly audacious, entering on two occasions over that weekend.“This footage along with other material continues to be evaluated to capture the precise movements of the suspects.”Police said that 72 of the 999 safe deposit boxes were opened. Of those, seven were empty. Police have so far contacted 42 owners while trying to reach the remaining victims.It is thought that one member of the gang may have hidden inside the building in order to let others in through a fire exit.Alternatively, they had assistance from a worker on the premises, home to a number of companies.The camera outside the fire-exit door shows the first member of the gang – a man dubbed Mr Ginger on account of his red hair – arrive at about 8.20pm on Thursday April 2, just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit company had locked up for the Easter bank holiday.The men reached the fire exit through an alley that leads from a side street in Hatton Garden, London’s famous jewellery quarter.But the alley itself is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key to get through that, too. Police have said there was no evidence of a forced entry into the Hatton Garden premises.To reach the door they would have also needed a further key to get past a metal gate that led from the rear alley on to the street.At 8.27pm, a white van pulled up in the side street around the corner from the company’s front door and the gang unloaded wheelie bins from the back of the van.It is thought the wheelie bins contained power tools including a diamond-tipped drill for boring through the 7ft concrete wall and into the basement vault.The CCTV footage suggests there were at least six members of the gang, given the nicknames Mr Ginger, Mr Montana, the Old Man, the Tall Man, the Gent and Mr Strong, based on physical features or clothing glimpsed from the footage. Mostly, the men hid beneath hats, caps and balaclavas.The footage suggests they took about 20 minutes on Thursday evening to move tools into the building, taking them down the alley and in through the rear fire exit.The gang then disabled the lift on the second floor of the communal office building and descended into the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safety deposit boxes were kept in the company’s vault.The footage shows the men remained inside the premises for about seven hours.At just after midnight on Good Friday, they triggered the intruder alarm, but police decided no response was required – a decision that is now under internal investigation.The thieves used a Hilti 350 diamond coring drill to gain access to the vaultDuring the night, the men began their attempt to break into the vault, prising open steel shutters into the company’s offices before beginning the drilling operation.The footage then shows them emerging into daylight at about 7.50am on Good Friday before getting into the white van and driving off.They returned to the crime scene just after 10.15pm on Saturday and went back to work.The footage then shows them re-emerging at the fire exit at just after 6am on Easter Sunday, struggling with a wheelie bin that is thought to be crammed full of cash and gems stolen from safe deposit boxes. Other wheelie bins were also dragged to the van.Police have refused to put a value on the stolen goods but estimates say the figure is more than £60 million.Detectives are investigating a number of specific leads, not least because only a few gangs are capable of pulling off such a crime. It is likely the men have left the country and disposed of the gems.Given how well planned the raid was, it seems likely that the men had already worked out what to do with the stolen items.One outfit thought to be on the list of targets is the Pink Panther gang, which has carried out a number of international jewel raids.The Pink Panthers were given their nickname after a diamond ring they had stolen from a London jeweller’s was found hidden in a jar of face cream. They had borrowed the idea for concealing the gem from a plotline in the 1975 Peter Sellers film The Return of the Pink Panther.A leading member of the gang – a Bosnian called Milan Popari – has been on the run since breaking out of a Swiss jail in 2013. He was the third member to be sprung from prison that year.The Pink Panthers have raided jewellers not only in Britain but also in the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Switzerland, France and Monaco.In Dubai, they used black and white Audi limousines to drive across the polished floors of an upmarket shopping mall, where they smashed the front window of a jewellery store.In Tokyo, they took just 36 seconds to steal £2 million worth of gems from a store.Police in France are also investigating whether the gang is behind a £6.4million gems heist involving two security lorries last month.20.19, Thursday, April 2 Staff at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, which provides “secure” storage for their clients’ “irreplaceable personal belongings”, lock up for the Easter weekend. The company, normally opens Monday to Friday, is not due to reopen until Tuesday morning because of the bank holiday. Hatton Garden, in which many Jewish-run diamond jewellers operate, is especially quiet because Easter coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover20.23 Four minutes later, the gang moves in. CCTV footage, made public yesterday, shows the first gang member arriving at a rear fire-exit door, reached through a narrow alley. Police later confirm there was no sign of forced entry. Dubbed Mr Ginger because of his red hair, seen beneath a black cap, the man wears latex gloves, a blue jacket and dark trousers. He is carrying a black bin bag20.27 A second CCTV camera captures a white Ford Transit van driving down Greville Street, around the corner from the front entrance to Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. It pulls up at the entrance to the side alley that offers access to a rear fire exit door into the communal building housing the safe deposit boxes. Men drag wheelie bins down the alley before the van leaves20.30 A second gang member, nicknamed the Gent because of his smart brown shoes, arrives carrying a large holdall. He has on a balaclava, a hard hat and a high-visibility jacket20.31 The gang member dubbed Mr Strong appears at the back door. He has steel supports and wears a hard hat. The supports may serve to hold in place the diamond-tipped drill used to break into the vault. Mr Strong and the Gent then carry more tools into the building20.36 A fourth man appears. Wearing a black sweatshirt bearing the words “Montana 93”, the man – Mr Montana – enters the building. He and Mr Strong drag in wheelie bins. One is thought to contain the 77lb drill used to bore through a 7ft reinforced concrete wall giving access to the basement vaults00.21, Friday April 3 An intruder alarm is set off at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company contacts the Metropolitan Police’s Central Communications Command. Police record the call but decide no response is needed – a decision now being internally investigated01.00 Mr Ginger is seen by the back door. There is no more movement above ground for almost seven hours. Inside the building, the gang disable the lift, leaving it on the second floor. They use the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safe deposit boxes are held. They force open shutter doors into the company’s offices and bore holes into the vault wall using a Hilti DD350 drill07.51 The gang resurface after a night inside the premises. Mr Ginger leaves with two purple holdalls. Mr Montana carries out two red tool boxes. Footage shows him with a shaved head and possibly an earring. A minute later, the Gent briefly appears with a red monkey wrench and bolt cutters08.02 The Gent emerges again with a black bucket of tools. Mr Montana and Mr Strong come up and put the tools in a bag08.05 CCTV gives a first glimpse of the Old Man, a grey-haired gang member, who emerges from the side doorA white van used in the Hatton Garden raid (Met Police/PA)08.12 The white transit van pulls up in the alley. The gang load it with tools and drive off. Saturday is a normal working day and the streets around Hatton Garden will be busier than on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The gang are not seen again on CCTV for 38 hoursMr Ginger is back, again wearing latex gloves and carrying a black bin bag22.32 CCTV captures a first glimpse of the Tall Man. He wears a flat cap and carries a blue Nike bag and a red tool box. The Old Man joins him. No other gang members are seen and for the next seven hours the gang drill through the vault walls, forcing open up to 70 safe deposit boxes05.46, Sunday April 5 The Tall Man, wearing an adidas top, emerges from the fire exit door carrying two red tools06.01 Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and the Old Man drag a wheelie bin outside.

Five Houthis and two local fighters died, residents said.Locals said Houthi forces were shelling civilian areas and trying to push into the Tawahi district, one of the only areas where they have no presence and home to a presidential palace and the city's military port.While the Houthis deny getting help from Shi'ite Iran and say their armed campaign is designed to stamp out corruption and Sunni al Qaeda militants, Saudi Arabia and its allies describe them as an Iranian-backed threat to regional security.The United Nations says the conflict, in which the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in northern Yemen in September, has killed 600 people, wounded 2,200 and displaced 100,000 others.Saudi Arabia's Defence Ministry statement said more than 500 Houthis had also been killed in fighting on Yemen's border with the kingdom since the conflict began, but it did not say how it arrived at that figure.
A transplant survivor has honoured a promise to his bone marrow donor almost one quarter of a century later – by inviting his lifesaver to watch him walk his daughter down the aisle.Sales manager, Ian Brown, 59, from Morpeth in Northumberland, saved Rick Haines’ life by donating bone marrow to him in 1991.Thanks to the donation, Mr Haines will be able to see his daughter Marissa, now 27, get married next month.Mr Brown said: “Before his bone marrow transplant, Rick had little chance of survival and his greatest sorrow was that he would never have the opportunity to walk his little girl – who was four at the time - down the aisle.“He asked me many years ago as to how he could ever repay me for donating the bone marrow that saved his life, and my answer was to let me see that very thing happen.”Next month Mr Brown and his wife will attend the wedding in the United States as very special guests.He joined the Anthony Nolan register in the late 1980s when his baby son Michael - now 33 - was being treated for cancer.A few years later, in 1991, he received a call to tell him that he was a match for a patient in the USA who was in desperate need of a transplant.Mr Brown agreed to donate and travelled to the Harley Street Clinic in London to make the lifesaving donation.He gave his bone marrow on the morning of May 17, 1991, and it was immediately picked up by a courier who flew over to the USA on Concorde, on a journey of more than 3,500 miles, which allowed the patient to have his transplant that evening.Mr Brown said: “It was so rewarding – after making the donation, I went round with a huge smile on my face for six months.”Following the donation, the sales manager learned that his bone marrow had gone to a 44-year-old man called Rick Haines who lived in Delaware and who was suffering from aplastic anaemia.Afterwards, Mr Haines, an engineer in the motor industry, contacted Mr Brown to thank him.Mr Haines, now 68, explained that he had feared he would not live to see his young daughter walk down the aisle, and a deal was struck.• Donor organs from cancer patients should be transplanted despite risks• People who agree to donate their organs could be given NHS priorityThe men met for the first time in 1996 when the Browns flew out to America, and have since had family holidays together.Now, Mr Brown will fly to Pennsylvania to see Mr Haines' daughter Marissa marry her fiancé Dustin on May 9.The sales manager, who was widowed in 2011, will be marrying his partner, Lorraine Scott, in Durham the week before so will be attending the wedding as part of their honeymoon.Mr Brown said: “It is like a completion of the story. I am quite an emotional person and I am sure it will be an amazing moment to see Rick walk down the aisle with Marissa after all of these years.”Around 2,000 people in the UK need a bone marrow transplant from a stranger each year, often as a result of blood cancers such as leukaemia, and other disorders which affect the blood.Around one quarter of people have the same tissue type as a sibling, but the majority of patients need a donation from a stranger.Most donations take place via a four-hour outpatient appointment, with a machine withdrawing blood from one arm, separating the stem cells, and returning the blood through the other arm.In 10 per cent of cases the stem cells are taken from the bone marrow in the hip; this is done under general anaesthetic.The difficulty is finding a match: only one in 1,200 people who join the register get asked to donate, rising to one in 300 for young men.Last year a young bride-to-be launched a desperate appeal to find her fiancé a life-saving stem cell donor in just 60 days as he battled leukaemia, and found a match after seeing her campaign go viral on social media.Kate Robertson launched the Shake4mike appeal in her race against the clock to source a donor for Mike Brandon.The pair had just two months to find a donor after being told Mr Brandon must undergo a transplant as soon as he had finished his next course of chemotherapy.Anthony Nolan, the world’s first bone marrow register, has been matching donors to patients for more than four decades.The charity is urgently seeking more young men aged 16-30 to sign up, as they are most likely to be chosen to donate but make up just 15 per cent of the register.In 2013 a 17-year-old sixth former became the youngest ever donor to register on their list.Currently, only 60 per cent of transplant recipients receive the best possible match, dropping to just 21 per cent among those of a black, Asian or ethnic minority background, the charity’s figures show.If you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health, you can join the Anthony Nolan register here.
When Zara Phillips found husband Mike Tindall had bought a quarter share in racehorse Monbeg Dude at an auction in 2010 she reportedly called him an "idiot".The horse cost former England rugby international Tindall and three friends £12,000 but turned out to be a poor jumper of fences.However, Ms Phillips, daughter of the Princess Royal and an Olympic equestrian competitor, changed her mind after spending some time training the horse. And Tindall’s luck was in as the horse romped home in third place at the Grand National , netting £105,500 in prize money.Winning the Grand National is a feat which neither the Queen nor the late Queen Mother, both successful racing horse owners, have achieved.The only occasion on which a Royal has won the National was back in 1900 when the Prince of Wales's horse, Ambush II was victorious.A number of other famous names have owned the National winner including comedian Freddie Starr (Miinnehoma, 1994) and Anne, the Duchess of Westminster, (Last Suspect, 1985).The National also proved to be a historic day for jockey Leighton Aspell who rode Pineau de Re to victory last year.Aspell achieved a remarkable back to back victory, winning the world-famous race for a second year in a row on Many Clouds and landing the prize money of £561,300.The 38-year-old, who once retired from the saddle, held off Saint Are by a length and three-quarters.Aspell said after the race: “That was awesome. Many Clouds is a tired boy, he gave his all like he always does but what a wonderful ride round. It was all guts.”Much loved veteran jockey Tony McCoy came in fifth on Shutthefrontdoor in his final National, which was watched by an estimated nine million viewers in the UK and 600 million worldwide.While McCoy had his hopes of victory dashed, bookmakers were left smiling as they dodged an estimated £60 million payout if he’d won.Shutthefrontdoor ‘s trainer Jonjo O'Neill said: "He ran a blinder. He did everything right, he was following the right horses but unfortunately he wasn't good enough on the day and maybe he didn't get the trip."It's good news, at least I've got AP (McCoy) for a couple more weeks (before retirement)."Overall, up to £165 million worth of bets were estimated to have been placed on the Grand National. Bookmaker William Hill said it would be paying out £13 million to the 200,000 lucky punters who backed Many Clouds, which returned at odds of 25/1.Aspell’s victory marked the first time that a jockey had won two Nationals in a row since Brian Fletcher triumphed on the legendary Red Rum in 1973 and 1974.The last time a jockey landed in first place two years in a row on different horses was Bryan Marshall who won on Early Mist in 1953 and Quare Times in 1955.No jockey has ridden the Grand National winner three years in a row and William Hill promptly offered odds of 14/1 that Aspell does it again next year.Aspell had retired from racing at just 31 years of age in 2007, but changed his mind two years later. He’s not the oldest jockey ever to win the race – that was Dick Saunders at 48, when he partnered Grittar to victory in 1982.It was a third Grand National win for Many Clouds’ owner, Trevor Hemmings, who said: "Seriously, it was incredible. You come to the National and you dream that you win it."When a third comes along, that is something special. It is a wonderful, wonderful feeling."For years and years this race has captured my heart. What a wonderful feeling, you can't express it."Thank you [trainer] Oliver Sherwood, thank you Leighton and all the staff, and, of course, Aintree."Mr Sherwood said after the win: "I can't believe it. I thought it was a year too early and that Many Clouds might have gone over the top. What do I know about horses?"It is only the third time in history that an owner has won the Grand National three times.The first was James Machell who triumphed in 1873 with Disturbance, 1874 with Reugny and in 1876 with Regal.The second was Noel Le Mare with Red Rum in 1973, 1974 and 1977.Many Clouds was described as "wobbly" after the race and taken away to cool down but quickly recovered.All 39 horses were said to be fine following the tough race despite a number of falls and only 19 horses finishing, according to Channel Four which broadcast the race.There were protests by animal rights activists prior to the race, including from Animal Aid, a campaign group that wants to see the National abolished.A protester scaled the Gift Horse statue in Trafalgar Square in London on behalf of Animal Aid, and wrapped it in a banner reading “Horse racing: you bet, they die.”The director of Animal Aid, Andrew Tyler, said the daring protest, at 6am, aimed to draw attention to the dangers faced by horses racing in the National.“The green banner is representative of the green screens behind which race horses are shot on racecourses,” said Mr Tyler. “The statue, by Hans Hacke, was chosen because the skeletal sculpture reminds us of the horses who are victims of the racing industry.”Green screens were placed around one faller, Balthazar King. The horse survived and was reported to have been transported to a veterinary hospital with suspected broken ribs.Mr Tyler said: "Watching the race I was feeling so distressed. Anyone who loves and cares for horses is going to be deeply distressed by watching that. It's a wicked perverse spectacle that horses should never have to be subjected to. Balthazar King got up by pure good fortune, which was good news."
Like many other girls, all Lisa Gordon used to hope for was to marry a smart-looking guy who was dependable and had a steady job.When she met Keith it seemed her quest for a ­husband was over.He was ideal – older then her, ­sensible and an ­office worker who had a ­decent dress sense – the ­gentleman she was waiting for.But 14 years after they tied the knot she struggles to recognise the man she fell in love with. And she can barely stand the sight of him.Because in the past seven years Keith, 59, has become transformed from Mr Average to one of the most ­tattooed men in the country – ­covered in body art from head to toe.People stare at him whenever he goes out, which is tough for Lisa.Sensible: Keith and Lisa on their wedding day in 2002She told the Sunday People: “I would never have ­married him if he looked the way he does now. I always wanted a man who appears ­respectable and who the children can look up to.“Instead I look at him and I think, ‘What have I married?’“If I could get a magic wand I would wave it and take all the tattoos off. Sometimes I look at his face and try to remember what it used to be like when we met.”Lisa admits she treasures the ­moments when they are together with the lights out.“When we’re lying in bed in the dark I don’t see his tattoos.“I can touch his face and ­remember what he used to look like.“I feel like I’m sleeping with a monster in my bed.”Obsessed: Keith says his tattoos help him cope with OCDFor Keith, an admin worker, his wife’s refusal to ­accept the way he looks is hard to take. He said: “I don’t give a damn about what ­anyone else thinks about me.“The only thing that does upset me is Lisa not accepting my tattoos. It makes me sad.“She’s my wife and I do feel like she should support me. I’ve got enough haters.”He has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder for more than 40 years and claims his tattoos have helped him cope with it.Long-suffering Lisa has stuck by her man because she can see the ­difference the tattoos have made to his everyday life.She said: “I don’t like them but I know they make him ­happy. Before, he was depressed and suffered with OCD. He used to make me mad ­doing OCD stuff. Now he’s a lot calmer and happier.“Perhaps I shouldn’t care, because it makes me sound shallow.“But I just can’t bring myself to like the way they look.”Annoyed: Lisa can't come to terms with Keith's new lookLisa, originally from the Philippines, can’t help looking back and missing the man she met during her lunch break from a cleaning job in London’s upper-crust Sloane Square in 2001.She said: “I’d had a bad ­relationship. I realised I ­needed someone different – a bit more ­mature, someone older, who could look after me.“Keith was totally different from how he is now. He was wearing a shirt and trousers. He looked like a nice, simple guy.”Lisa was 29 and Keith 46 but ­despite the 16-year age difference she was smitten.A month after they started dating, Lisa told Keith about her one-year-old daughter Diana Rose back home in the Philippines.“He was so supportive and I knew I could depend on him.”And when they married in July 2002 Lisa was five months pregnant with their first child together, Jamie-Lee, now 11.She said: “It’s so strange when I look at the wedding photos. It’s like I married a different person.“The personality isn’t different, it’s the same. He’s always been a nice, lovely caring guy who has tried to make me happy.”The couple, who live in Romford, East London, ­settled into family life and had two more kids, Ricky, nine and Jennifer, six. All four children's names and ­birthdays are tattooed on Keith’s ­fingers.Lisa said: “Having ­children was an obsession for him. He wanted to start a family. I think it was linked to OCD.”Recalling the ­background to his ­habit, Lisa said: “Keith was ­always into heavy metal but he didn’t look like someone who was. He went to work looking smart in a suit and tie. When he played his music at home I just went to a ­different part of the house.“He always had the rock T-shirts but he didn’t really wear them. They stayed in the drawer.” But after their youngest child Jennifer was born in 2008, Keith’s rock side ­came to the fore.He decided to get a tattoo – a skull on his shoulder.It was the ­beginning of the end for his straight-laced ­image as he ­became hooked on his inking sessions. Lisa said: “When he told me he wanted it I was shocked and angry. I just didn’t like them.“I worried about what my family would think.”But undeterred, Keith has gone on to spend £15,000 on body art in the last seven years. Only his ribs and stomach remain to be covered and his hobby has been costing an average of £130 a month.Lisa said: “Now I think it was all part of his obsessive ­behaviour. He’d had ­children and after that he needed something new to focus on.“When he had his sleeves done it was sort of OK. People didn’t react to that. But when he got his face done I would go out and feel embarrassed.”What ­puzzled Lisa even more was that Keith had tattoos as a ­teenager – on both arms. But he had them removed when he was 20 as his OCD kicked in. Keith said: “It was a mental health ­issue. I had to have them removed on the NHS and for years I couldn’t stand to even see a tattoo.”Decades later, and on medication for depression, his impulse to have tattoos roared back.Today it is not all agony for his wife. As Keith’s tattoos have got him more attention, she admits to feeling the ­occasional ­glimmer of pride. Lisa said: “I used to be embarrassed when we went out but now I ­support him.“If someone on a bus says, ‘Look at him,’ I will make it clear we are ­together. I don’t hide. I’ve realised that I need to be his wife and be a ­supportive shoulder.”There are even some benefits.Family guy: Keith with Lisa and their childrenLisa said: “At least he doesn’t look old. Before, he did look older but now he looks younger. My friends can’t believe he’s almost 60. They think he’s 30 or 40.”“Sometimes Keith will point to an old guy with grey hair and say, ‘Do you want me to look like him?’“That’s the only time I think he maybe looks better.”Despite her dislike of his tattoos, the couple are still very much in love.Keith said: “We’re totally ­incompatible but it works. We don’t like anything the same. I like heavy metal but she likes Engelbert Humperdinck.”And although she thinks his tattoos are ugly – Lisa still fancies Keith.She laughed as she said: “Sometimes I don’t understand myself why I’ve stayed... when you look at what I ­married and what he looks like now.“But we’ve been together 14 years and we do love each other. He only looks like a lunatic, but he’s not.“He’s attractive to me because he’s my husband.“He may be a monster but he’s my monster.”
VANCOUVER - Most of the toxic bunker fuel that spilled into the waters of Vancouver's scenic English Bay has been cleaned up, and crews have shifted their focus to clearing the shoreline, officials say.Coast Guard assistant commissioner Roger Girouard said a Transport Canada flyover at sunset Friday saw only about six litres left in the water and most of it likely evaporated overnight.About 2,700 litres of the black oil spilled on Wednesday from the MV Marathassa, a Japanese-made ship on its maiden voyage to pick up grain from Vancouver.The location of the leak has now been identified as the hull outlet, and officials believe the brand new ship built to the latest standards suffered a malfunction.Divers have been out each day to ensure that no further pollution has been coming from the vessel, and marine safety inspectors have boarded the ship daily, said Yvette Myers of Transport Canada.But divers are not testing the water and it is not known if any fuel has sunk to the bottom of the bay."That a small amount of oil might accumulate around some flotsam, a piece of wood, or something weighted, is certainly within the range of possibility, but we don't expect any significant volumes to have gone down to the ocean floor, Girouard said.He added work will continue for several days to clean up the beaches, where he says soiling is relatively minor despite a couple of spots where oil coated some rocks.Crews have visited and assessed several spots on the shoreline, including the south shore of English Bay near Stanley Park, as well as Sandy Cove, the hardest-hit area in West Vancouver.No marine mammals in distress have been found, but several oiled birds have been captured and taken to refuge. Girouard said the "small number" of affected birds is proof of the coast guard's "successful" response.The coast guard has faced harsh criticism for its response to Wednesday's spill, including from British Columbia premier Christy Clark and Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, who called it "totally inadequate."While the initial report of pollution in the water came in at 5 p.m., the coast guard did not have an oil-absorbing boom in place until midnight and did not alert the city until 6 a.m. Thursday.Environmental groups and concerned residents gathered across the province on Saturday to call on Clark to pull out of the National Energy Board review process of Kinder Morgan's proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.The expansion would bring more tankers, some carrying diluted bitumen, to B.C.'s coast. One environmentalist at English Bay called the recent spill an "absolute wake-up call.""The handling of that has been really concerning, that we aren't prepared to deal with a relatively small spill of bunker fuel," said Alexandra Woodsworth of the Georgia Strait Alliance."If we can't deal with that, how can we deal with a massive spill of diluted bitumen?"Kinder Morgan sent a statement calling the spill an "unfortunate situation" it is watching closely but said it is unrelated to Trans Mountain.
A convicted murderer who murdered and dismembered his teenage victim has had boiling hot water thrown over him in an apparent revenge attack in a Scottish prison.William Beggs, 54, known as the Limbs in the Loch murderer, was described by police at the time of his conviction in 2001 as a 'serial killer in the making'.Beggs is serving a life sentence in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1999.The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond and his head was dumped in the sea off the Ayrshire coast.Beggs screamed in pain as boiling water was thrown over his face and hands in the cell attack, the Scottish Daily Record reported yesterday.The alleged attacker was due for release this year and has since been moved to Shotts Prison.He reportedly told friends he was taking revenge after Beggs attacked him soon after he arrived at the prison.It is understood Beggs was treated for burns in the prison's infirmary but did not need to attend hospital.Supermarket worker Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock.In 2001 a jury found Beggs took the teenager to his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault.He then murdered him and cut up his body.Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands.After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial.After the High Court jury delivered their majority verdict and found him guilty it was revealed Beggs was once cleared of a similar murder by appeal court judges on a technicality.Beggs was jailed in 1987 at Teeside Crown Court for murdering a barman he met in a gay nightclub by slashing his throat, only to have the conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal, the BBC reported at the time.The court also learned that at the same trial Beggs was convicted of two charges of wounding and sentenced to four months for each.He was also jailed for six years in 1991 for slashing the leg of a man who escaped by jumping through a glass window.Beggs has repeatedly tried and failed to have his conviction overturned at the Supreme Court.
Yasiel Puig, who appears to be in an early-season slump, will be on the bench Saturday when the Dodgers take on the Arizona Diamondbacks in the second game of a three-game series at Chase Field.In the Dodgers’ first four games, Puig was two for 17 with six strikeouts.Puig’s second hit of the season came Friday night in the 10th inning of the Dodgers’ 4-3 defeat to the Diamondbacks.Following the game, Manager Don Mattingly said, “I think Yas looks a little frustrated, honestly. More than anything, probably just trying too hard to get a hit.”Andre Ethier will start in right field in place of Puig.Justin Turner also will make his first start of the season, as he will be at third base instead of Juan Uribe.With Clayton Kershaw on the mound, A.J. Ellis will catch.
Nick Suzuki and Isaac Ratcliffe have been friends for nine years.They have grown up two minutes away from each other in Byron.On Saturday, the Jr. Knights teammates were picked back-to-back in the OHL draft -- Suzuki 14th overall to Owen Sound and Ratcliffe 15th to Guelph, the Midwest division rivals who just happened to meet in the first round of this year's playoffs."We didn't have a battle going on or anything (about which one of them would be selected first)," said Ratcliffe, the 6-foot-5, 183-pound winger heading to Storm City. "We're just happy for one another. We really developed a lot of chemistry and it's going to be hard not having a guy like that with me (in Guelph)."But I'm sure we'll develop a lot of new good friendships and chemistry with other players over the next few years."London loomed at pick No. 17. The Knights took big defenceman Evan Bouchard, who scored 18 goals in 35 games this season with the Oakville Rangers. He and Victor Mete could have an offensive field day together next year.GM Basil McRae never got a crack at the two star hometown boys."I'm excited to be part of Owen Sound," said Suzuki, the skilled centre who was on the Attack's radar enough to go to the Bayshore last month to watch a game. "It would be great to play in London, but we're in the same division so we'll be playing the Knights a lot."It should be fun."Suzuki and Ratcliffe were vital parts of Ontario's Canada Winter Games gold medal in Prince George, B.C., this year. They capped their important minor midget campaign with a stirring run to the OHL Cup semifinal round."First, going to B.C. to play with that great group of guys was amazing," Ratcliffe said, "and at the OHL Cup, we really turned some heads and found a few shocked faces in the crowd. After our team did that, everyone was excited to see where they would go (in the draft)."Ilderton's Shane Bulitka was the top Elgin-Middlesex Chief, landing in Sudbury in the second round (28th overall). Aidan Hughes, the huge Jr. Knights stopper who had a great combine, went 34th overall to Sarnia.He was the second goaltender picked in this draft.Now, all of the 15- and 16-year-olds are back to square one again."The draft is so unpredictable," Ratcliffe said. "I wasn't expected too much and wanted to come in with a clear mind. It's up to me to go out, play next year and show myself well."I'm really excited to start my journey.The Knights, who need their top picks to show up after failing to attract Americans Zach Werenski and Max Jones the past two years, didn't get the two close buddies, but they grabbed their share of local talent.London picked Max Vinogradov, a super scorer, along with centre Alex Turko and defencemen Jordan Di Cicco in the first 10 rounds.1.

MONTE CARLO (MONACO) - While Andy Murray celebrates his weekend marriage, the rest of the ATP elite are girding for battle on the clay, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal leading the field as the Monte Carlo Masters which begins on Sunday.Murray, who moved back to third in the world after reaching the Miami final last weekend against on-form number one Djokovic, will delay the start of his clay campaign as he misses the European opening.Djokovic is riding a massive wave of form, with the Serb already winning the Australian Open and completing an historic third trophy double at Indian Wells and Miami.With his newborn son now on the road with the family and his tennis firing perfectly, the 27-year-old is totally content."It's just the beginning, I don't want to predict anything. I don't want to put some additional unnecessary pressure on myself," the Monte Carlo-based player said as the clay start drew closer."There is already a lot of expectations of course. Everywhere I go I have to deal with it."I could not ask for a better start of the season winning three big titles. Hopefully I'm able to use this for the clay courts."That's extremely important for me obviously leading up to French (the only Grand Slam he has never won).I feel good about myself right now on the court, and just going to take it slowly, one tournament at a time."Last year's finalist Federer is back after skipping Miami as a strategic move and getting in a training block at home with Austrian Dominic Thiem.Federer was beaten a year ago in the championship match by compatriot Stan Wawrinka, who won the title but has failed to solidify himself as a consistent top five contender.The Swiss takes the seventh seeding at the seaside Country Club.A major question mark has to hang over eight-time winner Rafael Nadal, the third seed who has not lifted the title here since 2012. Since winning his ninth Roland Garros ten months ago, the Spaniard’s only title was a small South American clay event in February.Nadal, his battered body now a constant issue, is trying to bounce back after poor hardcourt showings in the US, exiting in the Indian Wells quarters and third round in Miami.The 28-year-old has been back on the familiar clay at home in Mallorca and needs a deep run in the principality to help cement his fragile confidence.Canadian Milos Raonic takes the fourth seeding in a draw where the top eight seeds have byes.The big server is trailed by number five Spaniard David Ferrer, Czech Tomas Berdych on sixth seeding, with 2014 Grand Slam winners Wawrinka and Marin Cilic closing out the elite grouping.Missing will be Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, whose right wrist surgery comeback in Miami lasted for only one losing match. Japan's fourth-ranked Kei Nishikori is also not present.Frenchman Richard Gasquet is missing as he battles more back problems. But the French will have Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon in the mix.Americans have managed to actually cross the Atlantic, though the chances of hardcourters John Isner and Sam Querrey are minimal at best.Australian Bernard Tomic is back after wisdom teeth work while compatriot Nick Kyrgios is delaying his injury return until Barcelona next week.
PANAMA CITY - US President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro held unprecedented face-to-face talks in Panama on Saturday, ditching decades of Cold War-era antagonism in a historic effort to restore diplomatic ties.In the first substantive talks between leaders of both nations since 1956, Obama thanked Castro for his "spirit of openness," while the communist leader stressed that the negotiations will require patience.The talks were the climax of their surprise announcement on December 17 that, after 18 months of secret negotiations, they would seek to normalize relations between their two nations."This is obviously a historic meeting," said Obama, who spoke first after they sat down for their talks on the sidelines of the 35-nation Summit of the Americas.Obama declared that, after 50 years of policies that had not worked, "it was time for us to try something new."‎"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future," he said.After Obama spoke, the two men stood up and shook hands.Saying he agreed with everything Obama said, Castro said the two government can still have differences but "with respect of the ideas of the others.""We are willing to discuss everything but we need to be patient, very patient," he said.The two leaders had already made conciliator speeches moments earlier during the summit, sitting in an oval table with some 30 other regional leaders.US-Cuban tensions have vexed Washington's relations with the region for decades."This shift in US policy represents a turning point for our entire region," Obama said.As the US leader looked on, Castro declared: "President Obama is an honest man."But both leaders acknowledged that the two countries, as they negotiate to restore diplomatic relations that broke off in 1961, will continue to have disagreements.Obama cited the human rights situation in Cuba, while Castro renewed calls for the US Congress to lift a decades-old embargo."I think it's no secret, President Castro I'm sure would agree, that there will continue to be significant differences between our two countries," Obama said.It was Cuba's first time participating at the 21-year-old summit.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos summed up the mood, saying "an old obstacle in relations between Latin America and North America is being removed."US and Cuba diplomats have held negotiations to restore embassies since January.Cuba has demanded to be removed from a US list of state sponsors of terrorism before embassies can reopen, noting that this has blocked the country's access to bank credit.Castro told the summit that Obama was taking a "positive step" by reviewing his country's inclusion on the list.The White House indicated that Obama was not yet ready to decide whether to remove Havana from the blacklist, but that it could not rule out an announcement in Panama.Obama has urged the US Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba, which was imposed in 1962, barring most trade with the island as well as tourism.But as Obama sought to turn the page on Cold War-era tensions, US tensions with Venezuela also took the stage.Obama left the room to head to a bilateral meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro spoke to criticize him."I respect you, but I don't trust you, President Obama," Maduro said.He urged Obama to lift sanctions against Venezuelan officials accused of committing human rights abuses. The order has particularly irritated Maduro because it calls Caracas a US national security threat."I am willing to talk with President Obama about this issue with respect and sincerity whenever he wants," Maduro said.Maduro said he has publicly and privately sought to speak with Obama ever since the Venezuelan leader was elected two years ago, but his US counterpart "never answered the messages that I sent him."The White House sought to ease tensions ahead of the summit, saying it did not really believe that Venezuela posed a national security threat."The response has been forceful, rejecting the executive order and demanding its removal," Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa said."Our people will never again accept tutelage, meddling and intervention."
WOW FACTOR: Thomas and Emily McKenzie in an F-111 cockpit at Caloundra Airport during the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day. More photos on Page 42.THOMAS and Emily McKenzie were over the moon to have the chance to sit in an F-111 cockpit at the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day at Caloundra yesterday."It was very squishy, but it was pretty cool looking at all the controls," Thomas said."I really enjoyed looking at all the planes, especially the F-111."The engines were pretty good too."READ MORE OF THE LATEST SUNSHINE COAST NEWSSeveral hundred people attended the event, which featured a jumping castle, a demonstration by the Eudlo Fire Brigade, Second World War jeep rides, as well as more than 65 restored aircraft on display.Dad Stuart McKenzie was as excited as his children to be at the show."It's always nice for kids to look at the planes, and for me as well," he said."It's a fantastic place, even if you're not interested in planes."It brings back lots of memories being here."The highlight of the event was when eight engines and planes were fired up at once.QAM president Cameron Elmes said the day was a chance to show off the engines in action.He said volunteers had been overwhelmed with the amount of community support."It's been fantastic," he said."We've been trying to make it a more family-centric event."If you want a history of aviation, this is the place to be - hopefully we can build an interest in aviation too."QAM marketing and promotions manager Geoff Smith said the vibe at the event had been overwhelmingly positive."It's a very happy day," he said.He thanked the 90 volunteers who helped out at the centre.
The killing of Walter Scott by a police officer in South Carolina was motivated by "overt racism", mourners at his funeral have heard.Hundreds of people attended the service at the Ministries Christian Centre in North Charleston to remember the father-of-four, who was shot last week.Officer Michael Slager was charged with his murder, after a video of the shooting emerged.Reverend George Hamilton said Mr Slager was a disgrace to the police force.He told mourners: "We will not indict the entire law enforcement community for the act of one racist."Mr Scott's coffin was draped with an American flag and flanked by members of his family as it entered the church on Saturday.Chairs were placed outside to accommodate the large number of people who turned out for the service.The 50-year-old was shot several times as he ran away from Mr Slager, who had initially reprimanded him for a broken rear light on his car.His relatives said Mr Scott probably fled from the officer out of fear of being jailed over missed child support payments.The shooting occurred as heightened scrutiny is being placed on police officer shootings, particularly those that involve white officers and unarmed black suspects.Tyrone Johnson, who went to school with Mr Scott, described him as a friendly person, who "never met an enemy"."There are a lot of people out here, just paying their respects to him and his legacy," he added.Mr Slager has been held without bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder.
DARREN Bent admitted Derby County "weren't at the races" against Brentford - but believes his last-gasp equaliser could yet prove key in their promotion bid. Bent struck in the second minute of stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw for the Rams at the iPro Stadium on Saturday. Brentford had led for much of the match and missed several chances to kill the game off - and leapfrog their opponents in the Championship table. As it is, Derby remain fifth, a point ahead of the Bees, who are just outside the play-off zone with four games to go. While the Rams' automatic promotion hopes continue to fade, they remain in contention for a top-six finish. "We didn't play well but we've managed to nick a point," said Bent. "That point could be massive come the end of the season. "We weren't at the races but we should take confidence from the fact that we stayed in it right to the end and showed great character. "We know full well we weren't at our best but you've got to give Brentford credit, too. "They dominated large periods of the game and made it difficult for us. "If you look at the game, in the grand scheme of things, it's a fantastic result, because we could easily have come away with nothing."Follow us on Facebook and Twitter

Praise: Strauss has hailed Pietersen as the best player he's ever played withAndrew Strauss has put any personal issues with Kevin Pietersen to one side and revealed KP is the best cricketer he's ever played with.The former England pair didn't share a good relationship during their time in the international setup and KP infamously criticised his captain via text messages to South African players in 2012.Pietersen hasn't played for England since January 2014 but Strauss reckons, out of all the talented players he played with, that KP is the best."In terms of being able to do things that other cricketers couldn’t, in the England side while I was involved he [Pietersen] was the one guy that stood out for me," revealed Strauss on the Lord's podcast.However, despite lauding Pietersen for his ability, Strauss reckons the ECB will be taking a step backwards if they give him an international recall."It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation," added Strauss."That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than actually him playing or not, it's become that big."The ECB and England’s team efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far, [but] by winning, that will allow them to move forward."If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after this Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side."You’re building to the next Ashes in two and half years time and the World Cup in 2019."I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time."
Gunmen have killed 20 construction workers in Pakistan's restive south-western province of Baluchistan.The men were shot at point blank range after identifying where they were from, officials said today.The area is plagued by violence, with separatists seeking greater control over the province's rich oil, gas and mineral resources.Gunmen have previously targeted outsiders seen as settlers."Armed gunmen stormed the camp of labourers in Gokh Don area of Baluchistan late Friday night and killed 20 labourers," senior police official Tariq Khilji told AFP news agency.He said those killed were all from outside the province, 16 of them from Punjab and four from Sindh province.The incident, which occurred around 1,050km southwest of Quetta, was confirmed by Akbar Hussain Durrani, a senior administration official in the province."The labourers were working on construction of a small local bridge," he said.Mr Hussain said some of the workers reported being woken from their sleep by the sound of gunshots and screams."They had lined them up and shot them at point blank range after identifying their identity," he said.He said paramilitary troops were guarding the workers but fled when confronted by a large number of armed attackers.Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident but Mr Hussain said insurgents have attacked non-Baluch settlers in the area in the past.Human rights groups have long accused Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies of serious abuses in Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest but least populous province.The security services deny the allegations and say they are battling a fierce rebellion in the province.
A gorse fire that was threatening thousands of acres of Killarney National Park has been extinguished.The fire at the foot of Mangerton Mountain had been burning since Thursday.The fire had spread over several kilometres due to the dry conditions.A spokesperson for Kerry Fire and Rescue told RTÉ News the fire was extinguished at 9.30pm last night.Around 20 firefighters deployed from Killarney and nearby towns Kenmare and Castleisland had been fighting the gorse fire.An air corps helicopter also assisted in fighting the fire, which is believed to be one of the largest to ever take hold inside the National Park.Hundreds of trees have been scorched by the fire and there has also been major loss, temporarily, of important habitats, according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.In a statement, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys said she expects to receive a detailed report on the damage caused to the woodlands and wildlife from the NPWS next week.

Steve Bruce remains confident that Hull can stave off relegation, despite leaving Southampton off the back of an all too familiar defeat.Last season's run to the FA Cup final and Premier League safety is a distant memory for City fans as their side slide worryingly close to a Championship return.The latest blow came at St Mary's, where James Ward-Prowse and Graziano Pelle ended long goal droughts as Southampton withstood an impressive start from Hull to secure a 2-0 win.Sone Aluko proved a nuisance and Jake Livermore forced Kelvin Davis into a save early in the second half, yet the inability to capitalise saw the match play out in a way Bruce has unfortunately become accustomed to."Well, we expected them to be better," the Tigers boss said of Southampton."Livermore has hit a screaming shot from 18 yards where the goalkeeper, to be fair to Kelvin, has made terrific save and then we have given a poor goal away, which is not like us."When in the ascendency like we were, you have to score, you have to take advantage of that situation."Apart from the first half against Swansea, against Chelsea the week before that and today we've been in the game and given ourselves a chance."If we take one of them chances, I am still convinced we have enough to stay in this division but obviously we're in the fight like everybody else."Despite still hovering just above the bottom three, Hull are many people's favourites to get sucked into the relegation zone due to their unenviable last six fixtures.Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all come to the KC Stadium before the season is out, while trips to fellow strugglers Burnley and revitalised Crystal Palace await."Listen, Sunderland today would be thinking they've got chance against Crystal Palace at home and get beat by four," Bruce said."We've got four games out of six at home and we have to win a couple of them, in my opinion, and might have to do a bit more than that."We've certainly got an opportunity no matter who we play against as we're at home."Going to Southampton, Swansea, Leicester, they're all not easy. That's why we're in the position we are in."We are finding it difficult but I'm still convinced we can beat three others. It'll be difficult but I still remain positive we can do it."Bruce had no complaints about the decision to award a penalty against son Alex, but was irritated that Pelle's forearm on him only warranted a yellow card.That decision allowed the Italy international to eventually end his long wait for a Premier League goal and wrap up the win, much to the delight of Saints manager Ronald Koeman."The last goal was in December," he said. "It's a long time ago."It wasn't a discussion, it wasn't a question how he is playing because he showed his qualities to be a strong target man, but if you are a striker you like to score and you need to score and it will help him a lot the second goal."The opener here came from England Under-21s midfielder Ward-Prowse, with the converted penalty representing his first-ever league goal.It was an impressive finish from the 20-year-old substitute and an opportunity Sadio Mane attempted to deny him, claiming the ball only to see it wrestled away from him."I was surprised because everybody knows if Proswey is on the pitch and normally Dusan (Tadic) and they are the first and the second choice to take the penalty," Koeman said."I had to shout to Jose (Fonte) to change that because it looks that Sadio was taking the penalty and Prowsey accepted that."I don't understand that because he knows the first choice. It was a difficult situation, a difficult situation, but I had to do it."That's the problem about Mane. The rules in the team are more important and nothing else."
PANAMA CITY - President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro sat down together Saturday in the first formal meeting of the two country's leaders in a half-century, pledging to reach for the kind of peaceful relationship that has eluded their nations for generations.In a small conference room in a Panama City convention centre, the two sat side by side in a bid to inject fresh momentum into their months-old effort to restore diplomatic ties. Reflecting on the historic nature of the meeting, Obama said he felt it was time to try something new and to engage with both Cuba's government and its people."What we have both concluded is that we can disagree with a spirit of respect and civility," Obama said. "And over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries."Castro, for his part, said he agreed with everything Obama had said — a stunning statement in and of itself for the Cuban leader. But he added the caveat that they had "agreed to disagee" at times. Castro said he had told the Americans that Cuba was willing to discuss issues such as human rights and freedom of the press, maintaining that "everything can be on the table.""We are disposed to talk about everything — with patience," Castro said in Spanish. "Some things we will agree with, and others we won't."And nothing is static, he added, noting that disagreements today could turn into areas of agreement tomorrow. "The pace of life at the present moment in the world — it's very fast."Not since 1958 have a U.S. and Cuban leader convened a substantial meeting. Dwight Eisenhower and Fulgencio Batista met that year, and the following year, former Cuban President Fidel Castro met with Richard Nixon, who was vice-president at the time.But relations quickly entered into a deep freeze amid the Cold War, and the U.S. spent decades trying to either isolate or actively overthrow the Cuban government.In a stroke of coincidence, Eisenhower's meeting with Batista in 1958 also took place in Panama, imbuing Saturday's session between Obama and Castro with a sense of having come full circle.The historic gathering played out on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas, which this year included Cuba for the first time. Although the meeting wasn't publicly announced in advance, White House aides had suggested the two leaders were looking for an opportunity to meet while in Panama and to discuss the ongoing efforts to open embassies in Havana and Washington, among other issues.In his brief remarks to reporters at the start of the meeting, Obama acknowledged that Cuba, too, would continue raising concerns about U.S. policies — earning a friendly smirk from Castro."We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future, and leave behind some of the circumstances of the past that have made it so difficult for our countries to communicate," Obama said.The flurry of diplomacy, which kicked off Friday evening with an historic handshake between Obama and Castro, was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their delicate plan to restore normal relations between their countries. The two presidents sent shockwaves throughout the hemisphere in December when they announced the plan for rapprochement, and their envoys have spent the ensuing months working through thorny issues such as sanctions, the re-opening of embassies and Cuba's place on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.Although earlier in the week Obama suggested a decision to remove Cuba from the list was imminent, he didn't say Saturday whether he would move ahead with that step. The U.S. State Department recently concluded a review recommending Cuba be taken off the list, fueling speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit to announce the move.Removal from the terror list is a top priority for Castro because it would not only purge a stain on Cuba's pride, but also ease its ability to conduct simple financial transactions.Associated Press writers Nedra Pickler, Darlene Superville and Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report.Reach Kuhnhenn at http://www.twitter.com/jkuhnhenn and Lederman at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAPBy Jim Kuhnhenn And Josh Lederman, The Associated Press
Nairobi, Kenya: It was a week of reckoning for motorists in Nairobi as the county government and the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) attempted to ease traffic congestion by introducing new traffic patterns that were praised and condemned in equal measure.The measures, targeted at removing roundabouts between Westlands and Nyayo Stadium, are in the long term being seen as the panacea to Nairobi’s perennial traffic gridlock. But as Eng Njuguna Gatitu of Kenha, a member of the committee entrusted with implementation of the new measures, admits, it was a week of hits and misses.“We have encountered challenges, but on the whole the measures are working. We have had success particularly with the Westlands section, but there have been major challenges around Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts,” he said.Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko on Friday dismissed the new measures and called for an immediate return to the roundabouts mode.Saying the changes had worsened traffic flow in the city, Sonko urged Governor Evans Kidero and the Roads ministry to rescind the decision or else “we will mobilise residents and they will wake up one day and find traffic flowing freely”.Although the new measures are targeted at discouraging drivers from making right turns at the roundabouts and compel them to drive further up the road to make U-turns, the decision created gridlocks at Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts with the ripple effect being felt kilometres away.This, according to motorists and civil engineers, is because first, there was little public education about the measures and secondly, drivers were adjusting to the new traffic patterns on the go.“Motorists going past the two roundabouts reach Haile Selassie roundabout and are stopped,” says Njuguna. In addition, traffic flowing from Lang’ata Road merges with those at Mombasa Road and piles to a halt at Haile Selassie, creating a gridlock all the way back to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.There were snarl-ups running over 15 kilometres on Mombasa Road. However, analysts say these are teething problems and that the long term solution will eventually ease congestion.To resolve the current problem, Njuguna says Kenha dispatched a team of researchers to study the traffic bottle-necks on Mombasa Road — especially Nyayo Stadium and Bunyala — and implement new measures that include extended control by traffic police. “We asked police at Haile Selassie to allow longer times for vehicles coming into the city through Uhuru Highway. On Friday the scenes were much better,” he said.While the process of implementing the new patterns fall along trial and error, Kenha and the county government are pleased with how the new patterns have evolved and are calling for patience.
The Peoples Democratic Party appears to be leading in the governorship election in Ebonyi State, going by the result obtained in some of the polling units in Abakaliki metropolis in Ebonyi Local Government Area.Although, feelers from the rural areas indicated that the Labour Party was leading in there, especially in Ebonyi North and Central senatorial zones.“The PDP is purely leading in Ebonyi South senatorial zone from the results we have gathered so far. But the Labour Party is purely having it well in the rural areas in Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central zones, which are the strong areas of the Labour Party candidate and his supporters gunning for seats in the House of Assembly,” a polling agent said.At polling unit 001 in Station Urban Primary School, the All Progressives Congress polled 19 votes; the LP garnered 43 votes, while the PDP had 171 votes.At polling unit 002, also in Station Urban Primary School, the PDP gathered 178 votes against 51 votes of the LP.The PDP got 190 votes at the Stadium Cover polling unit, while the LP and APC obtained 59 and 29 votes respectively.The PDP also led at Enugwu Ukwu Hall polling units 004 and 005, under Kpirikpiri ward. It got 26 votes, the LP got 19 votes and the APC got five votes.Due to the heavy rain that lasted in most parts of the state for several hours on Saturday, results in the polling units where Governor Martin Elechi voted in Ikwo council could not be obtained.It was the same situation in Umuebe in Ohaukwu council where the former governor of the state, Dr. Sam Egwu, voted.The polling officers in Ohaozara where the PDP governorship candidate, Dave Umahi voted refused to declare the results. According to voters who stayed behind, their refusal stemmed from the fact that the LP had won in most of the polling units.“They (PDP) never believed that the Labour Party could pull the weight here (Ohaozara) and this has led to the crisis in the area,” a voter said.However, at the polling unit in Eke Market Square, which is located in Ohaozara council, the PDP polled 83 votes against 39 of the LP. In another polling unit at Eke Market Square, the PDP garnered 80 votes against 40 from the LP.
The congregation raised their hands in worship as soloist Brian McClain sang gospel inside the church hall at the Word Ministries Christian Center, Summerville.“Don’t give up,” he sang. “You’ve got to be strong, stand your ground.” The crowd rose to its feet. The choir swayed in time. Images of 50-year-old Walter Scott, some from his time in the Coast Guard, others with his children and his parents, played on rotation on a large screen behind the altar. The stage was decorated with flowers, some shaped into a blue star, the emblem of Scott’s beloved football team, the Dallas Cowboys.Scott’s casket was draped in the stars and stripes. Members of his family sat close by.The small church, where the Scott family are regular worshippers, was full to capacity. Around 200 people sat inside, as around 100 others who could not get in stood outside in the rain. Those assembled were almost entirely African American.Scott was shot dead by a white North Charleston police officer, Michael Slager, last Saturday. The case initially failed to engage national media attention, with Slager maintaining that he had killed Scott because he feared for his own safety after Scott had attempted to take his Taser.But on Tuesday eyewitness video emerged, filmed on a phone and telling an entirely different tale. The footage showed Scott running away from Slager, who fired eight times, striking the unarmed Scott four times in the back.Outside the Word ministries, television cameras from national news networks lined the lawns.Inside, pastor George Hamilton delivered a sermon describing the presence of an eyewitness to the shooting as an act of God. He advised all those in the congregation to “keep your phone handy, keep your charge up; you never know when you’re going to need to be around”.Hamilton defended the North Charleston police department as an institution, but he said what the video revealed was a killing born of racial prejudice.“There is no doubt in my mind that Walter’s death was motivated by racism,” he said. “You have to hate somebody to shoot them from behind. This hate could not have been because of the person who Walter was. This hate was because Walter was an African American.”The funeral saw a relatively high police presence – for the purpose of traffic control, officers said. One Summerville police officer stood by the entrance to the church, seemingly assisting organisers with crowd control.Scott’s obituary, published in the order of service, described him as a man who “loved the Lord”.“He expressed it by singing in the choir,” it read. “He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.”Following the funeral, the South Carolina Democratic congressman Jim Clyburn told reporters Scott’s case should become a “catalyst” for change in law enforcement agencies around the US.“I think this is a catalyst to get people to face up to the fact that we’ve got problems in this country,” Clyburn said. “I think this exposed something that is already there.”Attorneys for the Scott family also addressed reporters. They confirmed, as has previously been reported, that Scott owed child support payments and that a bench warrant had been issued in his name. One of the attorneys, Chris Stewart, said it was the family’s belief that Scott had fled from his car after being pulled over by Slager for a routine traffic violation out of fear of going to jail over the arrears.On Saturday, local newspaper the Post and Courier published quotes from Scott taken from a 2013 interview in which he described being thrown in jail for 15 days 15 years ago, for a failure to pay child support. As a result, Scott lost his job at a film company.“I got mad at everybody in the whole world because I just lost the best job I ever had,” he told the Post and Courier. “I just stopped doing everything. I just closed myself into a little shell and started doing things I shouldn’t have been doing.”As the funeral on Saturday came to a close, the mourners walked in single file and slow procession to view Scott’s body. A soloist sang “I’m going up to yonder to be with my Lord” on a loop. It seemed to last for more than 20 minutes, as people came to pay their final respects.
Police have released dramatic footage of a high speed crash south of Brisbane late Saturday night, in which a car hit a pole, flipped then burst into flames.A 19-year-old man suffered a broken neck in the smash, which occurred after police attempted to stop a car in Yatala about 11.15pm.Police initially tried to intercept the Holden Commodore when they spotted it being driven erratically on Stanmore Road.Officers followed the car into a small residential street, where it then evaded both a police car and an officer who stood on the roadway in a bid to stop the driver.The police helicopter tracked the Commodore as it sped along Stanmore Road, where it ran a red light and narrowly avoided a collision with another car.Polair then continued to film as the car crashed into a pole at high speed, flipped onto its roof and caught fire.It then captured officers and passing motorists working to extricate the occupants from the wreckage.The 19-year-old passenger was the most seriously injured of the car's three occupants.The alleged driver, a man aged 20, and a 17-year-old female passenger suffered shock and bruising.All three were taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Etisalat Nigeria has recruited a second group of 18 students from Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria for the Etisalat Telecommunications Engineering Programme (ETEP) internship at the company.Launched in 2013, the ETEP is the first MSc Telecommunications Engineering programme in West Africa. The 18 students are the second set of intakes in the programme and they are expected to commence their four weeks internship on the April 20, 2015.Vice president, regulatory/corporate affairs at Etisalat Nigeria, Ibrahim Dikko, disclosed that the goal of the internship is to further broaden the students’ practical understanding of telecommunications engineering as well as part of the long term plan of creating a critical mass of highly skilled telecommunications specialists in Nigeria.During the internship, the students will have full access to insights that have made Etisalat the most reliable network in Nigeria.“At Etisalat, we believe that the right education has the potential to impact every aspect of life, so education remains central to our CSR interventions. With this four-week internship, we want to build local manpower with regards to telecommunications technology skills”, Dikko said.The first set of intakes to ETEP at ABU concluded their programme in 2014 and the three best graduating students of the postgraduate programme were sponsored to Etisalat Academy, Dubai for training.
Homicide detectives are investigating the suspicious disappearance of a Townsville woman who has been missing for more than a month.Julie Hutchinson, 48, was last seen at a home on Chelsea Drive in the Townsville suburb of Condon on March 7.She was reported missing on Thursday.A 47-year-old man, known to Ms Hutchinson, is helping police with their inquiries.Detective Inspector David Nixon will update media about the suspicious disappearance at 2pm on Sunday in Townsville.
AUGUSTA, Georgia - The biggest names in golf put major pressure on Jordan Spieth but the young American refused to crack, carding a two-under 70 on Saturday to take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters.Masters champions Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson and world number one Rory McIlroy all took turns trying to rattle the 21-year-old Texan, but Spieth held steady on a sweaty Georgia afternoon, setting a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under 200 to better the previous mark of 201 shared by Woods and Raymond Floyd.Runnerup to Bubba Watson last year in his Masters debut, Spieth will again feature in Sunday's final pairing where he will be joined by Englishman Justin Rose, who emerged as a green jacket contender with a blazing back nine.The 2013 U.S. Open winner, 10 shots back of the leader on the front nine, collected five birdies over his final six holes for a five-under 67.Phil Mickelson also had a 67 to sit five off the pace while Charley Hoffman returned a one-under 71 to leave him six back.McIlroy and Woods were among those at six under after shooting 68s.The third round of the Masters is often filled with drama but with Woods, the 14-time major winner; Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion; and McIlroy, chasing a career grand slam, all on the charge the atmosphere around Augusta National was electric with possibilities as Spieth's composure was put to the test.Holding a five-shot overnight lead, the unflappable Spieth had threatened to run away with the year's first major, widening his lead to seven before a double-bogey at the par-four 17th.After carding just a single bogey through the opening two rounds, Spieth had three on Saturday along with his double-bogey, but also compiled seven birdies."I knew that something under par would be a good round," Spieth told reporters. "The greens kind of baked up and got quick and slippery."Obviously being four-under at one point in the round and closing it out at two-under is disappointing."Obviously would have liked to have finished the round a little bit better but also could have been worse."They are going to bring their game and I've got to have a relatively stress-free round going; and when I say that, I mean give myself some tap in pars and not have to make so many putts."Competing for the first time in two months after a self-imposed absence from the PGA Tour to retool his game, Woods flashed glimpses of the form that carried him to four green jackets as he joined McIlroy, Kevin Streelman (70), Kevin Na (70) and Dustin Johnson (73) in a tie for fifth, 10 shots back of the frontrunner."I've got to go out early and do what I did a few years ago, I shot 30 or 31," said Woods refusing to wave the white flag on a fifth Masters title. "I'm going to have to do something like that and continue on the back nine, at least give myself a chance going in the back nine."It's in Jordan's hands right now, he can run off and make three birdies coming in and put a substantial gap between himself and the rest of the field."But you just never know."McIlroy made a spectacular start with an eagle on the par-five second.On the brink of missing the cut with nine holes to play on Friday, the Northern Irishman grinded his way to eight under but stumbled with bogeys at the 16th and 18th."A disappointing finish," lamented McIlroy. "But overall felt like I played pretty well; and as I say, just a little disappointed the way I finished."
The hallowed halls of century-old Central Tech have many stories — such as the nude woman Leo Darmitz encountered on his first day of school.“There are a lot of great stories to be told,” said Darmitz, who graduated in 1960 and is the alumni organizer for Central Technical High School’s 100th anniversary celebrations.In 1955, Darmitz showed up for his first day of school but wasn’t pre-rgistered and found many courses at the school were filled.He and a group of other students who hadn’t registered were put into a group with no set time table.“At the completion of class, we asked where we were to go next. They just looked for vacant or lightly filled classes and sent us there,” Darmitz said.For third period of the first day, he and his classmates were sent to join an art class with senior students in a large studio with chalk dust covering the floors.There were no desks in the studio, only chairs which the older students propped upside down to mount their drawing pads.The teacher was not impressed the younger students didn’t know the drill, Darmitz recalled.His group of students were instructed to gather supplies and prepare for class.“Without any further introduction as to what to do, the teacher turned to leave. As he was doing so he said, ‘You know the exercise, get to it,” Darmitz said.“There was a moment of silence as the teacher left the room. Then the drapery that shrouded the small platform in the corner parted and out stepped a female model, completely nude.”Alumni at Central Tech gearing up for its 100th anniversary are working on publishing a 120-page book to celebrate a century of achievements and memories.There may not be an illustration of the nude art model.Central Tech has a long list of famous alumni that includes Ed Mirvish of Honest Ed’s and a patron of the arts, Johnny Lombardi of CHIN Radio and A pioneer of multicultural radio broadcasting in Canada, George Chuvalo the five-time Canadian heavyweight boxing champion and CFL linebacker Tristan Black who played with the Toronto Argonauts as a member of the 100th Grey Cup winning team.There is a long tradition of students at Central Tech excelling, said principal Lisa Edwards.“At CTS teachers, coaches and mentors look to find what a student is passionate about and develop it. This is just part of what makes students that graduate from Central Technical School so successful,” Edwards said.The alumni celebration weekend is being planned for Oct. 16 t0 18.To become involved, make a donation or purchase space in the book of memories, call Darmitz at 905-891-2748.
Those of us that are willing to follow after the order of this high Priesthood Jesus, we are also going to stand and say “Lord, here am I and with my whole body” Jesus said, “For me, I am come to do Thy will, Oh God.” Will you make such a choice? Will you come to that level of decision where you are saying, “Lord, I am come to do Thy will O, God”. In this church where you gave me an opportunity and a body to serve you with, it is your will I came to do. And I am ready to die doing it. I am not here to compete for popularity, I am not here to compete for strength, I am not here to compete for power, neither am I here to compete for people’s pockets. “I am come to do Thy will 0h God as it is written concerning me.” That will is to offer your body as a living sacrifice. That is what Jesus regarded as the will of God. The will of God for Jesus is not activities; it is the surrender of His body for God to work in.Your Whole Body… Rather than Sacrifices.This is another serious aberration God must deliver us from. Many of us keep our bodies intact for our ‘self-purposes’, while we look for some other things to give to God. Some of us give God gifts, money, etc while withholding our bodies for sins or personal ambitions and careers. We need to offer to God this whole body- mind, intellect, feelings, and all, for His activity to be done inside. God needs to sit inside this body and do His work.“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God; that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service”. (Romans 12: 1).Some brothers with good voices are presenting their voices. They seem to feel that God needs their voices, while the rest of their body is theirs – theirs to fornicate with, to live arrogantly with. So, we have so many good singers singing for Jesus in the church but their bodies are most undisciplined. They are in the choir. They seemed to have lent God their talents. They are playing the guitar or the organ and occasionally they draw attention to themselves using the instruments. They believe that there is nobody else that God can use. God is not asking you to present your voice. What does He want? It is when God takes possession of a man that his life becomes useful. When you are going to present your body, it means the man, the former occupant, with his personal programmes, desires, and taste, is no longer there. You must become a novice because the man that was using that body has passed away. It has to be Jesus who is going to now sit inside the body using the hand, the mouth, and the voice.That is why in God’s kingdom, it is not necessarily true, that because you were a music specialist in the world, that you can automatically become a music minister in the church. We see such people just after two months of repentance, already starting a music ministry for God. If things are to be done correctly, such persons ought to be sent to go and sit down yet. They will unlearn all the music they learnt, and then learn to humbly ask: “Jesus how do I play guitar for you?” Jesus could then decide that He did not save them to play the guitar. What actually their bodies are needed for is to sweep the church, since there are people who are already playing the guitar.There could be certain things that you know how to do before for the ‘flesh’, yet if you want to become useful to God, even those things will first be removed from your hands. This is because you used to do those things with your bodies for the old man. God will remove them from you first so that the old man can die and you can find your course in life. God is asking you to present to Him your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. The Bible calls that your reasonable service. It is your ministry. Brethren, ministry is not preaching, singing nor teaching per se. Preaching, singing, and teaching, are all secondary assignments. Our ministry, our reasonable service, is being available for God to work in us. What you now see God doing in me is not my work. This is where the confusion is. Jesus never forgot that. He kept saying it.Pray that your eyes of understanding be opened!
It's fast and explosive and it's back. International boxing makes a welcome return to the Western Bay of Plenty in round two of the Clash of the Corporates.Anthony TNT Taylor will headline this month's Clash of the Corporates. Photo: Facebook.Following on from last October's success, the next big fight night is set down for April 18.Headlining a dozen corporate fights, is an International Professional Light Welterweight bout between Western Bay's Anthony TNT Taylor and an extremely experienced Thai opponent.The international contest, will be the main attraction fought over eight two-minute rounds in what should be an explosive contest at the QE2 Youth Centre's Memorial Hall.Taylor who fashioned an impressive nine win, one draw and one loss in the pay to punch ranks, has raw power in both fists, which should keep the expected sell-out crowd on its feet.At the last Clash of the Corporates, Taylor was in dynamic form stopping Taranaki's Daniel Maxwell in the sixth round of their New Zealand Welterweight title fight.The New Zealand professional title follows a decorated Amateur career, where the Tauranga puncher won two Boxing New Zealand Light Welterweight crowns.The highlight of Taylor's time in the amateur ranks, was to earn selection for the New Zealand Commonwealth Games team that took part in the 2010 Commonwealth event in India.However, the Western Bay pugilist won't be taking the challenge in the ring from Kru Chain lightly come April 18.The Thai pro boxer is a Muay Thai kickboxing veteran, who has had a multitude of visits to the kick boxing ring in recent years and has a reputation as a genuine hard nut in Thai kick boxing.While patrons at the event will get to watch plenty of action in the lead-up corporate fights – Anthony TNT Taylor won't want to leave the decision in the hands of the judges against Kru Chain and is likely to chase victory by the short route.
A display of community solidarity and support could not be stronger with dozens of volunteers rolling over 14,000 cheese rolls to support an Alexandra family.The Becks Hall, in Central Otago, was bustling with activity on Sunday - music blaring, pots stirred, cheese mixture poured, bread rolled and crates stacked.Ashlee Sutherland, of Becks, organised the fundraiser to raise money for Ashleigh and Peter Brown, whose 10-week old son Riley is battling the rare congenital disorder Zellweger spectrum.  Babies who suffer from the disorder - for which there is no treatment or cure - typically do not live past their first year.  Some community fundraising had helped the Brown family make mortgage payments and pay bills during weeks of hospital treatments, but the family was struggling.  READ MORE: Baby battles rare congenital disorder, Zellweger spectrumSutherland said she was delighted with the number of people who had turned out to help and they were getting into a rhythm pumping out 20 dozen cheese rolls every 11 minutes.The community had rallied behind the fundraiser and cheese rolls had sold fast, she said."Everyone has been fantastic. We just sold more and more really."Volunteer Chontelle Saunders, of Alexandra, said making the cheese rolls was easy once they got into a routine."They are great friends and they would do it for us."
It may no longer be “America’s game” at the turnstiles or in the ratings, but baseball has always ruled on the big-screen. Hundreds of baseball movies have been made, and they number among the best sports movies ever.Maybe there’s something inherently relatable about baseball players. They don’t have to be seven-feet tall or 300-plus pounds. You wouldn’t find a physique like David Wells or Prince Fielder in any other sport, except maybe golf… or bowling.And the almost cosmic intangibility of the sport – dependent as it is on “breaks” – lends itself to bigger thoughts about life. Or maybe to a stray fastball in the groin. Whatever.On the occasion of the upcoming Blue Jays home opener, here’s an entirely subjective list of best, worsts and random observations about assorted baseball movies.Kevin Costner. He starred in arguably the best sports movie of all time, 1988’s Bull Durham and cemented his rep as the “baseball guy” the next year with Field of Dreams. He returned to the diamond in 1999 in Sam Raimi’s For the Love of the Game playing a pitcher whose last start, a nothing game against the Yankees, turns into one for the ages (punctuated by flashbacks). By accounts, Costner was a pretty good high school pitcher, too.Charlie Sheen in Major League (1989). As Ricky “Wild Thing” Vaughn, he took to the field like a gladiator with The Troggs’ biggest hit as a theme song, leaving everyone within 30 feet of the plate trembling in fear of something “just a little outside.” He’s everybody's favourite Wild Thing, except in Toronto, where Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams gave up the Series-winning homer to Joe Carter.Anthony Perkins as Jimmy Piersall in 1957’S Fear Strikes Out. Excellent movie. Should have hired a stunt double though. Runners up: John Goodman as Babe Ruth in The Babe (1992) and – I’m gonna say it – Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees (1942).Brendan Fraser in The Scout. Widely considered one of the worst baseball movies ever. Released, appropriately enough, during the 1994 strike season.Animals playing baseball. We’re speaking specifically of Bud the golden retriever in Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch (2002) and Ed, the chimp in 1996’s Ed (for identification purposes, Ed’s co-star Matt Leblanc was the one who spoke words).From Moneyball. “An ugly girlfriend means no confidence, OK? I’m just saying, we are trying to replace Giambi and this guy’s girlfriend is a six at best.”A KID SAID THAT IN A FAMILY COMEDY? MAN, THE ‘70s WERE A DIFFERENT TIME:“All we got on this team are a buncha Jews, s---, n----, pansies, and a booger-eatin' moron!” Jackie Earle Haley as Tanner Boyle in The Bad News Bears (1976).Tommy Lee Jones as Ty Cobb in Cobb (1994). As miserable an interviewee as Jones is, there may be ex-sportswriters still alive who can confirm that the Georgia Peach was a sumbitch on a whole other level.To Fever Pitch (2005), in which Jimmy Fallon learns to give up all hope of the Red Sox winning a Series and give in to loving Drew Barrymore. Except that the Curse of the Bambino was finally broken after principle filming ended and they had to frantically reshoot the ending.STILL SOLID ADVICE – I’M LOOKING AT YOU, JETER:“There’s no crying in baseball!” Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own (1992).WHAT PART OF ‘THERE’S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL’ DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?:Bang The Drum Slowly (1973), with Michael Moriarty and Robert De Niro as best-friend battery mates. Next to Brian’s Song, the #2 movie guys can’t watch without getting something in their eye.Robert Redford as 35-year-old rookie Roy Hobbs in The Natural (1984). Dennis Quaid as real-life 35-year-old rookie Jim Morris in The Rookie (2002).Making the baseball-obsessed J.D. Salinger-esque author in the book Shoeless Joe into a black character (James Earl Jones) in Field of Dreams. You guys do know that was Jim Crow baseball, right?MOST UNDERRATED BASEBALL MOVIE (OR WHAT’S A SCANDAL WITHOUT CHARLIE SHEEN?):Eight Men Out (1988), John Sayles’ movie about the Black Sox scandal, featured Sheen as Happy Felsch, John Cusack as Buck Weaver, a young Michael Rooker (The Walking Dead) as Chick Gandil and D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe Jackson. Cool flick.Robert De Niro is the title character in 1996’s The Fan (a knife salesman no less) who stalks newly-acquired San Francisco Giant Wesley Snipes. Yikes.YOU NEVER SAW IT, AND THEY NEVER WENT ANYWHERE:Million Dollar Arm (2014), the true story of a sports agent (Jon Hamm) who signed two Indian cricket players to minor league baseball contracts.
Three indigenous languages still spoken in Canada are among a group being studied as researchers attempt to understand how children around the world learn their vastly different mother tongues.The global project — spearheaded by the University of Zurich — is looking at Dene, East Cree, and Inuktitut among 10 languages.Researchers already know that children have little problem learning to speak their native language. What's not well understood is exactly how this happens."We're trying to get a real sense of how children can acquire or learn any language in the world," Dagmar Jung, a senior researcher from the University of Zurich, said in an interview."It's a miracle that any child can actually learn any language it's exposed to when it's young."As part of the study, Jung and Olga Lovick, an associate linguistics professor at the First Nations University of Canada, were heading to the Clearwater River Dene Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday.It's one of only three places in the world where children grow up speaking Dene.About 7,000 languages are spoken around the world but most research to date has focused on the structurally similar large European languages."The question is how do kids go about learning a language that is structurally so different as Dene?" Jung said from Regina.Jung, who plans an initial two-month stay with the Clearwater River Dene, and Lovick plan to train community members to record children of two or three years old and to write down what they say over the next year.Lovick will help co-ordinate the research, which will involve Dene language experts, research and recording assistants, as well as participating families.At one point, Canada was home to more than 70 distinct First Nations languages. Recent figures suggest about a dozen have disappeared altogether and the others — with few exceptions — are extremely endangered."By our being there and fostering this interest in children learning the language, we're hoping that maybe this will remind people how important it is to speak Dene to their kids so that they keep learning Dene," Lovick said. "In many other places it's too late."One aim of the research is to identify ways to teach First Nations languages more effectively to adults."We know how hard they are to learn as adults," Jung said. "So everybody is actually really excited to see finally how children do it because we just don't know how to do it easily."One idea — currently being challenged — is that children's brains have a "hard-wired" grammar module called Universal Grammar from which all human languages can be derived.Another idea is that learning a language relies on general cognitive mechanisms.Much of the initial research on Inuktitut and East Cree is already underway or been done.The other languages in the study are Turkish, Japanese, Russian, Sesotho, which is spoken in southern Africa, Yucatec Maya in Mexico, Chintang in Nepal, and Indonesian.
Taraji P. Henson knows it’s not her roles in The Karate Kid remake or Think Like A Man Too that brought her to the Saturday Night Live stage. She’s there because of the instant breakout of primetime soap opera, Empire and a certain loud and proud character named Cookie Lyons, a woman who hasn’t met a scene she couldn’t steal.But, it turns out Cookie couldn’t stay the whole night (she only appeared in one digital short) so her alter ego Henson was upstaged by Kate McKinnon in almost every single sketch.This is how the cookie crumbled.Hillary Clinton (Kate McKinnon) attempts to come off as warm and friendly while recording a video message declaring her candidacy for president. Instead, she has trouble unfreezing her face from a terrifying grin and shouts “Citizens! You will elect me as your leader!” The best part of this sketch was when former SNL star (and current announcer) Darrell Hammond walked in the shot to reprise his classic Bill Clinton impersonation. The real Bill and Hillary back on the campaign trail and Hammond back as the skirt-chasing ex-president. Everything old is new again – and it’s kind of cool.Henson waits until her second sentence before mentioning Cookie, so that shows some restraint. From there, the rest of the monologue is a souped-up, over-the-top show-stopper with Henson singing about how she’s “made it,” backed up with a full gospel choir. Yes, Taraji, you’ve made it. But you’re also a little pitchy. Nothing those Empire producers can’t fix with some Auto-Tune.McKinnon takes the lead again – this time as a loopy Liza Minnelli-type designer hawking a line of red, sparkly ponchos on shopping channel QVC. She claims the over-sized smocks can be worn three different ways – just don’t ask her what they are. After using a model (Aidy Bryant) to demonstrate that the poncho can be worn normally (that’s the first look) or stretched to the side to expose one shoulder (that’s the second) – she zones out and spends the rest of the segment cluelessly talking to unsatisfied customers on speakerphone while the host (Henson) tries to jog her memory.In a rip-off of A League of Their Own, the all-female and all-white baseball team balks at the thought of letting a black female (Henson) join the lineup. When Leslie Jones’ character (also black but bigger and taller with braided hair) inquires about joining, she’s met with looks of terror. Whoa. That’s a lot of race commentary crammed into such a short sketch, and that line about sending Jones’ character “overseas to kill some Krauts” was just mean. It got exactly zero laughs, too. Which is exactly the right amount.Henson comes to Sesame Street as her Empire character Cookie to tell off Ernie, intimidate Mr. Snuffleupagus and Big Bird, take cookies from Cookie Monster and…um…turn Elmo into a red fur coat. The Muppets were good sports about this one.With the release of their new album Wilder Mind, British band Mumford & Sons shows off their more guitar-heavy sound playing The Wolf as their first song, which is a burst of energy from start to finish and really gives their drummer a workout. They choose the slow-build Believe the second time out.
THE Corrs are mourning the death of their father who passed away after suffering a heart attack.It’s understood Gerry Corr, who lived in their native Dundalk, Co Louth, had a heart attack last Sunday and was taken to the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin before passing away on Thursday.His friend Fr Michael Cusack described Mr Corr, who was in his early seventies, as a man of “great faith” who was adored by his children.“I’m very sad to hear of his loss and so will his children be, they all adored him.“He was a very kind and decent man,” he said.Mr Corr’s wife Jean passed away in 1999 aged 57 from a lung condition.His removal will take place on Monday at 11.30am to The Church Of The Holy Redeemer in Dundalk for funeral mass followed by burial at St Patrick’s cemetery.
Holocaust survivor Heinrich Rotmensch returns to the concentration camp were 70 years ago he escaped from hours before he was due to die.Survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp near the eastern German city of Weimar gathered on Saturday to commemorate the camp's liberation by American soldiers on 11 April, 1945.Among them was Rotmensch, who spent more than seven years in various concentration camps until the end of World War II.“I grew up in concentration camps and spent time in eight of them,” he said.“I was transferred from the Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp in Poland to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. And then I was transferred to a small town in Tuttlingen.”A local German, Rotmensch studied, played, lived and grew up just like any other German children until his family’s Jewish identity was revealed.Taken by the Nazi SS when he was just 15-years-old, Rotmensch never saw his parents again.Years later, he learned that his mother died in the gas chambers of the Auschwitz, while his father was shot dead by the Nazis army. His body was never found.His elder brother survived at the camp, but died later died in war in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.Read More: Survivors recall Buchenwald horrorsRotmensch and many others were rescued by the French Army after it marched into Germany."The French controlled the whole train as we were being sent to the execution site. Fortunately, we ran into the French Army and got saved," he said.Praying for his parents and brothers in Hebrew in front of the Monument to the Jewish Victims at the Buchenwald concentration camp, Rotmensch said that Germany had done well reflecting its Nazi history.
A motion for a disaffiliation vote will be submitted Tuesday during a special general assembly.In an interview with le Soleil, the CEGEP student association’s spokesperson Antoine Godin-Landry said that 200 students have signed a petition circulating since March seeking to disaffiliate.Last week, students at Cégep Garneau voted nearly 70 per cent against a strike day to allow its members to attend a protest in Montreal.Following the resignation — and subsequent symbolic firing — of ASSÉ’s executive last weekend, the group reiterated the necessity of continuing their fight against austerity measures, fossil fuels and “political repression.”ASSÉ’s executive was removed after distributing a text proposing a strategic break from striking to better coordinate with labour unions in the fall.
North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda West Indies and England face off in the first Test of a three-match series at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Monday, with both sides involved in reconstruction and rehabilitation following a wretched few months.Facing the wrath of the Indian authorities following an unprecedented abandonment of the tour there last October and with several of their star players either overlooked by the selectors or unwilling to represent the regional team, there is considerable trepidation over the prospects of the West Indies in the opening fixture, notwithstanding the ground's reputation as a batting paradise.Chris Gayle, who led the West Indies to an upset 1-0 triumph the last time England played a Test series in the Caribbean in 2009, announced his unavailability for the assignment, although he is turning out for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League.Dwayne Bravo, captain of the squad who walked out of the Indian campaign, appears to be paying the price for his role in that fiasco, although the official line from the selectors, headed by outstanding former captain Clive Lloyd, is that they are looking to younger players to try to take the team forward.While the West Indies were at least able to qualify from their preliminary group at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand last month, England failed to advance beyond the group stage, inviting widespread condemnation at home and at the same time fuelling speculation over the possible return of controversial batsman Kevin Pietersen for the Ashes series against arch-rivals Australia in three months' time.One batsman who is expected to make a return in Antigua is Jonathan Trott.Seemingly lost to the game when leaving the last Ashes series in Australia after struggling to cope with the pace of Mitchell Johnson in the first Test in Brisbane, the 33-year-old South African-born player looks set to open the batting in his 50th Test with captain Alastair Cook.Without a century for his country in more than a year-and-a-half, Cook is likely to attract almost forensic attention, both for his leadership and form with the bat, as England embark on an arduous campaign of 17 Tests over a nine-month period.Rustiness will also be a concern as their last Test was more than eight months ago when they completed a 3-1 home series demolition of a dispirited Indian side.Their brief build-up to this series was hardly taxing as the couple of two-day matches against a St Kitts Invitational XI provided such a low standard of opposition that the tourists resorted to using some of their squad players in the home team for the second match.However the game unfolds, England and their army of travelling supporters are anticipating at least one moment of celebration as experienced seam and swing bowler James Anderson needs four wickets in his 100th Test to surpass celebrated all-rounder Ian Botham's tally of 383 – the most by an England cricketer in Tests.Ironically, Anderson and the rest of the England pace attack are being mentored on this tour by fast bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who was surprisingly removed as head coach of the West Indies just a couple of days before the home series against Bangladesh last August.Former hard-hitting West Indies opener Phil Simmons, previously in charge of Ireland, was only announced two weeks ago as Gibson's full-time replacement.Simmons has been preparing the squad at a training camp in Antigua where the continuing good form of Devendra Bishoo looks certain to result in the return of the leg-spinner to the Test fold three years after his last match against Australia in Barbados.Home captain Denesh Ramdin has spoken of relying on spinners to win the series for him, raising the prospect of a final XI including both Bishoo and left-armer Sulieman Benn.That would leave Kemar Roach and Jerome Taylor, the destroyer of England in the decisive first Test in Jamaica in 2009, as the twin spearheads of a bowling attack that will be seeking to exploit and magnify any self-doubt among opponents who inevitably have one eye on their impending home duel with the Australians.
We are far from being done, even though it feels like we are. It is a huge relief and a boost to our morale and sense of accomplishment that the…
Lagos Mainland Rep-elect Jide Jimoh on Sunday blamed poor political education by INEC for the low turnout of voters in Saturday’s Governorship/House of Assembly elections.Jimoh told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that INEC’s inadequate time for electioneering also contributed to the voter apathy recorded in the poll.“It takes two to tango, the electoral officers must also embark on proper enlightenment, political parties must also intensify their enlightenment and campaign.“Voting is voluntary, you cannot coerce people to go out and vote; someone may have his permanent voter card and decide to keep it at home,’’ he said.The elected legislator added that: “For the fact that people have not come out to vote is not a crime, we just have to encourage people.’’He also stressed the need for government to improve much more on the provision of infrastructure and empowerment so that dividends of democracy will ginger and encourage people to vote.The rep-elect noted that the period of campaign should not be too close, saying that the period for campaign in this country is too short.“In U.S., you have up to three months for campaign before elections; in Nigeria, it is a few weeks you have left to campaign.’’He called for the review of the relevant laws, saying that the number of months for campaign should be increased for future elections.Jimoh, however, commended INEC for improving on its performance in the March 28 elections, noting the conduct of the governorship and state Houses of Assembly election was much better.“I tell you that there are some improvements which I observed in the conduct of this election, compared with the fortnight’s exercise.“For instance, the INEC personnel have improved much more on the use and workings of smart card readers,’’ he said.On the use of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and card readers, Jimoh said it was a welcome development for this country.He urged the electoral commission to retain the use of the card readers in future elections and improve on them.“It has reduced drastically the number of fraudulent activities where in those days you see a local government bring outrageous votes.“The system ensures that voters must be seen and identified physically which made manipulation of figures difficult.’’The rep- elect, who attributed his success to God’s work and the love by the people, urged Nigerians to live up to their responsibilities in the governance of the country.

BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is The Vaccines singer Justin Young.Young is a Manchester United fan whose favourite player, David Beckham, influenced him in more ways than one."David Beckham was a great 'hair-spiration' for me as a boy, and an inspiration on and off the field too," he told BBC Sport."Eric Cantona and Peter Schmeichel were my other favourite players but Beckham was my number one."Without a doubt my favourite Beckham haircut was the Brylcreem-era curtains and I still haven't stopped trying to emulate them."A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, with one perfect score.His score of seven points was beaten by darts legend Phil 'The Power' Taylor, who also picked five correct results, but with two perfect scores. That gave the 16-time world champion a total of nine points.Lawro also made a prediction for Aston Villa's rearranged game with QPR on Wednesday. He went for a 2-0 Villa win but did not pick up any extra points because the game finished 3-3.We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.Manchester United are on a very good run and their fans are suddenly all shouting about how they are going to finish above Manchester City.On current form, it looks like they might be right because United have been playing very well in recent weeks. City, clearly, have not.The biggest problem for the defending champions is that they have been too easy to play against and, therefore, too easy to beat.But this is a huge game for them and I think we will see City's big players like Yaya Toure rise to the occasion. They have done that enough times at Old Trafford in the recent past - City have won on their last three visits.I am expecting a closer encounter this time and I think it is going to end in a draw after an open game.Justin's prediction: David De Gea is perhaps the best keeper in the world on his day. He's one of the main reasons we are where we are. I'm a massive Wayne Rooney fan and I've really enjoyed seeing Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini come good under Louis van Gaal, because I wasn't their biggest fan before.I think next year will be an important year for us, this season we just need to get in the top four and I think United will win. 4-0Liverpool got themselves over the line and to Wembley after beating Blackburn in their FA Cup quarter-final tie and that success will help their league form too.I can only see one outcome at Anfield on Monday, because Newcastle's poor form means they are the team everyone wants to play right now.Fourth place has gone for Liverpool but their aim now has to be to finish in fifth, get to the FA Cup final and try to win it.Do that, and they have had a good season.* Does not include scores for postponed game - Leicester v Chelsea
Tuen Mun Town Plaza recently caught the eyes of many as radical protesters against parallel trading clashed with mainland visitors and police in the biggest shopping mall in the northwestern New Territories.One popular way for local residents or shoppers from across the border to get to the mall is by taking the light railway to Pui To stop.Many may not know that Pui To is not just the name of a nearby road. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, a Buddhist monk named Pui To came to Tuen Mun from India. He is believed to be the first monk to have brought Buddhism here.I'm no expert on Buddhism and this column is not going to focus on the history of this great religion. It's just that few people realise that Pui To is linked to tycoon Li Ka-shing's decision to finance the construction of the just completed Tsz Shan Monastery in Tai Po.While the media reported widely on the private bullet-proof safe house and meditation room for Li, visitors to the Tang dynasty-style temple, which opens to the public on Wednesday, will hopefully find tranquility of nature and soul rather than thinking about the various stories surrounding Li and his intentions in donating HK$1.5 billion for the project.Li initiated the idea more than 10 years ago because he felt there was too much negative sentiment in the city. In the epilogue of a book on the construction of the monastery, Li wrote: "There is a precious pearl deep in everyone's heart. As long as you can find it, your heart will be enlightened. The issue is 'have you found it'?"Walter Ngai Kai-shu, the monastery's secretary general, explained a new way to worship at the facility. Visitors, he said, would be asked to put a bowl of water into a giant vat rather than burning incense as in many other temples. It is said that what Hong Kong now needs is water to cool down the heat in our midst.This seems all very Buddhist, but like it or not, this city certainly needs more cool heads to forge greater tolerance and harmony, as political controversy, social inequality and intensifying Hong Kong-mainland tension take hold.Religion is not supposed to be a cure for everything, but calmness and peace of mind certainly help. Take tourism as an example. Hongkongers started complaining when too many mainland visitors arrived. But over the Easter holidays, when there were fewer mainlanders, the tourism sector bemoaned a loss of business.The question of how Hong Kong can sustain its attraction to mainland spenders while curbing parallel trading is a complicated issue which needs deep reflection not only by the tourism sector and the government, but also the community as a whole.When Pui To first came to Hong Kong more than 1,500 years ago, Tuen Mun was a remote area. He could not have imagined what Hong Kong would look like today and what frustrations and difficulties Hongkongers would face. But the Buddhist theory of karma - that there is a relationship of cause and effect in everything - remains inspiring. Hong Kong's tomorrow is in the hands of our actions today.

I recently visited a ‘head shop’, one of many totally legal establishments now flourishing on British high streets, where users of officially illegal drugs may buy the equipment they need to enjoy their criminal habit.I didn’t buy anything. But one of the items on sale was a wall-clock, especially designed to be used to store drugs. ‘Hide your stash in plain sight!’ said the little poster next to it.It is good advice. If you really want to conceal something, leave it lying about where everyone can see it.This is what the Prime Minister has done with his supposed promise to hold a referendum on British membership of the European Union.The dishonest trick at the heart of the offer is so blazingly obvious that nobody notices it.Let me explain. If Mr Cameron really believed that he would win a parliamentary majority on May 7, he would not make this promise.He loves the EU so much that he has said that he wants to extend it to the Ural mountains. He absolutely does not want this country to leave it.But because Mr Cameron knows perfectly well that he will not win such a majority, and that no possible coalition partner or ally would support such a referendum, he feels safe to make a pledge that will never be redeemed.The purpose of the pledge is to win back some of those voters he and his Blairite friends have long derided as fruitcakes and closet racists. He despises them, but he wants their support to ensure that the Tories are the largest party, and that he stays in office.It would be disastrous for him if they all took him too literally. He needs some of them, but not all of them.This is perhaps why the Tory Party’s campaign is so crude, narrow and awful, almost designed to repel thinking and decent people.The interesting thing about all this is that it is so blatant, yet nobody seems to notice it, just as they don’t notice the perilous state of our economy (another disastrous balance of payments deficit was announced last week).And just as it is obvious that, while we are supposed to have ‘tough’ and ‘draconian’ laws on drugs, shops which help people take drugs thrive all over the country. I sometimes wonder if, one dark and tear-stained morning, all these many lies will be brutally exposed in one dreadful awakening.Winning at any cost? It's the only Game in townWhen I rather guiltily read the books on which the TV series Game Of Thrones is based, I was struck by one thing. The whole point of this saga is that ruthlessness pays, that evil generally wins, that justice is non-existent, and utter cynicism the only wisdom. It is the Middle Ages without the saving grace of Christianity.The whole idea is symbolised by the ghastly Iron Throne for which the various factions and clans compete, and which, once gained, eats into the souls of all who sit on it.I won’t watch the TV version because I very much do not want to see a slick and well-acted portrayal of such foul behaviour. But the success of this drama suggests that this sort of merciless immorality now has a wide and receptive audience. Gleeful, unembarrassed ruthlessness, once rightly kept in check, has become normal among us, and Game Of Thrones is a success because this change is now more or less complete.Political campaigning has played its part in this. I first noticed really dirty tricks in the 1997 campaign, when New Labour screened a particularly vile anti-Tory broadcast personally mocking Tory politicians and conference representatives, and falsely alleging a plan to ‘abolish the old age pension’.Once, this sort of thing was left to underlings and backstairs-crawlers who could be disowned. But now it seems to have become central. The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, is a senior Cabinet Minister and an experienced grey head in the Tory Party. I rather like him. But his outburst against Ed Miliband, accusing him of stabbing his brother in the back, and planning to do the same to the country, was a departure from the old rules of gentlemanly combat.It was also inaccurate, as Mr Miliband stabbed his brother in the front, openly campaigning against him in an election – more than can be said for the Tories, who deviously overthrew Iain Duncan Smith in a cruel and personalised putsch.But perhaps the most tricky and ruthless political act of the week came from the Blair creature, who ‘supported’ Mr Miliband on the European issue. How can this ghastly, discredited man not know that his kiss is the kiss of death? Of course he does.Compared with Blair’s embrace, a stab in the back would be an act of kindness.You shouldn't make it upThe story of how the young Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret mingled incognito with VE Night revellers is a moving and very British episode.So why must the makers of a new film, claiming to be about the event, fabricate falsehoods about the King’s daughters going to brothels and gambling dens, and Princess Margaret getting drunk?I suppose that having got away with the multiple untruths in The King’s Speech, the movie industry felt that invention was better box office than truth.And yes, I know Shakespeare made things up, too. But this stuff isn’t Shakespeare.The devastating attack no one heardIn a grown-up campaign, last week’s attack on David Cameron by a former British ambassador to Syria would have been devastating. As it is, it seems to have passed almost without notice.Here’s a flavour of the indictment levelled by Peter Ford, Our Man in Damascus from 2003 to 2006.‘If Cameron had his way, the jihadists could have been in control of Damascus by now,’ and, ‘To call for the overthrow of the secular Syrian government, to demonise it out of all proportion… to predict its imminent fall… and then to wail as though it was nothing to do with them when British Muslims set off to help hasten said overthrow is inconsistent and nonsensical.’I couldn’t agree more, and still can’t understand how he gets away with it.Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Cameron go around the country eating bacon sandwiches and hot dogs with knives and forks to avoid embarrassing photos.
The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose.Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days.Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah – a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher – has been charged with her murder.Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'.Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user – and that her whole family were addicted to the drug.But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts.He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.'The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction – but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years.He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.'And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.'He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him.And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana.Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS.Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally.On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days.But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked.On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery.Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information.Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.
A leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.Tom O’Carroll, a former Open University information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE, attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation.The organisation, set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, is campaigning against what it sees as the ‘biased and unfair’ Independent Press Standards Organisation.It wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry.The news that O’Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group.PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL).The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child 'understood the nature of the act' and apparently consented.The group also wanted incest to be legalised.O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee. The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ‘corrupting public morals’.He wrote a blog after the February meeting, chaired by comedian John Cleese, confirming his attendance.A Hacked Off spokesman said that the meeting was ‘open to and free for all members of the public to attend’.

A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday.Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source.The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place.Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family.Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine.One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts.His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search.At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis.He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff.The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body.Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way.Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him.'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started.'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis.'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.'He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old.'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell.'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.'Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family.'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon.'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it.'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.'Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk.The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages.David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014.On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'.Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad – they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named.They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.'Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.'An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before.'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'
The 52-year-old has replaced Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins as most likely to take on the role, according to bookies. Philip is best known for starring as the rough-and-ready DCI Gene Hunt, the politically-incorrect detective from the BBC police drama. Odds have been slashed from 10-1 to 2-1 after The Sun on Sunday reported that the BBC are considering hiring the actor-turned-presenter. The BBC declined to comment on the speculation.Philip is a vocal car enthusiast and is about to present the second series of For The Love Of Cars on Channel Four David Williams of Ladbrokes said: "All of a sudden Glenister is the hottest name around. "We hadn't seen a penny for him before the weekend but in next to no time he's the new favourite. Punters seem convinced that something is afoot." Simon Clare, spokesman for Coral, said they have slashed their bets from 10/1 to 2/1 for Glenister. "We have seen a host of celebrities gambled on in recent weeks to take over from Clarkson and it is rapidly becoming one of the biggest novelty betting events ever", he said.Behind Philip, Great British Bake Off star Sue Perkins is the next favourite at 4-1 followed by Dermot O'Leary who has recently quit X Factor at 5-1. Jeremy was the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him in a 30-second assault on March 4. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. Last week, the disgraced 55-year-old pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You. The future of the show's other two presenters – Richard Hammond and James May – is also unclear, with both men's Top Gear contracts having run out.
MOTORISTS heading to and from the city centre have been caught up in large traffic jams today as work continues on new road crossings at one of Hull's busiest junctions.Drivers faced delays with queues stretching along Beverley Road, Spring Bank and Ferensway as a road improvement scheme entered its final phase.One motorist told the Mail how a journey from Mytongate to Beverley Road took half an hour this morning when it normally takes five minutes.Improvements to the junction linking Beverley Road and Ferensway with Spring Bank and Freetown Way started on January 19 and the 12-week project is scheduled for completion this month.However, with contractors avoiding work at the site during peak morning and evening rush-hour times, more work has to be done over the weekend.Another driver, Ian Shenton, 49, told how he was caught up in traffic jams in Beverley Road as he attempted to reach East Park."It took me a good 20 minutes to finally get through the lights," said Mr Shenton, of east Hull. "I can understand them wanting to do as much as they can over the weekend when it's less busy but I think everyone will be glad when the road works are finished."On Saturday, bus company EYMS diverted buses away from Beverley Road to Princes Avenue to avoid the tailbacks.The road works have included larger traffic islands for pedestrians wishing to cross the junction, the installation of new wheelchair-friendly crossing points and new paving for people with sight problems.The 20-year-old traffic signals and underground electrical equipment have been renewed with repairs to the surfaces of the main approach roads.

Lovebirds Ian and Susan Goodwin on board their houseboat, SpadgerWidowed boaters Sue Boyce and Ian Goodwin had given up on finding love after losing their partners to illness.But romance blossomed for the couple after Ian told a pal: “What I really need is a bereaved boater.”The pair both got together when they met on the waterway in Llangollen – famous for the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.“Lots of my friends knew lots of Ian’s friends but we did not know each other,” Sue said.“For some reason, we had never met. I was talking to a friend of mine in my local pub and he said it was really difficult dating when you got older.“Ian had lost his wife and lived on a narrow boat, a life most people do not understand and he said to my friend ‘What I could do with is a bereaved boater,’” Sue said.“And I walked past. My friend waved me in and introduced us.”The pair married in St Collen’s Church, Llangollen, last month.10 things to see and do around LlangollenThey were racing against the clock to marry in the town as canal rules meant they had to leave by April 1.Sue wore a green dress while Ian was dapper in a charcoal grey suit.She fell for the retired computer programmer because he is “very patient and he’s good fun”.“We both thought we had found our soulmates and then we lost them,” the 57-year-old said.“The older you get the more difficult relationships are. It’s more difficult to gel.”Ian and Sue became friends before they fell in love.45 lakes, rivers and canals that make Wales look like heaven on earth“We did some boating together and got to know each other,” Sue said.Ian proposed on December 27 while they were watching a band called Roving Crows in Llangollen’s Sun Inn. The vicar who married them was pulling pints that night.“They have a song called ‘Woman After My Own Heart,’” Sue said.“In that there is a line that says ‘Sail away with me.’ Ian stood on the stage and said ‘Sail away and marry me.’”“Everyone in the room knew what was going to happen apart from me,” Sue said.The group announced to cheers: “If anyone missed that, Ian just proposed!”“A moment or two later I said, ‘Yes!’” Sue said.Marriage was not always on the cards for the lovebirds, who now live together on Ian’s boat, Spadger.“At first, she didn’t want to know me,” Ian said. “But after a while, she accepted my presence. I think she was just playing hard to get. That’s my take on it.”“That was in separate boats,” Ian said. “Half-way around she abandoned her boat and got on mine. The rest is history.”The dad-of-three and stepdad-of-four never thought he would find love again after losing his wife, Penny.“I had given up really,” the 63-year-old said.“I thought ‘I’m not going to find a boater.’“And then a mutual friend said, ‘Well, we know someone, it’s Sue.’“Two minutes later she came into the pub. It was like destiny.”Neither expects the other to forget their late partners.“Sue was engaged to be married and her chap sadly passed away after a massive heart attack,” Liverpool-born Ian said.“I lost my wife to pancreatic cancer. Neither of us will forget our late partners. That is a good thing and we both understand it. And with us both being boaters, it is a lot for us to have in common.”
Panama City: Hillary Clinton would be an "excellent president", US President Barack Obama said on Saturday, a day before his former secretary of state is expected to announce her campaign for the White House in 2016."She was a formidable candidate in 2008, she was a great supporter of mine in the general election, she was an outstanding secretary of state, she is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president," Mr Obama said during a news conference at the Americas summit in Panama City.Mr Obama said when Mrs Clinton makes her bid public, he expects "she will be very clear about her vision for the country moving forward".He lauded her foreign policy as the top US diplomat during his first term in office."She's going to be able to handle herself really well in any conversations that take place around foreign policy," he said, adding: "her track record with respect to domestic policy is, I think, one that cares about working families."Mrs Clinton plans to announce her long-anticipated plans through video and social media on Sunday before travelling to key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a Democrat close to the Clinton camp.Mr Obama, asked about the possibility of US Vice-President Joe Biden running to succeed him, demurred."Not only have I run in my last election, I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections," he said.
Leader of the defunct Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), Chief Ateke Tom, has said former militant leaders in the region are ready to cooperate and work with the President-Elect, General Muhammadu Buhari.Ateke, who disclosed this while speaking to newsmen at Okochiri community in Okrika local government area of Rivers State, urged Buhari to invite leaders of genuine militant camps in the Niger Delta region to discuss on how to move the region forward.He said, “I am here to congratulate Buhari for his victory. We will want good leadership; we thank God that Buhari is now our President and we pray God Almighty to give him wisdom to rule our country. Since Buhari is now our President, we want him to meet with the core leaders of the Niger Delta struggle; I mean the real leaders in the struggle.“He should call the real leaders and talk to them. Let us discuss on our needs. He should also not forget the Amnesty Programme, because we know what we fought for and that was why they gave us Amnesty. We did not get the Amnesty Programme from the backyard. So, let him keep to the programme. Let the Amnesty Programme function well and we will like it. We are ready to work with Buhari.”The former militant leader said none of the former agitators in the region will go back to the creeks or blow up pipelines as threatened by some activists in the region recently, due to the defeat of President Goodluck Jonathan in the just concluded Presidential election in the country.Ateke said, “Some people are saying they want to go back to the creek, or they want to blow up pipelines; no, I, Ateke Tom will not be part of that, we don’t need all those things and nobody will go back to the creeks. I have a say in the Niger Delta and I am one of the top fighters; so nobody will go back to the creeks. I advice the youths not to follow anybody back to the creeks.“We should not say because there is change of government and Buhari is now the President, and somebody wants to go back to the creeks; what are you going there to do? So, let nobody follow anybody to the creeks. What we want is that let Buhari meet us and treat us well.“We cannot say because Jonathan, our brother is the President and therefore under his administration, every programme and policies that were mapped out for the Niger Delta by Yar’adua before his death, have all been implemented by the Jonathan government; no. There are some of the programmes and policies that have not been implemented, and we expect Buhari to implement them when he finally takes over as President.”
Too often matters have been discussed behind closed doors. Too often in its recent past the council has chosen secrecy over openness and accountability.Earlier this year, we revealed almost one in five of the council’s decisions in 2014 were made behind closed doors.As part of the Mercury and Sunday Tasmanian’s Your Right to Know campaign, state political editor Matt Smith requested, through Right to Information legislation, the details of expense claims for Hobart’s elected members.MORE: WHY THIS PLACE IS A MONEY PITThe outcomes ran as a special investigation in yesterday’s Sunday Tasmanian and continue today.They revealed aldermen had claimed a total of $135,000 in personal expenses since 2012.We must be clear: there is no suggestion elected members have done anything illegal or in breach of council guidelines. But the investigation has raised significant questions about these very guidelines and the subsequent processes and accountability.Many of the claims had no explanation of why they were needed. Several did not have accompanying work receipts.The documents provided to this newspaper did not include expenses incurred by aldermen which are paid for directly by the council or on other corporate credit cards.We argue that the very fact journalists were forced to use RTI legislation to access what should be basic details of council spending is absurd.At the end of the day, we are talking about ratepayers’ money. Your money.The council now has a new regime and the opportunity to break down the barriers of the past. To set a fresh course. New Lord Mayor Sue Hickey has spoken about the need for greater transparency.Arguably her biggest opponent on the council, Marti Zucco, has said the same thing. There is clearly an acknowledgment there is a problem and a mood for change.In the wake of the investigation, Ald Hickey has called for a review of the council expenses process which has been started by general manager Nick Heath.This will look closely at the process which Mr Heath describes as one of “self-certification”, whereby elected members are not required to obtain council approval before making purchases and receipts are “not required but are often provided and obvious discrepancies are queried”.He has discussed the matter with the Auditor-General.Tonight the council will vote on several motions to open up its processes, including public reporting of elected members’ expenses and monthly publication of these details on the council’s website.This comes in the wake of a council motion earlier this year to suspend its policy on financial assistance for developers — following the Myer fiasco — while it works on a more transparent way to deal with investors; and demand that local government candidates across the state disclose campaign donations.The council is starting to say the right things about opening up. But the Your Right to Know investigation highlights one undeniable point: the time for talk is over.
“The abuse she has suffered left her mentally and physically traumatised,” Canadian-based aid worker Yousif Daoud, who recently returned from the region, told The Toronto Star.“This girl is so young she could die if she delivers a baby. Even caesarean section is dangerous.”The girl, a member of the persecuted Yazidi Christian minority, has been flown out of Iraq by a Kurdish aid agency and is receiving treatment in Germany.Daoud said the girl was found in “very bad shape”.“She was sexually abused by no fewer than 10 men. Most of them were frontline fighters or suicide bombers who are given girls as a reward,” he said.ISIS released more than 200 Yazidis on Wednesday, mostly women and children, after holding them captive for eight months.Daoud said ISIS released the abused women and girls “to shame the whole community”. He said the victims faced the humiliation of lost chastity.The news comes as IS militants are holding hostage at least 50 civilians, almost half of them women, seized in a raid on a village in central Syria.They were kidnapped from the village of Mabujeh in Hama province on March 31, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.News of the kidnappings had been kept quiet because of ongoing negotiations for their release, but the talks have since faltered, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.Ten of those taken, including six women, are Ismailis, a minority sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The remaining 40 are Sunni Muslims, including at least 15 women.“There are fears that the women are being taken as slaves,” Abdel Rahman told AFP.He said the Ismailis were kidnapped because IS considers them “infidels,” and that the Sunnis — although from the same sect as IS fighters — were taken because IS viewed them as “loyal to the Ismailis”.Mabujeh, east of the provincial capital Hama, has a population of Sunnis, Ismailis and Alawites, another offshoot of Shiite Islam that is the sect of President Bashar al-Assad and his clan.
Kevin Pietersen announced himself with a century – what else? - on the first day of the rest of his life at The Parks.England's celebrity Test discard had not reached three figures in any form of cricket since he saved the follow-on against Australia at Old Trafford in August 2013.But he made shelling peas and pinching sweets off kids in the playground look like hard labour as he cruised to a 110-ball hundred against Oxford University as he launched his bid for a fairytale Ashes encore this summer.And on the eve of England's first Test against the West Indies in Antigua, he could not have chosen a better time to flex his muscles and let the selectors know he is still around.Pietersen's last appearance in whites, against a red ball, was in January last year as England curled up their toes inside three days in Sydney, the final act of a 5-0 whitewash for which he was cast as scapegoat.But he pulled in the crowds and took to challenging early-season conditions like a duck to orange sauce as he rescued Surrey from their stumble to 78-4 against the students.Scapegoat: Pietersen was made one of the scapegoats for the Ashes whitewashGive or take posh twits jumping off Magdalen Bridge on May Day, Pietersen's return to action attracted the biggest crowd at Oxford University this year.Circumspect at first, KP eased through the gears without crunching the clutch once. The only time he was caught with his trousers down was to replace his thigh pad.Coming in at 31-2 in the 10th over, after business management studies undergraduate Sam Weller had removed both openers, Pietersen's march to the crease was greeted by ripples of warm applause.On a ground where he scored 62 for Notinghamshire in an early-season warm-up 11 years ago, he took eight balls to get off the mark.Determined: Pietersen with coach Graham Ford in the nets before the gameAnd thrill-seekers had to wait 45 minutes for KP to hoist off-spinner Jack McIver to the ropes at long-off for the first of his 14 boundaries.But once he had had whipped left-arm seamer Jack Grundy through midwicket with his signature flamingo stroke, it was like rolling back the plaudits to an age before Textgate and incendiary autobiographies.Once he had reached his half-century off 63 balls, Pietersen's innings became increasingly agricultural, twice clearing the keeper and slips with premeditated mows intended for cow corner.But there were also snapshots of his thrilling power, one cover drive knocking an elderly spectator off his fishing chair. There are probably hanging judges who would haul KP up before the beak at Lord's for less.One of the first players on the ground, shortly after 9am, Pietersen – as ever – was instantly recognisable.While the rest of his team-mates warmed up in regulation black training gear, KP added a cable-knit sleeveless sweater and woollen beanie hat.And at the crease, the luminous green stickers on his bat, and fluorescent orange flashes on the heels of his boots, could have brought a jumbo jet in to land on a foggy night.Before tea, with Surrey recovering on 220-5, it was not the first time he would stand out from the crowd.
But at least three other Tasmanian towns have water that cannot be consumed because of heavy metal contamination.The extent of lead contamination in some North-East areas will be revealed at a public meeting on April 21 at Pioneer — one of five towns on a “Do Not Consume” alert.Macquarie University professor Mark Taylor and researcher Paul Harvey will attend the meeting to detail results of a study to be published in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal.The results will relate to tap water, natural water and infrastructure in the Pioneer, Ringarooma and Gladstone areas.At Winnaleah, TasWater is working with the Department of Health and Human Services to determine whether a filtration system could provide fully treated water.The trial centres on a mobile nanofiltration membrane plant, a Tasmanian first, TasWater works delivery general manager Dr Dharma Dharmabalan said.“Much of the community has been unhappy with the taste and appearance of the previous alternative water supply, and following community consultation, and with the guidance from the [DHHS], in November 2014 we reinstated the bore system with a ‘Do Not Consume’ alert.”There are 27 towns with Boil Water or Do Not Consume alerts.“By 2018, we expect to have addressed water quality in 19 of these towns, with the remaining to follow,” Dr Dharmabalan said.At Pioneer, resident Jenny Bellinger said rainwater tanks were being installed but that process had been too slow.“We asked for an alternative source of water that was lead-free,” Ms Bellinger said.“What we’ve been trying to do ... is to get TasWater to come back to our hall to talk to us because most of us didn’t want tanks, we wanted an alternative water supply.”TasWater said it was regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services across all its drinking water systems.It did thousands of water quality tests across the state each year.
Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence.The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves.The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'.But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'.This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage.The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website.Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain.It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this.'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.'It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings.Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend.And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost.The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft.It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises.They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke through the shutters before spending hours in the vault - emerging the next morning carrying the gems out the building in a wheelie bin.They then returned on Saturday night, apparently repeating the process throughout the night, leaving early on the morning of Easter Sunday.The burglary was discovered on Tuesday morning.Police have now said 72 out of the vaults 999 boxes were opened.
The Department of Health and Human Services buys more than 500,000 eggs a year, the prison service more than 70,000. Soon after winning government last year, Treasurer Peter Gutwein committed to overturn the “ridiculous” rule to buy non-cage eggs.“Under Labor, local businesses couldn’t get a look in,” a government spokesman said.“We said then it wasn’t good enough and that’s why shortly after coming to office we overturned Labor and the Greens’ ridiculous free-range egg regulations, which locked out Tasmanian businesses.”The Department of Health said Tasmanian Health Organisations north and south and Custodial Youth Justice have contracts for cage eggs with Pure Foods, which provides about 477,000 Tasmanian­-produced eggs a year.THO-North West had a contract for caged eggs with PFD Food Services, a Tasmanian company that sources its eggs from Queensland.“To ensure value for money and compliance with the buy local policy, the TPS purchases local eggs at the best price it can obtain, which is usually cage eggs,” a spokeswoman said.“The TPS requests that all eggs supplied are from Tasmanian sources, however, any eggs that we order for which there is an insufficient Tasmanian supply, are supplied from Victorian sources.”RSPCA Tasmania said the move was disappointing.“We understand the economic reality the government faces, however it sends a mixed message,” general manager Peter West said.The former government gave grants to Tasmanian producers to step up their cage-free production.Greens consumer affairs spokesman Nick McKim said the previous policy showed leadership by encouraging appropriate animal welfare standards.“By changing the policy, the Liberals have endorsed animal cruelty and a lowest common denominator approach to purchasing policy,” Mr McKim said.
Aaron Leeson-Woolley should have been wearing a tux and getting ready to watch his partner of five years walk down the aisle on Saturday.Instead, he wore yellow and sat in the middle of a Riverina park as he cried and hugged the hundreds of people who knew and loved his fiancee, Stephanie Scott.The body of the popular school teacher was recovered from bushland north of Griffith on Friday, five days after she was allegedly killed by cleaner Vincent Stanford.Ms Scott's parents, brothers and sisters joined the whole town of Leeton at a memorial picnic to honour their daughter and sister.Her father, Bob, told the crowd of hundreds gathered in Mountford Park that he wanted his daughter to be remembered for the great girl she was – and not the tragic way she was taken away."Stephanie was a bubbly, bright, witty, intelligent fun-loving girl who has obviously impacted on many people here today and our wishes for the future are that she will continue in your minds. I'm sure wherever she is now that she would wish that to be the case as you remember her as that great little girl she was."Moments after the moving tribute, Ms Scott's fiance rested his head against his bride-to-be's mother, Merrilyn Scott."He's doing it a bit tougher than most, as you can imagine," said Mr Scott.Ms Scott's father said the family had been moved by women in the small Riverina town who had hung their wedding dresses on their doors as a tribute to the bride-to-be. Within hours the tribute had spread around the country as brides from Brisbane to Melbourne joined in on the symbolic gesture."She was to be married today and some of the people in town have taken out their wedding dresses and hung them on their front doors, which is a great tribute to her."After the emotional speech, Ms Scott's fiance and her family walked into the middle of the Sunday park and let dozens of yellow balloons drift into the air as people clapped and cried.Police, firefighters and volunteers who have spent the past week searching for Ms Scott have also rallied around the family.The police officer who helped find Ms Scott's body knelt down before her fiance and offered his condolences in the park.Griffith police commander Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan appeared shaken by the killing that has rocked the small community.Only hours earlier, he had spoken of how police trail bike riders discovered Ms Scott's burnt remains in Cocoparra National Park, where her alleged killer regularly camped.On Saturday morning, Stephanie's sister Kim shared a wedding poem which described the deep bond Ms Scott and her fiance shared. She had intended to read it at the couples reception which, until the tragic events of this week, was due to take place that afternoon."We couldn't be happier, it's a dream come true," she wrote. "To watch your sister find happiness and to say I do."Kim Scott recalled how her little sister and Mr Leeson-Woolley met in their hometown of Canowindra growing up. "They shared car journeys," she wrote. "Along with Dad, Stuie and me."They make each other smile, they can fill a room with love.""Joking and laughing, they fit each other like a glove. I wish you all the happiness, for the many years to come."As the family shared memories of the bright and bubbly teacher and thought of the wedding that never was, her remains were being taken to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, where an autopsy will be carried out this week.
KITCHENER — Danielle Wellerdt and Mark Doherty first met in a boxing ring. So it was only fitting the boxing enthusiasts faced off in the same ring for their first fight as husband and wife."We wanted to start our marriage in this boxing ring," Danielle, 22, said. "And we don't dance."The couple remembered their first encounter fondly. It was three years ago and Mark was Danielle's first sparring partner in the ring.She knew right then he was a knockout."I elbowed him in the face in the first 33 seconds of the fight," she said.Mark, 27, laughed and added, "Yeah, it was fun, it was a good time."The newlyweds from Cambridge stripped out of their wedding attire early Saturday afternoon and donned gym gear, mouthguards and boxing gloves.These two weren't interested in a first dance at their wedding reception — they wanted a first fight, instead.Exercise equipment was pushed aside to make room for tables, food and decorations at SydFit Health Centre, the boxing gym where they first met.About 60 friends and family members swarmed the gym in fine suits and elegant dresses.Close friends said they weren't at all surprised when Danielle and Mark said they wanted to start their marriage with a sweaty, adrenaline-pumping boxing match instead of the traditional slow dance."She is a bit outrageous and it's always a bit of an adventure," said Colin Sarkany, a friend of Danielle's for over 10 years and a groomsman. "It's going to be a real fight."Felicia Johnston, one of her bridesmaids, piped in and said: "I know she will not hold back."Mark and Danielle love a good fight. For their first Valentine's Day date, the couple went to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga to watch a live professional boxing match.They are both boxing enthusiasts and Danielle is a trainer at Syd Vanderpool's gym.With fists in the air Mark "The Destroyer" and Danielle "The Grenade Launcher" smiled at each other from opposite ends of the boxing ring.Even though she couldn't stop giggling, Danielle packed a few good, hard punches at her new husband.Mark grinned from ear to ear just giddy with joy. Three rounds later Vanderpool declared Danielle the winner.The newlyweds hugged, out of breath, while their friends and family cheered them on. It was just how they wanted it to be.Vanderpool's words of advice: "You always have to remember to fight for your marriage."Now it was time for them to get out of sweaty clothes and off to their honeymoon in cottage country.
Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are parents of a baby boy, according to a report out Saturday.The couple's first son is named Silas Randall Timberlake, reps for the two told People in confirming the birth.Beyond the name, details are reportedly being kept private for now, in line with the couple's approach to confirming the pregnancy in the first place. While word that a baby was on the way bubbled up in November and seemed to be confirmed by former N'Sync bandmate Joey Fatone in December, the new parents didn't go public until the end of January."Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes!," Timberlake said on Instagram on his 34th birthday. "This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets."The couple marked Biel's birthday in March with a low-key dinner party with friends, after he wished her well via Instagram and called her "the sweetest, most GORGEOUS, goofiest, most BAD-ASS chick I know."Dad and son now share a middle name, Randall.Biel, 33, and the "Suit and Tie" singer got engaged in early 2012 and tied the knot later that year.Follow Christie D'Zurilla on Twitter @theCDZ and Google+.

It's a sport with a truly global reach as these images of children, amateurs and professional stars playing cricket show.The stunning shots make up the short-list for the Wisden–MCC Cricket Photograph of the Year 2014, which was won by Getty Images photographer Matthew Lewis.His image of Dwayne Bravo shows the player taking a breathtaking full-length catch for the West Indies to dismiss Australia’s James Faulkner during last year’s ICC World Twenty20 competition in Bangladesh.But portraits of ordinary players also make the list, from children on a Bangladesh rubbish tip to a club player attempting a catch in Kent.
WASHINGTON - Police say the U.S. Capitol is on lockdown as a precaution after shots were fired in what appears to be an attempted suicide.Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider says the suspected shooter was "neutralized" after a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Christopher Pyne counts calories. Obsessively. The federal Education Minister admits his use of the diet tracking application MyFitnessPal verges on an addiction.Since last February, Pyne has entered everything he eats, and any exercise he does, into the app. At the end of each day he checks whether he has stayed within 1250 calories – an ambitious target given dieticians recommend the average male consume around 2200 calories a day.Pyne dropped from 83 to 73 kilograms last year – an achievement he attributes to hourly morning walks, skipping snacks and avoiding breakfast (he opts for only black tea or coffee).He is among a large group of MPs who are growing ever-mindful of their food intake, and the exercise they do. As Deputy Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce remarked in a speech to Parliament last year: "From my observation, two things happen to you in this building: you gain weight and you lose touch."The challenges politicians face in staying healthy will be familiar to many Australians. Long, unpredictable working hours. Easy access to unhealthy food. Hours spent sitting down. It's a lifestyle that makes exercise virtually essential to keeping the bulge at bay.The Education Minister's regime is certainly a far cry from when he entered politics in 1993. Pyne was aged 25, and put on a 6.3 kilograms in his first year. There were no direct flights from his Adelaide electorate to Canberra so he had to fly via Melbourne. Cooked breakfasts would be served on both flights and he would eat on both."It's very easy in politics to put on weight; you're constantly being fed," he says. "There are very few functions where food isn't included – spring rolls, party pies, it's very calorific."At the start of each term of Parliament, an initiation session is held for newly-elected politicians. One of the key messages is: take care of your fitness."You are told that some MPs will put on 10kg in first term," says Labor MP Ed Husic, who entered Parliament in 2010.  "You have to be mindful of all your lifestyle choices because you see people literally growing in front of your eyes." Prime Minister Tony Abbott, of course, is a famous athlete – participating in 14-hour iron-man events, volunteer fire fighting and racing in the annual pollie pedal charity bike race. After winning government, he had a treadmill installed in his office so he could exercise during bad weather.Treasurer Joe Hockey, who had gastric bypass surgery in 2012, is regularly seen playing squash at the Parliament House gym in the early morning. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop jogs for 6 kilometres each morning on overseas trips.Bishop's predecessor, Bob Carr, generated guffaws around the country last year by writing of his passion for steel-cut oats, the "wonderful one-legged Romanian deadlift" and his desire to achieve "a concave abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques".John Howard was famous for his brisk early morning walks and John Hewson became known as Amphetamine Man for his long dawn runs while opposition leader.During the 1993 election, Hewson would schedule press conferences at the end, and sometimes the start, of his runs – a habit that infuriated the travelling press pack. One morning in Hobart the photographers hinted at their displeasure by showing up in their pyjamas and bathrobes.Paul Keating took to bouncing on a trampoline, an activity he believed would clean out the arteries and, one biographer claimed, even ward off cancer.But Ed Husic says there's no doubt today's politicians are paying increasing attention to diet and exercise."There's a growing belief that you can't perform at your best if you're not looking after yourself," says Husic, a passionate basketballer.Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has seen the benefits first hand. Like many men, Bowen says he was fit in his youth but let himself go in his 30s. When he turned 40 two years ago he decided to take action.He has since lost 17 kilograms by avoiding dessert, eating fewer carbohydrates and doing 45 minutes of weights and cardio each morning."I feel fitter and more energetic than I ever have," he says. "I used to get pretty tired and I just put that down to the job and the demands. Now I realise that I was going around with an extra load."One of Parliament's larger politicians, Liberal National Party member Ewan Jones, says being overweight can hold back a politician's career."People look at you and think you're lazy, that you can't do the job," says Jones, who hovers between 120 and 150 kilograms. "You only get one chance to make a first impression."Jones has recently tried the intermittent (5:2) fasting diet in which you eat normally for five days a week and fast on the other two – a current favourite among many politicians. He admits it has been a struggle: "It's very hard when someone walks past you with a rice-paper roll," he says.A commitment to fitness carries risks as well as rewards, as some politicians have discovered. In 1990, speaker Leo McLeay broke his arm and suffered facial injuries when a bike he had rented from Parliament House collapsed underneath him. He later won $65,000 in compensation. Today's elected representatives keen to cruise around Capital Hill must now provide their own set of wheels.
The US Capitol Building has been placed on lockdownOne federal official told NBC News that there were "no indications at this point of terrorism".Police were also investigating a suspicious package close to the complex, which was later reported to be the suspected shooter's suitcase.There are no indications at this point of terrorismAccording to several Twitter users, the person who was shot was a protester.Some described the individual as holding a placard which read: "Tax the 1 per cent."The building was placed on lockdown on Saturday as a precautionary measure, with no one being allowed to enter or exit the area.Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement: "The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit."She added shortly afterwards: "Confirmed: self-inflicted gunshot by neutralized subject."Few lawmakers are currently in the area as Congress is out of session this week.
Hollywood icon Raquel Welch has spoken of how she launched a furious attack on her father as a child after snapping over his cruel behaviour.The actress said she was “terrified” of Armando, who once held her head under a faucet and made her cut her hair off.She finally flipped at 16 when she saw him throw milk over mum Josephine after complaining about her cooking – screaming out and flying at him with a poker.Raquel said: “I think my mum rather liked it but he was shocked.“He didn’t treat my mother very nicely. I picked up the poker at the fireplace and came at him and said, ‘Don’t you ever do that to mother again or I’ll…’“He was stunned. I had never thought about confronting my father like that, it was just an instinct.“I thought it was cruel, demeaning and totally uncalled for. She was phenomenal, she was a wonderful woman.“I didn’t like the way that you could be with a man and he could treat you so badly and he’s your husband.”Innocent: Raquel was "just a kid in pigtails"The 74-year-old, who sent pulses racing in her fur-kini in 1966’s One Million Years BC, was also berated by her dad for paying attention to her looks.She revealed that when she started junior high school at 13 she got her braids cut into a shorter style “with curls and all pretty and girly”. But Armando, an aeronautical engineer from Bolivia, was livid.Speaking on Piers Morgan’s ITV show Life Stories, Raquel said: “My father was a tough customer. He was very strict, I was terrified of him and there were times I disliked him.“When I came home with that haircut, he ran my head under the faucet. He didn’t like it. He said ‘Cut it, you’re not having curls like that!’ So I had very short hair."He didn’t want me to be too girly, I think he didn’t want me to get involved with boys too early. I just hated that he was clipping my wings.“But at the same time I had enormous respect for him and I did want to please him.”Glamorous: The actress became an iconRaquel was born Jo Raquel Tejada in Chicago in 1940 and dad Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo hailed from La Paz while mum Josephine Sarah was from the US.The star married childhood sweetheart James Welch at 18 after becoming pregnant and they had children Damon, now 55, and Latanne, 53, before splitting after four years.She married producer Patrick Curtis in 1966 and divorced him in 1972, then in 1980 began a 10-year marriage with producer and director André Weinfeld.She wed fourth husband Richard Palmer in 1999 but they separated in 2008 – and she has said she does not intend to marry again.Speaking about life in Beverly Hills at 74, Raquel said: “Being seen as a sex symbol and getting older, you know, it does make you very self-conscious.“Fortunately, because of my dancing background I was very disciplined about physical fitness. I also bumped into yoga when I was 40. What people don’t realise is it’s not just a crazy exercise where you get into odd poses, it’s very scientifically designed.”
WHETHER you want to kick-back in the music room or sit out on a balcony in this south-facing home, this property has it all - especially for beach lovers. Weekend's CHRIS CAMPBELL takes a look.MOMENTS away from Bracelet Bay is this four bedroom property offering a perfect family spot with outstanding sea views.In fine weather, the owners enjoy a dip in the sea before returning back to their home in Cleveland Avenue, Limeslade - what they call their Californian beach house - for a barbecue.They have many a peaceful evening, with the blinds of the impressive conservatory open, letting the moonlight in as they drift off to sleep.This conservatory and the spacious open plan lounge/dining room have wonderful views out to sea.Two en suite shower rooms and a bathroom mean that when their sons or guests come to stay there is plenty of space for privacy.The owner, who has lived at the house with his wife for almost five years and did not wish to be named, says the south-facing layout of the house meant it is perfect for enjoying sunshine throughout the day."It's very easy to live here," he says. "We have lived by the sea most of our lives but this is different. We describe it as our equivalent to a Californian beach house."Our sons come home with their partners and they have their own rooms and space."The couple re-laid two patios, to the front and back of the property, and a picket fence runs around the house. This includes six gateways. It means children can play in certain areas and it was helpful when letting their late Labrador outside.Through the hallway, the kitchen also has sea views, with a window to the front.The lounge has an attractive beamed ceiling and there is a wall-mounted, flame effect gas fire, with a remote control. A purple painted wall - the couple have had the inside and outside of the house repainted - complements the wooden beams and adds a splash of colour to an otherwise neutral coloured home.See these four housing schemes which could change the face of SwanseaA wooden staircase can also be found in this room as well as a painting of the coast on the wall, plus family photographs. The space is well-used and shouts comfort.There are two good-size balconies offering those great views and where morning coffee and newspapers or evening drinks can be enjoyed. The view is a lovely mix of nature, nearby houses and, of course, the sea.A four suite bathroom can be found on this floor, with a walk-in shower and under floor heating. The bathroom also has a built-in sound system.Two bedrooms with beamed ceilings and built-in wardrobes can be found on the first floor, plus one of the en suite shower rooms.Those wanting to play or listen to a little music and enjoy a few drinks, can head to the basement, where there is a music room - with guitar - and bar. This is actually the same level as the garden and has doors out onto it. Bedrooms three and four, again with built-in wardrobes, can be found here. There is an en suite too, with wooden flooring and a step-in shower.An attractive, newly resurfaced lane leading to the property at the front creates driveway parking for several cars. There is also a garden here.To the back, an attractive patio leads onto the south-facing lawned garden area. A raised decked area is to the side.Cleveland Avenue is close to Mumbles and the beach-side promenade, boutique shops, wine bars and traditional pubs it offers.The owner adds: "This house is made up of different layers. It's got everything, whether you're enjoying a barbecue after the beach or want to relax in the music room on the lower floor."The property: Four-bedroom detached house, which makes the most of its stunning viewsWho lives here: Older couple. Their children come back to visit.The look: Modern and open with beach house feel but with beamed ceilings.Lessons learnt: Find a south-facing home to make the most of the sunshine throughout the day.
It was the match of the day as Bobby Moore's granddaughter kicked off married life - full of joyful highlights but missing a couple of key players.The granddaughter of the England ­football hero married her childhood sweetheart at Chelsea register office in front of 12 loved ones.Poppy Moore and Sam Myers, both 23, then held the second leg at a London’s Mayfair Hotel with 50 guests.Poppy carried a picture of her late dad Dean in her wedding bouquet. He died of natural causes in July 2011, aged 43.She was just 18 months old when in February 1993 granddad Bobby, who captained England’s 1966 World Cup winning side, died of bowel cancer, aged 51.Tragic: Bobby Moore with granddaughter Poppy the day after he revealed he had cancerHer mum Sara said: “Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all.“It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.”Poppy marked the 20th anniversary of the legend's death in 2013 with his two other grandchildren, Freddie and Ava. They placed the ball on the spot for a West Ham home game - the club he skippered for ten years.Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer.Moore, who would have been 74 today, won 108 England caps, including 90 as captain and was ­described by Brazil legend Pele as “the greatest defender I ever played against”.

DUNBLANE (UNITED KINGDOM) - Tennis ace Andy Murray married his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane's 12th century cathedral on Saturday, bringing his Scottish hometown to a standstill.The newlyweds came under a shower of confetti as they left the church at 5.40 pm (1640GMT), just over an hour after they arrived.Sears wore a white dress with a plunging neckline, lace sleeves and a long train carried by four bridesmaids while the groom wore a green and blue tartan kilt.A bagpiper earlier welcomed the 2013 Wimbledon champion into the church while Sears arrived in a car a few minutes later, to a peel of applause from the gathered crowds.Ahead of the service, Murray posted a series of "emojis" to his 2.98 million Twitter followers, revealing his plans for the day. They ended with cocktails, kisses and several Zzzz sleep symbols.Despite earlier hailstorms, the sun shone on family and friends as they arrived for the intimate service in Dunblane Cathedral, which was decorated with huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized blossom trees.With an eye on the skies, Murray's mother Judy tweeted: "Hailstones. Marvellous" and then later "Snowing. #whitewedding".Murray revealed that his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier were to share best man duties.Several fans camped overnight to catch a glimpse of the couple and the streets were festooned with bunting in scenes usually reserved for a royal wedding.Reverend Colin Renwick, who married the couple, received huge cheers as he arrived at the cathedral.The 27-year-old Sears has already become accustomed to the limelight, often finding herself in the cameraman's sights while watching Murray courtside at events all around the world.She too grew up in a tennis-loving home with father Nigel Sears formerly the LTA's head of women's tennis.Shedding her demure image, Sears hit the front pages during this year's Australian Open when she was filmed muttering expletives in the direction of the box of Czech opponent Tomas Berdych.She turned up at the next match wearing a "parental advisory explicit content" jersey.Sears was once described by Judy Murray as "the best thing to happen to Andy".But he reportedly upset her when in January this year he sent a 'joke' message to a fan saying: "We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day," only to have to issue a retraction in a follow-up tweet.The world number three player is hosting the reception at his own 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, which he bought two years ago for pound sterling1.9 million ($2.8 million, 2.6 million euros).Pubs in the town got into the spirit, offering champagne and strawberries to mark the occasion.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered her support, saying: "Andy is a local hero there but he is also a Scottish sporting superstar, and the whole nation will be delighted for him and his new wife."The grand slam champion predicted few nerves come game time."We've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well," he said."So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change."Murray and Dunblane share a painful past after the town was hit by tragedy in March 1996 when Thomas Hamilton shot 16 pupils and a teacher dead at the Scot's primary school.The tennis player, who had to hide in the school during the massacre, broke down in tears when discussing it during a television interview.
South Carolina grandmother Joyce Kuhl has launched a new class lawsuit against the SeaWorld center in Orlando, Florida - in which she accuses the marine park of trying to mask "the ugly truth about the unhealthy and despairing lives of these whales". In the lawsuit, she claims the orcas in the Orlanda park are kept in 8ft deep holding pools - supposedly leaving them with horrific sunburn. She then alleges that the resulting burns are so bad, staff are forced to PAINT over the wounds with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries. The lawsuit also claims that chlorine solution "many times stronger than household bleach" is being used in tanks where the whales are confined after being caught or bred. "These orcas suffer in tiny, unnatural chemical tubs," the court document states.The creatures are also forced to go days without food while being trained, the lawsuit alleges. And it also claims that the whales are "subject to drugging" to help calm them when they react against conditions in their confinement. "Perhaps most telling, captive orcas are also subject to drugging by SeaWorld personnel with antipsychotic and psychoactive drugs, including benzodiazepines such as Diazepam (generic Valium), which are given to calm the captive orcas which react against their conditions of confinement," the lawsuit states. Ms Kuhl pointed out in the document that in the wild, orcas live between 30 and 50 years - whereas she said most orcas in SeaWorld die in their teens or 20s.She is now seeking to have her $97 ticket money from her December 2013 trip reimbursed - as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, the Orlando Sentinel reports. SeaWorld Florida is visited by over 5 million people a year, according to the lawsuit. At around $100 a ticket, this means the park could potentially be sued for at least $2billion. On Friday, SeaWorld said it "is committed in every respect to the health and well-being of the animals in our care" and said the lawsuit "appears to be an attempt by animal right extremists to use the courts to advance an anti-zoo agenda". They continued: "The suit is baseless, filled with inaccuracies, and SeaWorld intends to defend itself against these inaccurate claims." The Guardian was told by a source that Ms Kuhl is not an animal rights activist, but "an ordinary animal lover" who found out information after visiting the aquatic park that was "inconsistent" with the company's marketing. This is the second time that SeaWorld has been sued in less than three weeks, after a class action lawsuit was filed in California last month. The California lawsuit targets all three SeaWorld locations - San Diego in California, San Antonio in Texas and Orlando in Florida.
British comedian Russell Brand has tweeted his support for saving Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from an Indonesian firing squad.Saturday's tweet from Brand (@rustyrockets) reads: "These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP! info.mercycampaign.org/watch/."The tweet includes a link to the website of the campaign for mercy for the convicted drug traffickers, where video interviews of the pair can be viewed and a petition signed.Brand is well known for his outspoken views on politics and human rights and in February blasted Australia's policy of using offshore migrant detention centres.Chan and Sukumaran's fight to avoid execution last week moved to Indonesia's constitutional court after they lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court.The pair's lawyers on Thursday sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency.Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the latest challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it.Jakarta is now just waiting on the legal efforts of a few other death row prisoners before setting an execution date.The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island, where Indonesia plans to execute them by firing squad.
WASHINGTON - A person shot him or herself dead near the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, sparking a security lockdown at the complex, U.S. Capitol police said.Police were also investigating a suspicious package on the lower west terrace of the Capitol building in Washington, and several nearby streets were closed. Several media reports said it was luggage left by the person.Police said the lockdown was a precautionary measure."There are no indications at this point of terrorism," a U.S. official told NBC News."The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit," Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement.She did not say if the person was a man or a woman.The incident occurred on a Saturday and Congress is out of session this week, so few lawmakers were in town. But the city was crowded with tourists visiting for the popular annual Cherry Blossom festival.
Washington: At 115, Jeralean Talley is now the world's oldest person. The American leads the elite club of "supercentenarians" – people more than 111 years old.It's not as small a club as you may think. More than 50 people, carefully tallied by US researchers, have passed the milestone.After Monday's death of fellow American Gertrude Weaver, who would have turned 117 on July 4, Talley is the oldest person recorded by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG),An African American, she was born in the southern US state of Georgia at the tail end of the 19th century on May 23, 1899. These days she lives near Detroit.Talley is part of even more restricted club of three people recorded as having seen three centuries: the final years of the 19th, the full sweep of the 20th and the start of the 21st.In this she joins Susannah Mushatt Jones, also an African American, born July 6, 1899 and Italy's Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, born November 29, 1899."There is always a small chance that there's somebody out that has not applied. To show up at 116 is not very likely but it's still possible," said Robert Young, a GRG researcher and an expert for Guinness World Records.The GRG, which bases its tally on the work of researchers, demographers, biologists and amateur enthusiasts, has for now counted 52 people – 50 women and two men – who have surpassed 111 years and can prove it with a birth certificate and marriage certificates for surname changes.Peru's Filomena Taipe, who local authorities said died on Monday at the age of 117, did not have original proof of birth, said Young.The Peruvian government said she was born on December 20, 1897, the date on her national identity card."Ninety-nine per cent of people that claim to be over 115 turn out to be false," the researcher said.He estimated at more than 1000 the number of people who may be 110, and at around 300 those who have been certified as having that many years under their belt.Talley took the title held for five days by Weaver following the death of Japan's Misao Okawa. She died on April 1, less than a month after turning 117.Talley told the Detroit Free Press that the secret to her longevity comes "from above"."That's the best advice I can give you. It's not in my hands or your hands," she said, pointing toward the heavens.Time magazine, who contacted her family, including her only daughter, 77-year-old Thelma Holloway, said the new doyenne eats lots of pork, is a true night owl and kept up her bowling hobby until the age of 104.On her birthdays, she likes to go fishing.Slightly younger, Susannah Mushatt Jones, born in Alabama, has no children but for many years she looked after those of rich families.She studied "negro music in France" and likes fine lingerie and barbecues, according to US media reports.These supercentenarians, Young said, are people who "have taken care of themselves, they stay independent, they are mentally strong."They have social networks such as church and family," he added.They stayed active for a long time, sleep well and eat in moderation, he added."It's like winning the genetic lottery, but it's not enough. You also have to live your life the right way," Young said."You have to keep your vices in check."Sarah Knauss, an american who died at the age of 119, hated vegetables and Jeanne Calment of France, who died at the age of 122, smoked two or three cigarettes a day, he added.The number of supercentenarians could well grow because life expectancy is growing and the world population is also increasing. Documentation is also easier to come by, although Africa, China and India lag behind in this.He said that the number of people reaching 115 is going to increase slowly.The record for the person to have lived the longest – and with papers to prove it – is still held by Calment of France. She passed away in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days.
President Barack Obama declared his refusal to refight the Cold War battles of the past while Cuban President Raul Castro rallied to his defence, absolving Obama of fault for the U. blockade in a stunning reversal of more than 50 years of animosity between the two countries.Castro, in an hour-long speech to the Summit of the Americas in Panama City, ran through an exhaustive history of perceived Cuban grievances against the US dating back more than a century - a vivid display of how raw passions remain over American attempts to undermine Cuba's government.Then, in an abrupt about face, he apologised for letting his emotions get the best of him. He said many US presidents were at fault for that troubled history - but that Obama isn't one of them."I have told President Obama that I get very emotional talking about the revolution," Castro said through a translator, noting that Obama wasn't even born when the US began sanctioning the island nation."I apologise to him because President Obama had no responsibility for this."In a remarkable vote of confidence from a Cuban leader, Castro added: "In my opinion, President Obama is an honest man."Castro and Obama were expected to meet later tonight on the sidelines of the summit - the first substantial meeting between a US and Cuban president in more than five decades. The flurry of diplomacy was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their previously announced plan to restore normal relations between the US and Cuba.Speaking just before Castro, Obama acknowledged that deep differences between their countries would persist. Yet he said he was uninterested in getting bogged down in ideology, instead casting the thaw in relations as an opening to create "more opportunities and resources for the Cuban people"."The United States will not be imprisoned by the past," President Barack Obama said. "We're looking to the future."Raising the stakes even higher for the two leaders was mounting speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit taking place in Panama to announce his decision to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, a gesture that for Cuba holds both practical and symbolic value.The US long ago stopped accusing Cuba of conducting terrorism, and Obama has signalled that he's ready to take Cuba off the list. On Thursday, he suggested an announcement was imminent when he revealed that the State Department had completed its lengthy review of the designation.Obama arrived at the summit for a day of marathon meetings with leaders from across the Western Hemisphere, gathered around a massive oval table with two birds of peace in the middle.A successful relaunch of US-Cuba relations would form a cornerstone of Obama's foreign policy legacy. But it is an endeavour he cannott undertake alone: Only Congress can fully lift the onerous US sanctions regime on Cuba, and there are deep pockets of opposition in the US to taking that step.
President John Mahama and his government must investigate the tirade of deputy trade and industry minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed and reprimand him, Editor-in-chief of the New Crusading Guide newspaper Kweku Baako has said.Mr Baako told Joy FM’s news analysis programme newsfile Saturday that Mr Muhammed’s “utterances are weighty enough to warrant some level of investigations.”In his view, the Nanton MP “must be held accountable and [asked to] provide answers”.According to him, “He is already a problem. The presidency may have to take a look at him.”“The allegations that he made ought to be investigated. Personally he has damaged himself in many ways. A deputy minister of state does not take to radio to say those things…” Mr Baako told host Samson Lardy Anyenini.“I will expect that a certain public reprimand or show of some public sanction ought to be meted out.”Mr Muhammed, in an interview on Tamale-based Diamond FM, recently accused a fellow legislator in the same governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) of scheming to court disaffection for him in his own constituency and eventually get him out.“It is pathetic, absolutely pathetic: it’s unethical, it’s so funny, it’s so stupid, it’s so silly, it’s nasty, it’s un-Islamic for people in the same party to be sitting down and their intention is about how they can get someone out of Parliament,” he burst out.He warned the chiefs, Mallams and party elders in the constituency against restraining him if he began speaking out to expose his detractors, since in his opinion, those leaders are not speaking against his detractors because they have been bought with “filthy, ill-gotten money”.Apart from his radio outburst, Mr Muhammed alleged on his Facebook page recently that a fellow MP, who is also a Minister hired a girl and equipped her with a tablet so she could get nude pictures of a fellow Cabinet Minister.He was summoned by the presidency over the allegations.

At last, redemption for our brown and pleasant land. "When I look at the map and see what an ugly country Australia is," Oscar Wilde wrote a hundred and a bitty years ago, "I feel that I want to go there and see if it cannot be changed into a more beautiful form." This week though, American astronaut Scott Kelly gazed down and saw something better than a mere map, he saw the continent in its entirety. He was moved enough to tweet: "#Australia. You are very beautiful. Thanks for being there to brighten our day." Beam us up, Scotty! A pleasure. Fly well.One of our heroesAs we speak, TFF is writing a book on the battle of Fromelles and Pozieres where, in a period of around six weeks Australia suffered a staggering 28,000 casualties – with more men killed in just 14 hours at Fromelles than in the Boer War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Iraq and Afghanistan put together. One of the casualties was Victorian woodcutter Albert Jacka, who had already distinguished himself by being Australia's first recipient of a Victoria Cross for his courage under fire at Gallipoli. At Pozieres on August 7, he doubled the dose, and many considered him unlucky not to win a second Victoria Cross, though personally, Jacka was just glad to have narrowly survived, having been wounded seven times in the action. He went on to be mayor of St Kilda, and when he died in 1932, his coffin was borne by eight fellow winners of the VC. .I applaud Bill Shorten, urging the government to tighten the rules which allow conscientious objectors to omit having their children vaccinated, if they fill out a form stating they have a "personal, philosophical, religious or medical belief involving a conviction that vaccination should not take place..." I don't get him allowing an enduring exception for those with strong religious beliefs against it. This is not philosophically coherent. We, as a society, have rightly decided we have a duty of care to all our children to ensure they are vaccinated. How is that duty abrogated because the parents of a child decide their particular Magic Sky Daddy is against it? Too bad. The duty of care to the child clearly outweighs the parents' adherence to superstitions. And while you may disagree because of your own superstitions, the State, surely, must be free of them, and so insist.Up at the Cross's Bourbon & Beefsteak, there's this barman, see, who is so sure that he is the strongest man around that, with the blessing of his boss – who figures it's good for business – he offers a standing $100 bet ... What he does, follow, is use the power in his massive forearms and hands to squeeze a lemon until all the juice runs into a glass, and then hands the lemon to the patron. Anyone who can squeeze two more drops of juice out of it wins the money. They come, they go, over the years. Weightlifters, dockworkers, footballers, wrestlers, gym junkies from that all-night gym down on Crown Street, but nobody ever manages to do it!One day, though, this scrawny little bloke comes into the bar, wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a polyester suit. He sits down, orders a glass of draft beer and spots the sign on the wall about the lemon challenge. "I was just reading your sign," he says in a small voice, "and I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter dies down, the bartender says, "OK". Grabbing the lemon, he squeezes it until the pips squeak, and hands the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little fellow. Without any further ado, the customer clenches his little fist around the lemon ... and six drops fall into the glass. As the crowd cheers, the stunned bartender pays the bloke his money, and asks the obvious: "Do you mind if I ask what do you do for a living? Are you a dockworker, a weight-lifter, or what?"The little fellow quietly replies: "I work for the tax department."They said it"As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well.

If there's one thing the government, opposition and business are agreed on it is the importance of Asia and the Pacific in Australia's future development.Central to our engagement is knowledge of the region's cultures and languages, so you would think that the key school at the Australian National University teaching and researching these subjects would be booming.But not so.  A budget review has found that the school of Culture, History and Language - the major Asian languages teaching school at the university - is running at a loss.According to the director of the school, Professor Ken George, a budget review in the first half of 2014 revealed that "operational costs attached to CHL's current structure, activities, and strategic vision had exceeded actual and anticipated revenues".Those conditions persist, he says, in a recent statement telling all staff and students that an academic review of the school would help renew its intellectual mission, redraw its institutional design and set plans to ensure its sustainability as a globally visible, world-leading centre for research and teaching.As part of this review all staff have been ordered to assess their own performance and academics, including professors, are being called in individually and asked to consider early retirement, continuity, redeployment, or redundancy.Insiders say morale has plummeted with senior staff getting the impression they are no longer wanted.The process is also reviving memories of the ANU School of Music debacle when the university cut 23 academic and nine administrative staff in 2012.ACT branch of the National Tertiary Education Union president Jack Bowers says the ANU has used the term review in the past as a code word for what the union considers to be the wholesale decimation of schools. Internal accounting had frequently been used as a justification for reviews and that seemed to be the case now.Others suggest the shake-up and the morale-destroying one-on-one staff interviews are influenced by financial considerations.The university has a central voluntary early retirement fund and if senior staff leave early their accumulated entitlements can be paid out of this fund.This would save the school itself from having to make redundancy payments in the event of a downsizing. In the case of redundancy the school would be required to pay three weeks' salary for each year of service with a minimum payment of five weeks' pay and maximum of 68 weeks.Professor Veronica Taylor, the Dean of the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, in which the school resides, says as part of identifying options to strengthen the school, academic staff are "being invited to think about their own professional pathways, and - for senior staff - whether now is a good time to consider early retirement or pre-retirement planning"."The review is in its early stages and no staff or part of the school have been identified for redundancies," she says.But many of the staff who have been asked to consider continuity, voluntary early retirement, redeployment, or redundancy see it differently.One of the dangers is that the most valued staff – those most likely to be wanted by other institutions – will be the first to leave.The one-on-one interviews with the discussions of redundancy options are being held before an external review panel begins an examination later this year to determine the precise role, excellence, innovativeness and sustainability of the school.Given the way the process is being handled, some staff, in key positions that the university would want to maintain, may well have decided to leave before the panel brings down its recommendations.The school may well find it's not easy to get replacements and its reputation will suffer accordingly.There is also the question of who will carry on teaching and supervising PhD candidates if senior academics leave.The ANU is proud of its high standing in world university rankings, usually either ranking as the highest or second highest Australian university.This is in large part due to its international outlook and its performance in Arts and Humanities.The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, for example, gives the university an overall score of 66.5 but in the five categories of teaching, international outlook, industry outcome, research and citations the highest score it gets is the 91.3 in international outlook.Slashing a school which must be making a major contribution to this score hardly seems sensible.The school also boasts four members holding prestigious Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowships – the highest number of such fellowships in any school at the university.Eight years have gone by since the College of Asia and the Pacific's conceptual launch in 2006 and six since its 2008 strategic review.The school of Culture, History and Language within CAP was formally constituted in 2010, making its review seem premature.Professor Taylor acknowledges that the typical review cycle in the university is six to seven years.She says other academic units within her College and across the ANU are scheduled for reviews on this cycle.In 2012, then opposition leader Tony Abbott drew attention to the fact that Australia was supposed to be adapting to the Asian century but Australians' study of foreign languages, especially Asian languages, was in precipitous decline.From every perspective - trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea, understanding of threats and conflict in the region, business, tourism, culture, environmental destruction – knowledge of the languages of the region and high level university research is essential.If the school is indeed running at a loss then perhaps the solution is to find ways to boost revenue rather than cut staff.Better marketing of what the school has to offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students would be a start.Scaring those with the foremost knowledge of the Asia Pacific region into leaving the ANU is not the way of the future.
Hundreds of mourners have gathered for the funeral of Walter Scott, an unarmed black suspect who was shot dead by a white officer in South Carolina as he fled following a routine traffic stop.Mr Scott's death, which a bystander caught on video, reignited debates about excessive police force and race relations in the United States.His body arrived on Saturday at Word Ministries Christian Centre where family, friends, politicians and law enforcement gathered to bury the 50-year-old father of four.Mr Scott's casket was draped in an American flag and a Dallas Cowboys sign in honour of his favourite football team.An estimated 200 to 300 people gathered outside the church as the family entered, and a funeral program showed photos of the family along with the words "We Will Miss You".South Carolina senator Tim Scott posted on Twitter ahead of the funeral: "Attending Walter Scott's homegoing service. Thankful to have been able to pray and talk with his family this week."Reverend James Johnson, president of the local chapter of civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network, said he hoped Mr Scott's death would lead to something good."This is a sad day," Reverend Johnson said ahead of the service."God has got a reason for what has happened. Hopefully this will heal the world."The officer who killed Mr Scott, 33-year-old Michael Slager, was charged with murder and fired from the force. He faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.The bystander video shows Mr Scott running from Slager, who pulls his gun and fires eight shots, five of which hit Mr Scott.An earlier dash cam video shows Mr Scott's car being pulled over by Slager, who asks for Mr Scott's registration before Mr Scott runs away after Slager returns to his own vehicle.Mr Scott's father said his son may have been running because he owed child support and did not want to return to jail.South Carolina police said they were suspicious of the shooting from the beginning because of "inconsistencies" in Slager's initial reporting of events and multiple gunshot wounds in Mr Scott's back.Slager had said he felt threatened during his encounter with Mr Scott.North Charleston mayor Keith Summey said the city's police would be required to wear body cameras in the future to record interactions with the public.US congressman James Clyburn, who was among the 500 people at the funeral, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered."Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea," Mr Clyburn said.Mr Scott had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support and was forced out of the US Coast Guard in 1986 after more than two years' service because of a drug offence.He was nonetheless discharged under honourable conditions because he had a good record of service, the Coast Guard said.Demonstrators gathered for peaceful protests in North Charleston after the killing, with some demanding the city council create a citizens review board to look into police conduct.Mr Scott's family called for greater accountability among police and hoped Mr Scott's death would spark reform within the force.His shooting came in the wake of a series of similar incidents that have provoked outrage and protests across the United States, most notoriously the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri last August.There are no comprehensive national statistics on how many people die at US police hands each year.Human Rights Watch estimates that out of a reported more than 2,700 police-involved deaths deemed "justifiable" by authorities between 2005-2011, just 41 officers were charged.The US Justice Department has launched investigations into a number of police departments, including Ferguson's, after shootings.
PHILADELPHIA - The Senators wrote their own version of Philadelphia Freedom Saturday afternoon ... a ticket to the playoffs.The most historic comeback in NHL history is complete.Fourteen points out of a playoff spot on Feb. 10, the Senators went a remarkable 23-4-4 in their last 31 games by closing out the season with an incredible 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at the Wells Fargo Center.Not since the 1993-94 New York Islanders came from 12 points back has a team closed a larger gap to make the post-season.Like they have on so many nights throughout this incredible run, the Senators turned to Andrew (The Hamburglar) Hammond, who was brilliant with 34 stops while Mark Stone scored twice and Jean-Gabriel Pageau chipped in to beat Philadelphia goalie Steve Mason on the 22 shots he faced.The Senators will have to watch Hockey Night in Canada to find out who they face in the first round. The New York Rangers have been ruled out but depending on the outcome of Saturday night's games it could either be the Montreal Canadiens or the Tampa Bay Lightning.It wasn't the Senators best effort but Stone put it away in the third with his 26th of the season on a breakaway. Hammond moved his record to 20-1-2. Wow.Ahead 2-1 after 40 minutes, the Senators were fortunate to be in that position.They were outshot 30-13 through two periods by the Flyers and were being completely outplayed. Hammond had to come up huge, otherwise, there's not a hope the Senators are in the lead.For a long time, the Senators looked like they needed a walk-up call at a time they were having their afternoon naps. That came midway through the second period when coach Dave Cameron read them the riot act because he didn't like what was happening on the ice one bit.The Senators were outshot 16-8 but Pageau's 10th of the season at 16:18 gave the club the lead. Defenceman Marc Methot did a great job taking the puck coast-to-coast and then Pageau, who had plenty of chances, went to the net and beat Mason on the glove side putting it home at 16:18.Sitting back trying to protect the lead, the Senators got burned only 1:23 into the second when Read tied it up. He was left alone in front of the net and all he had to do was take a pass from Brayden Schenn to beat Hammond on glove side to tie it up and make everybody in Ottawa nervous.The Senators weren't sure what to make of their start.They were outshot 14-5 by the Flyers but led where it counted the most with a 1-0 advantage on the scoreboard. Hammond wasn't tested a whole lot but did make a good stop on Brayden Schenn down low on a power play. The Senators did go stretch of almost 13 minutes without a shot on Mason.While they had a few good opportunities, it was a gift-goal that opened the scoring on the power play for Ottawa. Mason misplayed the puck in his own end by giving it to Clarke MacArthur in the circle, he threw it to Stone in the slot and all he had to do was put it into an open net at 6:06.The Senators are expected to open the playoffs in Tampa or Montreal Thursday.
Listening to a diner asking about the provenance of the chicken she was about to order, whether the juices served at the cafe were organic and if their vinegar was in fact gluten free, I was left wondering where I'd observed this devotion to purity before.The idea of sanctity has a hard time gaining traction in an increasingly secular Australia, and invoking "purity" when it comes to sex and our bodies is likely to see you roasted by feminists and flirty footballers alike.Despite this, there are many conservatives in this country, and billions more worldwide, who view promiscuity, virginity, abortion, contraception – and the "purity" these practices ensure or defile – as moral issues with distinctly right and wrong answers governed by universal law.In turn, you don't have to go far to find a Greens voter or small-l liberal who considers meat eating, factory farming, genetically modified foods, pesticides and the environmental degradation caused by all of the above as equally pressing moral concerns, governed by that same universal law.Listening to the likes of Pete Evans preach about paleo, Sarah Wilson sermonise about sugar, or any number of TV chefs pontificate about macrobiotics, ancient grains, the terroir of heirloom tomatoes and the need to use the "freshest" foods available, you'd have to admit there's more than a pinch of piety going around when it comes to food.Get a certain type of hipster started about water quality, coffee beans and cold-pressed juice and you might as well pull up an ironic deconstruction of a stool and take a seat for the duration of the ensuing monologue.What's interesting, however, is the inability of both ends of the political spectrum to take seriously the other's views on purity, while being deadly serious about the obvious nature of their own conceptions.The further you travel along both these  paths of belief, the more likely you'll also encounter "magic" and pseudo-scientific claims backed by little evidence but plenty of faith. Last week's epic takedown of the American 'Food Babe' blogger by an actual scientist is an amusing case in point.While it's difficult to argue with the data on the benefits of cutting down on red meat, sugar and cholesterol, many of the more fashionable assertions made by foodie evangelists seem to occupy the same gormless, glowing gap in the firmament where Our Lord Allah Jehovah Yahweh the Sky Wizard lives.Many liberals would passionately argue that notions of religious and bodily purity – and its close relative sanctity – have no place in discussions of morality, yet they are happy to moralise about the sacredness of the environment, animal welfare and "natural" food production.The truth, as any psychologist will tell you, is our ideas about purity – whether they concern sex, food, or spirituality – derive from ancient (and in many cases accurate) beliefs our bodies can be desecrated by both immoral acts and contaminants.As the influential social psychologist Jonathan Haidt puts it: "Purity is not just about suppressing female sexuality, it's about any kind of ideology that tells you you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body."Religious conceptions of purity in food are well known to Jews and Muslims, and vegetarianism stretches from Buddhists and Jains all the way to Seventh Day Adventist Christians. However, the disgust felt by a vegan yoga mum about a veal parmigiana is no less real than that felt by a Salvo or Hillsonger contemplating certain "unnatural" sexual acts.Both believe your body is a temple, they just disagree on the rites conducted therein.
PDP’s Ishaku in early lead in 10 councils of TarabaThe Peoples Democratic (PDP) was in early lead in the governorship and State Assembly elections in ten of the sixteen local government councils of Taraba state on Saturday.The PDP which fielded Darius Dickson Ishaku was leading in Wukari, Donga, Karimlamido, Kurmi, Bali, Takum, Ussa, Zing, Yorro and Jalingo -the state capital.Bali local government area had voted for the President Elect Gen. Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential election. but the people however voted for the PDP in Saturday’s guber polls.Ailing Governor Danbaba Suntai left the Government House in Jalingo early morning to his village Suntai to vote for his PDP candidate (Ishaku).A heavy crowd swarmed him, some shielding tears of love and joy. They queued behind him to vote for PDP.Suntai voted in his Maman 012 polling unit of Suntai Ward.The governor did his accreditation and voting in his official car.The PDP was also leading in the House of Assembly elections.The PDP candidates in Wukari I and II constituencies were already declared winners as at press time.Mean while the elections in Kashimbilla and Malushe areas of Takum were postponed for Sunday.
It's back: Simon Cowell and Britain's Got TalentPoor old Simon Cowell. Still banging on about “changing lives” after The Voice proved that what the nation really wants is a show that does nothing of the sort.Ironically, not finding stars amid a pathetic parade of preposterous no-hopers remains Britain’s Got Talent’s strongest selling point.As the Dark Lord’s end-of-the-pier follies returned for a meaningless ninth series, who could recall last year’s winner? Anyone?I think it was another of those godawful classical opera groups that thoroughly unmodern Simon, 55, loves so much. Carcrashio or something.But who cares? Because, SuBo, Paul Potts and Diversity notwithstanding, BGT isn’t about ­propelling people to fame and fortune.No, this fun-packed programme’s principal purpose is to make us laugh by bombarding us with an 80-minute collection of crazy clips.Mission accomplished in the case of that hilarious hound Max who, instead of treating us to his amazing tricks, kept running off the stage to attack cowering Ant.Mad Max was the smash hit of the night. But not in a good way.Then we were supposed to give a damn when Cowell achieved his weird lifelong ambition of discovering a singing canine.Step forward French marvel-mutt Wendy. Who can’t sing. But can lower her jaw to order while ventriloquist Marc puts words into her mouth. Ooh la la.Quite why we had to endure stunned Simon theatrically phoning his lover to tell her the unastonishing news is a mystery.“Are you sitting down, Lauren?” he gasped. “A dog came in and sang!” David Walliams: “Well, it didn’t.” Exactly.Never mind. These are the best moments. When ITV’s annual search for an instantly forgotten nobody doesn’t take itself too ­seriously.The worst bits involve all four judges adopting their lost-in-wonder expressions as some ­mediocre wannabe proves to be halfway proficient at a daft act that will never make the mainstream.Doe-eyed duo Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon both have the impressive ability to look as if they’re close to tears.Occasionally, it almost seems genuine.After that massive Welsh choir Ysgol Glanaethwy (usual spelling) completed their passable performance you’d have thought Cowell and the standing ovation gang had just witnessed the Second Coming.Then, of course, there were the comedy losers who were sacrificed on the altar of mass entertainment.The comb player, the dummy with the vulture dummy, the cello biddies, chicken woman...Only Syco Simon believes this ritual humiliation is TV gold. In fact, it’s not very funny, horribly cruel and embarrassingly old-fashioned. Make it stop.Meanwhile, how long did it take them to edit the carefully choreographed brilliant brother/useless sister sequence?Pinky & Perky sound-alike Calum Scott wasn’t that great. Nor was his sobbing sibling Jade that bad. But what a trumped-up golden buzzer story!Pretend spontaneous drama is what he does.That and repeating “a big fat yes” every five minutes. Can’t the big fat cliché king think of any-thing else to say?And last but certainly least... WTF were those scantily clad large ladies thinking?After Ms Dixon waffled on about “empowering women”, Simon insisted: “This is one of the best acts I’ve seen.” Yeah right. Let’s face it... they were rubbish.But what the hell. At least ­Britain’s Got Talent doesn’t change lives. Better still, unlike The X Factor, it doesn’t ruin them either...
Runners are pounding the footpaths this morning as part of the Tauranga Half Marathon.Runners take part in the Tauranga Half Marathon today. Photos by: Cameron Avery.Today marks one decade of the event gracing Tauranga City's streets, bringing with it a record number of participants keen on being part of history.In the running stakes, the men's elite half marathon field looks stronger than ever with last year's top two place-getters, locals Kyle and Iain MacDonald, returning.They will be pushed hard by a number of top performers including Jono Jackson from Auckland, a NZ representative mountain runner and multiple NZ championships medal winner over 10,000m.Jackson has a best half marathon of 67 minutes – one minute-and-a-half better than the MacDonald twins.The women's favourites appear to be last year's second place-getter Jess Ruthe who should be challenged by Aucklander Kelly Parlane, a consistent performer at national level distance running events.As well as the Half Marathon distance, there are also 14km, 7km and one mile (1.7km) options for those seeking a slightly shorter challenge.The first finishers are expected to cross the line at Fergusson Park about 8.10am. Other events will run throughout the morning, with the final event – the Matua Mile – at 10.30am.
Emotional tributes have poured in for a photographer who fell whilst covering Andy Murray’s wedding rehearsal.Gordon Jack, 47, fell onto a stone in a graveyard at Dunblane Cathedral as the tennis star and his wife Kim were greeted by a media scrum.He was taken to Forth Valley Hospital, in Larbert, near Falkirk, at around 5pm yesterday but died this afternoon.Murray is reported to have looked over with concern when the accident happened, but was ushered away by security.Hours before, Mr Jack tweeted from the rehearsals.Many have taken to Twitter to pay their respects, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.MORE: Murray is married!

Birmingham City midfielder has sparked a Twitter storm by taking a swipe at the fans of his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers .The 23-year-old made the switch from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer after falling out-of-favour at the club.After the St Andrew's victory over Wolves, he couldn't resist a dig at the club he left behind.The tweet sparked quite the response on Twitter from angry Wolves fans.
VANCOUVER — As far as $100 doughnuts go, Jeanne Kaminski believes the Donutopia is a good deal.The doughnut — the humble fried confectionary of the masses — has been blinged out to the extreme at West Kelowna’s Dolicious Donuts.“Each one takes three to five hours to make. The value of the doughnut is more than $100,” said Dolicious owner Kaminski, co-creator of the lavish delicacy.The Donutopia, which rests in a sugar bowl and is decorated with 24-karat gold flakes and edible sugar “diamonds,” starts with the same simple, yet secret, 40-year-old recipe that Dolicious uses for all its doughnuts. The one difference is that the batter is made with Bling H20, a “luxury water” with a sale price that starts at $29 per 200ml bottle.“I saw it at Urban Fare and it said it was from the mountains of Tennessee. Now, I am from Tennessee so I knew that must be damn good water,” Kaminski said.Pinot Gris ice wine has been added to the cream filling, and the chocolate icing is infused with imported balsamic vinegar.“There are also gold flakes in the vinegar,” Kaminski noted.While the Donutopia may be the priciest doughnut in British Columbia, it’s a bargain compared to the £1,000 ($1,850) Dom Pérignon jelly Berliner served at a Krispy Kreme in England last year as part of a charity fundraiser during the U.K.’s national doughnut week.Kaminski’s extreme doughnut was conceived when a regular customer asked for a special doughnut to hide an engagement ring and then proposed to his fiancée inside the bakery.“It was such a happy thing that we came up with the Donutopia,” said Kaminski, who has sold just one of the $100 doughnuts, but has taken orders for several more.She said all proceeds from sales of the Donutopia are going toward the establishment of a soup kitchen in West Kelowna.
Abidjan – Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara inaugurated, on Saturday in Abidjan, an express way named after “King Mohammed VI”.The inauguration ceremony of the 4.6 kilometer expressway linking the communes of Abobo and Anyama was notably attended by Foreign Minister who was representing HM the King.The road was completed at a total cost of 13.5 million Euros and will be serving 1.8 million inhabitants of the two communes.Speaking on this occasion, the Ivorian President highlighted the longstanding ties of friendship and brotherhood between Morocco and Côte d’Ivoire.He said that naming the road after HM King Mohammed VI is a sign of appreciation and recognition to the Moroccan Sovereign for his “engagement to boost cooperation between the two countries.”In this respect, President Ouattara highlighted the importance of the projects implemented in his country with Moroccan support.Speaking on the same occasion, Mezouar said that naming the expressway after King Mohammed VI reflects “sincere friendship and brotherhood” and mirrors the willingness of the Ivorian president and HM the King to add fresh momentum to bilateral relations.Join the Conversation.

Details have emerged of how a gang pulled off an audacious jewellery heist by making off with the loot in wheelie bins.Astonishing CCTV footage shows the raiders breaking into a safe deposit box company where they spent two nights drilling through a reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault.Police issued nine still images from the CCTV cameras last night in an attempt to trace the jewel thieves.They stole an estimated £60 million in gems, cash and other valuable items, which they stuffed into wheelie bins before loading them on to the back of a Ford Transit van.The video footage was obtained from two cameras – one positioned on the street and the other by the rear fire exit through which the raiders gained entry to the premises of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company.Piecing together more than 120 hours of coverage from the two cameras, detectives have been able to build up a detailed picture of just how the raid was carried out.Det Chief Insp Paul Johnson said: “They were highly audacious, entering on two occasions over that weekend.“This footage along with other material continues to be evaluated to capture the precise movements of the suspects.”Police said that 72 of the 999 safe deposit boxes were opened. Of those, seven were empty. Police have so far contacted 42 owners while trying to reach the remaining victims.It is thought that one member of the gang may have hidden inside the building in order to let others in through a fire exit.Alternatively, they had assistance from a worker on the premises, home to a number of companies.The camera outside the fire-exit door shows the first member of the gang – a man dubbed Mr Ginger on account of his red hair – arrive at about 8.20pm on Thursday April 2, just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit company had locked up for the Easter bank holiday.The men reached the fire exit through an alley that leads from a side street in Hatton Garden, London’s famous jewellery quarter.But the alley itself is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key to get through that, too. Police have said there was no evidence of a forced entry into the Hatton Garden premises.To reach the door they would have also needed a further key to get past a metal gate that led from the rear alley on to the street.At 8.27pm, a white van pulled up in the side street around the corner from the company’s front door and the gang unloaded wheelie bins from the back of the van.It is thought the wheelie bins contained power tools including a diamond-tipped drill for boring through the 7ft concrete wall and into the basement vault.The CCTV footage suggests there were at least six members of the gang, given the nicknames Mr Ginger, Mr Montana, the Old Man, the Tall Man, the Gent and Mr Strong, based on physical features or clothing glimpsed from the footage. Mostly, the men hid beneath hats, caps and balaclavas.The footage suggests they took about 20 minutes on Thursday evening to move tools into the building, taking them down the alley and in through the rear fire exit.The gang then disabled the lift on the second floor of the communal office building and descended into the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safety deposit boxes were kept in the company’s vault.The footage shows the men remained inside the premises for about seven hours.At just after midnight on Good Friday, they triggered the intruder alarm, but police decided no response was required – a decision that is now under internal investigation.The thieves used a Hilti 350 diamond coring drill to gain access to the vaultDuring the night, the men began their attempt to break into the vault, prising open steel shutters into the company’s offices before beginning the drilling operation.The footage then shows them emerging into daylight at about 7.50am on Good Friday before getting into the white van and driving off.They returned to the crime scene just after 10.15pm on Saturday and went back to work.The footage then shows them re-emerging at the fire exit at just after 6am on Easter Sunday, struggling with a wheelie bin that is thought to be crammed full of cash and gems stolen from safe deposit boxes. Other wheelie bins were also dragged to the van.Police have refused to put a value on the stolen goods but estimates say the figure is more than £60 million.Detectives are investigating a number of specific leads, not least because only a few gangs are capable of pulling off such a crime. It is likely the men have left the country and disposed of the gems.Given how well planned the raid was, it seems likely that the men had already worked out what to do with the stolen items.One outfit thought to be on the list of targets is the Pink Panther gang, which has carried out a number of international jewel raids.The Pink Panthers were given their nickname after a diamond ring they had stolen from a London jeweller’s was found hidden in a jar of face cream. They had borrowed the idea for concealing the gem from a plotline in the 1975 Peter Sellers film The Return of the Pink Panther.A leading member of the gang – a Bosnian called Milan Popari – has been on the run since breaking out of a Swiss jail in 2013. He was the third member to be sprung from prison that year.The Pink Panthers have raided jewellers not only in Britain but also in the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Switzerland, France and Monaco.In Dubai, they used black and white Audi limousines to drive across the polished floors of an upmarket shopping mall, where they smashed the front window of a jewellery store.In Tokyo, they took just 36 seconds to steal £2 million worth of gems from a store.Police in France are also investigating whether the gang is behind a £6.4million gems heist involving two security lorries last month.20.19, Thursday, April 2 Staff at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, which provides “secure” storage for their clients’ “irreplaceable personal belongings”, lock up for the Easter weekend. The company, normally opens Monday to Friday, is not due to reopen until Tuesday morning because of the bank holiday. Hatton Garden, in which many Jewish-run diamond jewellers operate, is especially quiet because Easter coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover20.23 Four minutes later, the gang moves in. CCTV footage, made public yesterday, shows the first gang member arriving at a rear fire-exit door, reached through a narrow alley. Police later confirm there was no sign of forced entry. Dubbed Mr Ginger because of his red hair, seen beneath a black cap, the man wears latex gloves, a blue jacket and dark trousers. He is carrying a black bin bag20.27 A second CCTV camera captures a white Ford Transit van driving down Greville Street, around the corner from the front entrance to Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. It pulls up at the entrance to the side alley that offers access to a rear fire exit door into the communal building housing the safe deposit boxes. Men drag wheelie bins down the alley before the van leaves20.30 A second gang member, nicknamed the Gent because of his smart brown shoes, arrives carrying a large holdall. He has on a balaclava, a hard hat and a high-visibility jacket20.31 The gang member dubbed Mr Strong appears at the back door. He has steel supports and wears a hard hat. The supports may serve to hold in place the diamond-tipped drill used to break into the vault. Mr Strong and the Gent then carry more tools into the building20.36 A fourth man appears. Wearing a black sweatshirt bearing the words “Montana 93”, the man – Mr Montana – enters the building. He and Mr Strong drag in wheelie bins. One is thought to contain the 77lb drill used to bore through a 7ft reinforced concrete wall giving access to the basement vaults00.21, Friday April 3 An intruder alarm is set off at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company contacts the Metropolitan Police’s Central Communications Command. Police record the call but decide no response is needed – a decision now being internally investigated01.00 Mr Ginger is seen by the back door. There is no more movement above ground for almost seven hours. Inside the building, the gang disable the lift, leaving it on the second floor. They use the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safe deposit boxes are held. They force open shutter doors into the company’s offices and bore holes into the vault wall using a Hilti DD350 drill07.51 The gang resurface after a night inside the premises. Mr Ginger leaves with two purple holdalls. Mr Montana carries out two red tool boxes. Footage shows him with a shaved head and possibly an earring. A minute later, the Gent briefly appears with a red monkey wrench and bolt cutters08.02 The Gent emerges again with a black bucket of tools. Mr Montana and Mr Strong come up and put the tools in a bag08.05 CCTV gives a first glimpse of the Old Man, a grey-haired gang member, who emerges from the side doorA white van used in the Hatton Garden raid (Met Police/PA)08.12 The white transit van pulls up in the alley. The gang load it with tools and drive off. Saturday is a normal working day and the streets around Hatton Garden will be busier than on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The gang are not seen again on CCTV for 38 hoursMr Ginger is back, again wearing latex gloves and carrying a black bin bag22.32 CCTV captures a first glimpse of the Tall Man. He wears a flat cap and carries a blue Nike bag and a red tool box. The Old Man joins him. No other gang members are seen and for the next seven hours the gang drill through the vault walls, forcing open up to 70 safe deposit boxes05.46, Sunday April 5 The Tall Man, wearing an adidas top, emerges from the fire exit door carrying two red tools06.01 Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and the Old Man drag a wheelie bin outside. It is a struggle and the Old Man looks out of breath06.10 They reappear with another wheelie bin. The Tall Man makes four more trips in and out the fire exit with bags06.12 A moped pulls up on Greville Street. Moped Man walks down the alley, returns 20 minutes later and drives off06.41 The white van returns at the alley entrance and the gang start loading wheelie bins into it. Three men get into the white van, which then drives off. The heist is complete08.10, Tuesday April 7 A full 48 hours after the gang have fled, police are called to the company, following a report of a burglary. They find a “chaotic” scene. The vault is covered in debris and the floor “strewn with discarded safe deposit boxes and numerous power tools, including an angle grinder, concrete drills and crowbars”. It is thought the mob left with goods, likely to include jewels, cash and other items, worth more than £60  million

Five Houthis and two local fighters died, residents said.Locals said Houthi forces were shelling civilian areas and trying to push into the Tawahi district, one of the only areas where they have no presence and home to a presidential palace and the city's military port.While the Houthis deny getting help from Shi'ite Iran and say their armed campaign is designed to stamp out corruption and Sunni al Qaeda militants, Saudi Arabia and its allies describe them as an Iranian-backed threat to regional security.The United Nations says the conflict, in which the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in northern Yemen in September, has killed 600 people, wounded 2,200 and displaced 100,000 others.Saudi Arabia's Defence Ministry statement said more than 500 Houthis had also been killed in fighting on Yemen's border with the kingdom since the conflict began, but it did not say how it arrived at that figure.
A transplant survivor has honoured a promise to his bone marrow donor almost one quarter of a century later – by inviting his lifesaver to watch him walk his daughter down the aisle.Sales manager, Ian Brown, 59, from Morpeth in Northumberland, saved Rick Haines’ life by donating bone marrow to him in 1991.Thanks to the donation, Mr Haines will be able to see his daughter Marissa, now 27, get married next month.Mr Brown said: “Before his bone marrow transplant, Rick had little chance of survival and his greatest sorrow was that he would never have the opportunity to walk his little girl – who was four at the time - down the aisle.“He asked me many years ago as to how he could ever repay me for donating the bone marrow that saved his life, and my answer was to let me see that very thing happen.”Next month Mr Brown and his wife will attend the wedding in the United States as very special guests.He joined the Anthony Nolan register in the late 1980s when his baby son Michael - now 33 - was being treated for cancer.A few years later, in 1991, he received a call to tell him that he was a match for a patient in the USA who was in desperate need of a transplant.Mr Brown agreed to donate and travelled to the Harley Street Clinic in London to make the lifesaving donation.He gave his bone marrow on the morning of May 17, 1991, and it was immediately picked up by a courier who flew over to the USA on Concorde, on a journey of more than 3,500 miles, which allowed the patient to have his transplant that evening.Mr Brown said: “It was so rewarding – after making the donation, I went round with a huge smile on my face for six months.”Following the donation, the sales manager learned that his bone marrow had gone to a 44-year-old man called Rick Haines who lived in Delaware and who was suffering from aplastic anaemia.Afterwards, Mr Haines, an engineer in the motor industry, contacted Mr Brown to thank him.Mr Haines, now 68, explained that he had feared he would not live to see his young daughter walk down the aisle, and a deal was struck.• Donor organs from cancer patients should be transplanted despite risks• People who agree to donate their organs could be given NHS priorityThe men met for the first time in 1996 when the Browns flew out to America, and have since had family holidays together.Now, Mr Brown will fly to Pennsylvania to see Mr Haines' daughter Marissa marry her fiancé Dustin on May 9.The sales manager, who was widowed in 2011, will be marrying his partner, Lorraine Scott, in Durham the week before so will be attending the wedding as part of their honeymoon.Mr Brown said: “It is like a completion of the story. I am quite an emotional person and I am sure it will be an amazing moment to see Rick walk down the aisle with Marissa after all of these years.”Around 2,000 people in the UK need a bone marrow transplant from a stranger each year, often as a result of blood cancers such as leukaemia, and other disorders which affect the blood.Around one quarter of people have the same tissue type as a sibling, but the majority of patients need a donation from a stranger.Most donations take place via a four-hour outpatient appointment, with a machine withdrawing blood from one arm, separating the stem cells, and returning the blood through the other arm.In 10 per cent of cases the stem cells are taken from the bone marrow in the hip; this is done under general anaesthetic.The difficulty is finding a match: only one in 1,200 people who join the register get asked to donate, rising to one in 300 for young men.Last year a young bride-to-be launched a desperate appeal to find her fiancé a life-saving stem cell donor in just 60 days as he battled leukaemia, and found a match after seeing her campaign go viral on social media.Kate Robertson launched the Shake4mike appeal in her race against the clock to source a donor for Mike Brandon.The pair had just two months to find a donor after being told Mr Brandon must undergo a transplant as soon as he had finished his next course of chemotherapy.Anthony Nolan, the world’s first bone marrow register, has been matching donors to patients for more than four decades.The charity is urgently seeking more young men aged 16-30 to sign up, as they are most likely to be chosen to donate but make up just 15 per cent of the register.In 2013 a 17-year-old sixth former became the youngest ever donor to register on their list.Currently, only 60 per cent of transplant recipients receive the best possible match, dropping to just 21 per cent among those of a black, Asian or ethnic minority background, the charity’s figures show.If you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health, you can join the Anthony Nolan register here.
When Zara Phillips found husband Mike Tindall had bought a quarter share in racehorse Monbeg Dude at an auction in 2010 she reportedly called him an "idiot".The horse cost former England rugby international Tindall and three friends £12,000 but turned out to be a poor jumper of fences.However, Ms Phillips, daughter of the Princess Royal and an Olympic equestrian competitor, changed her mind after spending some time training the horse. And Tindall’s luck was in as the horse romped home in third place at the Grand National , netting £105,500 in prize money.Winning the Grand National is a feat which neither the Queen nor the late Queen Mother, both successful racing horse owners, have achieved.The only occasion on which a Royal has won the National was back in 1900 when the Prince of Wales's horse, Ambush II was victorious.A number of other famous names have owned the National winner including comedian Freddie Starr (Miinnehoma, 1994) and Anne, the Duchess of Westminster, (Last Suspect, 1985).The National also proved to be a historic day for jockey Leighton Aspell who rode Pineau de Re to victory last year.Aspell achieved a remarkable back to back victory, winning the world-famous race for a second year in a row on Many Clouds and landing the prize money of £561,300.The 38-year-old, who once retired from the saddle, held off Saint Are by a length and three-quarters.Aspell said after the race: “That was awesome. Many Clouds is a tired boy, he gave his all like he always does but what a wonderful ride round. It was all guts.”Much loved veteran jockey Tony McCoy came in fifth on Shutthefrontdoor in his final National, which was watched by an estimated nine million viewers in the UK and 600 million worldwide.While McCoy had his hopes of victory dashed, bookmakers were left smiling as they dodged an estimated £60 million payout if he’d won.Shutthefrontdoor ‘s trainer Jonjo O'Neill said: "He ran a blinder. He did everything right, he was following the right horses but unfortunately he wasn't good enough on the day and maybe he didn't get the trip."It's good news, at least I've got AP (McCoy) for a couple more weeks (before retirement)."Overall, up to £165 million worth of bets were estimated to have been placed on the Grand National. Bookmaker William Hill said it would be paying out £13 million to the 200,000 lucky punters who backed Many Clouds, which returned at odds of 25/1.Aspell’s victory marked the first time that a jockey had won two Nationals in a row since Brian Fletcher triumphed on the legendary Red Rum in 1973 and 1974.The last time a jockey landed in first place two years in a row on different horses was Bryan Marshall who won on Early Mist in 1953 and Quare Times in 1955.No jockey has ridden the Grand National winner three years in a row and William Hill promptly offered odds of 14/1 that Aspell does it again next year.Aspell had retired from racing at just 31 years of age in 2007, but changed his mind two years later. He’s not the oldest jockey ever to win the race – that was Dick Saunders at 48, when he partnered Grittar to victory in 1982.It was a third Grand National win for Many Clouds’ owner, Trevor Hemmings, who said: "Seriously, it was incredible. You come to the National and you dream that you win it."When a third comes along, that is something special. It is a wonderful, wonderful feeling."For years and years this race has captured my heart. What a wonderful feeling, you can't express it."Thank you [trainer] Oliver Sherwood, thank you Leighton and all the staff, and, of course, Aintree."Mr Sherwood said after the win: "I can't believe it. I thought it was a year too early and that Many Clouds might have gone over the top. What do I know about horses?"It is only the third time in history that an owner has won the Grand National three times.The first was James Machell who triumphed in 1873 with Disturbance, 1874 with Reugny and in 1876 with Regal.The second was Noel Le Mare with Red Rum in 1973, 1974 and 1977.Many Clouds was described as "wobbly" after the race and taken away to cool down but quickly recovered.All 39 horses were said to be fine following the tough race despite a number of falls and only 19 horses finishing, according to Channel Four which broadcast the race.There were protests by animal rights activists prior to the race, including from Animal Aid, a campaign group that wants to see the National abolished.A protester scaled the Gift Horse statue in Trafalgar Square in London on behalf of Animal Aid, and wrapped it in a banner reading “Horse racing: you bet, they die.”The director of Animal Aid, Andrew Tyler, said the daring protest, at 6am, aimed to draw attention to the dangers faced by horses racing in the National.“The green banner is representative of the green screens behind which race horses are shot on racecourses,” said Mr Tyler. “The statue, by Hans Hacke, was chosen because the skeletal sculpture reminds us of the horses who are victims of the racing industry.”Green screens were placed around one faller, Balthazar King. The horse survived and was reported to have been transported to a veterinary hospital with suspected broken ribs.Mr Tyler said: "Watching the race I was feeling so distressed. Anyone who loves and cares for horses is going to be deeply distressed by watching that. It's a wicked perverse spectacle that horses should never have to be subjected to. Balthazar King got up by pure good fortune, which was good news."
Like many other girls, all Lisa Gordon used to hope for was to marry a smart-looking guy who was dependable and had a steady job.When she met Keith it seemed her quest for a ­husband was over.He was ideal – older then her, ­sensible and an ­office worker who had a ­decent dress sense – the ­gentleman she was waiting for.But 14 years after they tied the knot she struggles to recognise the man she fell in love with. And she can barely stand the sight of him.Because in the past seven years Keith, 59, has become transformed from Mr Average to one of the most ­tattooed men in the country – ­covered in body art from head to toe.People stare at him whenever he goes out, which is tough for Lisa.Sensible: Keith and Lisa on their wedding day in 2002She told the Sunday People: “I would never have ­married him if he looked the way he does now. I always wanted a man who appears ­respectable and who the children can look up to.“Instead I look at him and I think, ‘What have I married?’“If I could get a magic wand I would wave it and take all the tattoos off. Sometimes I look at his face and try to remember what it used to be like when we met.”Lisa admits she treasures the ­moments when they are together with the lights out.“When we’re lying in bed in the dark I don’t see his tattoos.“I can touch his face and ­remember what he used to look like.“I feel like I’m sleeping with a monster in my bed.”Obsessed: Keith says his tattoos help him cope with OCDFor Keith, an admin worker, his wife’s refusal to ­accept the way he looks is hard to take. He said: “I don’t give a damn about what ­anyone else thinks about me.“The only thing that does upset me is Lisa not accepting my tattoos. It makes me sad.“She’s my wife and I do feel like she should support me. I’ve got enough haters.”He has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder for more than 40 years and claims his tattoos have helped him cope with it.Long-suffering Lisa has stuck by her man because she can see the ­difference the tattoos have made to his everyday life.She said: “I don’t like them but I know they make him ­happy. Before, he was depressed and suffered with OCD. He used to make me mad ­doing OCD stuff. Now he’s a lot calmer and happier.“Perhaps I shouldn’t care, because it makes me sound shallow.“But I just can’t bring myself to like the way they look.”Annoyed: Lisa can't come to terms with Keith's new lookLisa, originally from the Philippines, can’t help looking back and missing the man she met during her lunch break from a cleaning job in London’s upper-crust Sloane Square in 2001.She said: “I’d had a bad ­relationship. I realised I ­needed someone different – a bit more ­mature, someone older, who could look after me.“Keith was totally different from how he is now. He was wearing a shirt and trousers. He looked like a nice, simple guy.”Lisa was 29 and Keith 46 but ­despite the 16-year age difference she was smitten.A month after they started dating, Lisa told Keith about her one-year-old daughter Diana Rose back home in the Philippines.“He was so supportive and I knew I could depend on him.”And when they married in July 2002 Lisa was five months pregnant with their first child together, Jamie-Lee, now 11.She said: “It’s so strange when I look at the wedding photos. It’s like I married a different person.“The personality isn’t different, it’s the same. He’s always been a nice, lovely caring guy who has tried to make me happy.”The couple, who live in Romford, East London, ­settled into family life and had two more kids, Ricky, nine and Jennifer, six. All four children's names and ­birthdays are tattooed on Keith’s ­fingers.Lisa said: “Having ­children was an obsession for him. He wanted to start a family. I think it was linked to OCD.”Recalling the ­background to his ­habit, Lisa said: “Keith was ­always into heavy metal but he didn’t look like someone who was. He went to work looking smart in a suit and tie. When he played his music at home I just went to a ­different part of the house.“He always had the rock T-shirts but he didn’t really wear them. They stayed in the drawer.” But after their youngest child Jennifer was born in 2008, Keith’s rock side ­came to the fore.He decided to get a tattoo – a skull on his shoulder.It was the ­beginning of the end for his straight-laced ­image as he ­became hooked on his inking sessions. Lisa said: “When he told me he wanted it I was shocked and angry. I just didn’t like them.“I worried about what my family would think.”But undeterred, Keith has gone on to spend £15,000 on body art in the last seven years. Only his ribs and stomach remain to be covered and his hobby has been costing an average of £130 a month.Lisa said: “Now I think it was all part of his obsessive ­behaviour. He’d had ­children and after that he needed something new to focus on.“When he had his sleeves done it was sort of OK. People didn’t react to that. But when he got his face done I would go out and feel embarrassed.”What ­puzzled Lisa even more was that Keith had tattoos as a ­teenager – on both arms. But he had them removed when he was 20 as his OCD kicked in. Keith said: “It was a mental health ­issue. I had to have them removed on the NHS and for years I couldn’t stand to even see a tattoo.”Decades later, and on medication for depression, his impulse to have tattoos roared back.Today it is not all agony for his wife. As Keith’s tattoos have got him more attention, she admits to feeling the ­occasional ­glimmer of pride. Lisa said: “I used to be embarrassed when we went out but now I ­support him.“If someone on a bus says, ‘Look at him,’ I will make it clear we are ­together. I don’t hide. I’ve realised that I need to be his wife and be a ­supportive shoulder.”There are even some benefits.Family guy: Keith with Lisa and their childrenLisa said: “At least he doesn’t look old. Before, he did look older but now he looks younger. My friends can’t believe he’s almost 60. They think he’s 30 or 40.”“Sometimes Keith will point to an old guy with grey hair and say, ‘Do you want me to look like him?’“That’s the only time I think he maybe looks better.”Despite her dislike of his tattoos, the couple are still very much in love.Keith said: “We’re totally ­incompatible but it works. We don’t like anything the same. I like heavy metal but she likes Engelbert Humperdinck.”And although she thinks his tattoos are ugly – Lisa still fancies Keith.She laughed as she said: “Sometimes I don’t understand myself why I’ve stayed... when you look at what I ­married and what he looks like now.“But we’ve been together 14 years and we do love each other. He only looks like a lunatic, but he’s not.“He’s attractive to me because he’s my husband.“He may be a monster but he’s my monster.”
VANCOUVER - Most of the toxic bunker fuel that spilled into the waters of Vancouver's scenic English Bay has been cleaned up, and crews have shifted their focus to clearing the shoreline, officials say.Coast Guard assistant commissioner Roger Girouard said a Transport Canada flyover at sunset Friday saw only about six litres left in the water and most of it likely evaporated overnight.About 2,700 litres of the black oil spilled on Wednesday from the MV Marathassa, a Japanese-made ship on its maiden voyage to pick up grain from Vancouver.The location of the leak has now been identified as the hull outlet, and officials believe the brand new ship built to the latest standards suffered a malfunction.Divers have been out each day to ensure that no further pollution has been coming from the vessel, and marine safety inspectors have boarded the ship daily, said Yvette Myers of Transport Canada.But divers are not testing the water and it is not known if any fuel has sunk to the bottom of the bay."That a small amount of oil might accumulate around some flotsam, a piece of wood, or something weighted, is certainly within the range of possibility, but we don't expect any significant volumes to have gone down to the ocean floor, Girouard said.He added work will continue for several days to clean up the beaches, where he says soiling is relatively minor despite a couple of spots where oil coated some rocks.Crews have visited and assessed several spots on the shoreline, including the south shore of English Bay near Stanley Park, as well as Sandy Cove, the hardest-hit area in West Vancouver.No marine mammals in distress have been found, but several oiled birds have been captured and taken to refuge. Girouard said the "small number" of affected birds is proof of the coast guard's "successful" response.The coast guard has faced harsh criticism for its response to Wednesday's spill, including from British Columbia premier Christy Clark and Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, who called it "totally inadequate."While the initial report of pollution in the water came in at 5 p.m., the coast guard did not have an oil-absorbing boom in place until midnight and did not alert the city until 6 a.m. Thursday.Environmental groups and concerned residents gathered across the province on Saturday to call on Clark to pull out of the National Energy Board review process of Kinder Morgan's proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.The expansion would bring more tankers, some carrying diluted bitumen, to B.C.'s coast. One environmentalist at English Bay called the recent spill an "absolute wake-up call.""The handling of that has been really concerning, that we aren't prepared to deal with a relatively small spill of bunker fuel," said Alexandra Woodsworth of the Georgia Strait Alliance."If we can't deal with that, how can we deal with a massive spill of diluted bitumen?"Kinder Morgan sent a statement calling the spill an "unfortunate situation" it is watching closely but said it is unrelated to Trans Mountain.
A convicted murderer who murdered and dismembered his teenage victim has had boiling hot water thrown over him in an apparent revenge attack in a Scottish prison.William Beggs, 54, known as the Limbs in the Loch murderer, was described by police at the time of his conviction in 2001 as a 'serial killer in the making'.Beggs is serving a life sentence in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1999.The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond and his head was dumped in the sea off the Ayrshire coast.Beggs screamed in pain as boiling water was thrown over his face and hands in the cell attack, the Scottish Daily Record reported yesterday.The alleged attacker was due for release this year and has since been moved to Shotts Prison.He reportedly told friends he was taking revenge after Beggs attacked him soon after he arrived at the prison.It is understood Beggs was treated for burns in the prison's infirmary but did not need to attend hospital.Supermarket worker Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock.In 2001 a jury found Beggs took the teenager to his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault.He then murdered him and cut up his body.Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands.After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial.After the High Court jury delivered their majority verdict and found him guilty it was revealed Beggs was once cleared of a similar murder by appeal court judges on a technicality.Beggs was jailed in 1987 at Teeside Crown Court for murdering a barman he met in a gay nightclub by slashing his throat, only to have the conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal, the BBC reported at the time.The court also learned that at the same trial Beggs was convicted of two charges of wounding and sentenced to four months for each.He was also jailed for six years in 1991 for slashing the leg of a man who escaped by jumping through a glass window.Beggs has repeatedly tried and failed to have his conviction overturned at the Supreme Court.
Yasiel Puig, who appears to be in an early-season slump, will be on the bench Saturday when the Dodgers take on the Arizona Diamondbacks in the second game of a three-game series at Chase Field.In the Dodgers’ first four games, Puig was two for 17 with six strikeouts.Puig’s second hit of the season came Friday night in the 10th inning of the Dodgers’ 4-3 defeat to the Diamondbacks.Following the game, Manager Don Mattingly said, “I think Yas looks a little frustrated, honestly. More than anything, probably just trying too hard to get a hit.”Andre Ethier will start in right field in place of Puig.Justin Turner also will make his first start of the season, as he will be at third base instead of Juan Uribe.With Clayton Kershaw on the mound, A.J. Ellis will catch.
Nick Suzuki and Isaac Ratcliffe have been friends for nine years.They have grown up two minutes away from each other in Byron.On Saturday, the Jr. Knights teammates were picked back-to-back in the OHL draft -- Suzuki 14th overall to Owen Sound and Ratcliffe 15th to Guelph, the Midwest division rivals who just happened to meet in the first round of this year's playoffs."We didn't have a battle going on or anything (about which one of them would be selected first)," said Ratcliffe, the 6-foot-5, 183-pound winger heading to Storm City. "We're just happy for one another. We really developed a lot of chemistry and it's going to be hard not having a guy like that with me (in Guelph)."But I'm sure we'll develop a lot of new good friendships and chemistry with other players over the next few years."London loomed at pick No. 17. The Knights took big defenceman Evan Bouchard, who scored 18 goals in 35 games this season with the Oakville Rangers. He and Victor Mete could have an offensive field day together next year.GM Basil McRae never got a crack at the two star hometown boys."I'm excited to be part of Owen Sound," said Suzuki, the skilled centre who was on the Attack's radar enough to go to the Bayshore last month to watch a game. "It would be great to play in London, but we're in the same division so we'll be playing the Knights a lot."It should be fun."Suzuki and Ratcliffe were vital parts of Ontario's Canada Winter Games gold medal in Prince George, B.C., this year. They capped their important minor midget campaign with a stirring run to the OHL Cup semifinal round."First, going to B.C. to play with that great group of guys was amazing," Ratcliffe said, "and at the OHL Cup, we really turned some heads and found a few shocked faces in the crowd. After our team did that, everyone was excited to see where they would go (in the draft)."Ilderton's Shane Bulitka was the top Elgin-Middlesex Chief, landing in Sudbury in the second round (28th overall). Aidan Hughes, the huge Jr. Knights stopper who had a great combine, went 34th overall to Sarnia.He was the second goaltender picked in this draft.Now, all of the 15- and 16-year-olds are back to square one again."The draft is so unpredictable," Ratcliffe said. "I wasn't expected too much and wanted to come in with a clear mind. It's up to me to go out, play next year and show myself well."I'm really excited to start my journey.The Knights, who need their top picks to show up after failing to attract Americans Zach Werenski and Max Jones the past two years, didn't get the two close buddies, but they grabbed their share of local talent.London picked Max Vinogradov, a super scorer, along with centre Alex Turko and defencemen Jordan Di Cicco in the first 10 rounds.1.

MONTE CARLO (MONACO) - While Andy Murray celebrates his weekend marriage, the rest of the ATP elite are girding for battle on the clay, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal leading the field as the Monte Carlo Masters which begins on Sunday.Murray, who moved back to third in the world after reaching the Miami final last weekend against on-form number one Djokovic, will delay the start of his clay campaign as he misses the European opening.Djokovic is riding a massive wave of form, with the Serb already winning the Australian Open and completing an historic third trophy double at Indian Wells and Miami.With his newborn son now on the road with the family and his tennis firing perfectly, the 27-year-old is totally content."It's just the beginning, I don't want to predict anything. I don't want to put some additional unnecessary pressure on myself," the Monte Carlo-based player said as the clay start drew closer."There is already a lot of expectations of course. Everywhere I go I have to deal with it."I could not ask for a better start of the season winning three big titles. Hopefully I'm able to use this for the clay courts."That's extremely important for me obviously leading up to French (the only Grand Slam he has never won).I feel good about myself right now on the court, and just going to take it slowly, one tournament at a time."Last year's finalist Federer is back after skipping Miami as a strategic move and getting in a training block at home with Austrian Dominic Thiem.Federer was beaten a year ago in the championship match by compatriot Stan Wawrinka, who won the title but has failed to solidify himself as a consistent top five contender.The Swiss takes the seventh seeding at the seaside Country Club.A major question mark has to hang over eight-time winner Rafael Nadal, the third seed who has not lifted the title here since 2012. Since winning his ninth Roland Garros ten months ago, the Spaniard’s only title was a small South American clay event in February.Nadal, his battered body now a constant issue, is trying to bounce back after poor hardcourt showings in the US, exiting in the Indian Wells quarters and third round in Miami.The 28-year-old has been back on the familiar clay at home in Mallorca and needs a deep run in the principality to help cement his fragile confidence.Canadian Milos Raonic takes the fourth seeding in a draw where the top eight seeds have byes.The big server is trailed by number five Spaniard David Ferrer, Czech Tomas Berdych on sixth seeding, with 2014 Grand Slam winners Wawrinka and Marin Cilic closing out the elite grouping.Missing will be Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, whose right wrist surgery comeback in Miami lasted for only one losing match. Japan's fourth-ranked Kei Nishikori is also not present.Frenchman Richard Gasquet is missing as he battles more back problems. But the French will have Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon in the mix.Americans have managed to actually cross the Atlantic, though the chances of hardcourters John Isner and Sam Querrey are minimal at best.Australian Bernard Tomic is back after wisdom teeth work while compatriot Nick Kyrgios is delaying his injury return until Barcelona next week.
PANAMA CITY - US President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro held unprecedented face-to-face talks in Panama on Saturday, ditching decades of Cold War-era antagonism in a historic effort to restore diplomatic ties.In the first substantive talks between leaders of both nations since 1956, Obama thanked Castro for his "spirit of openness," while the communist leader stressed that the negotiations will require patience.The talks were the climax of their surprise announcement on December 17 that, after 18 months of secret negotiations, they would seek to normalize relations between their two nations."This is obviously a historic meeting," said Obama, who spoke first after they sat down for their talks on the sidelines of the 35-nation Summit of the Americas.Obama declared that, after 50 years of policies that had not worked, "it was time for us to try something new."‎"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future," he said.After Obama spoke, the two men stood up and shook hands.Saying he agreed with everything Obama said, Castro said the two government can still have differences but "with respect of the ideas of the others.""We are willing to discuss everything but we need to be patient, very patient," he said.The two leaders had already made conciliator speeches moments earlier during the summit, sitting in an oval table with some 30 other regional leaders.US-Cuban tensions have vexed Washington's relations with the region for decades."This shift in US policy represents a turning point for our entire region," Obama said.As the US leader looked on, Castro declared: "President Obama is an honest man."But both leaders acknowledged that the two countries, as they negotiate to restore diplomatic relations that broke off in 1961, will continue to have disagreements.Obama cited the human rights situation in Cuba, while Castro renewed calls for the US Congress to lift a decades-old embargo."I think it's no secret, President Castro I'm sure would agree, that there will continue to be significant differences between our two countries," Obama said.It was Cuba's first time participating at the 21-year-old summit.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos summed up the mood, saying "an old obstacle in relations between Latin America and North America is being removed."US and Cuba diplomats have held negotiations to restore embassies since January.Cuba has demanded to be removed from a US list of state sponsors of terrorism before embassies can reopen, noting that this has blocked the country's access to bank credit.Castro told the summit that Obama was taking a "positive step" by reviewing his country's inclusion on the list.The White House indicated that Obama was not yet ready to decide whether to remove Havana from the blacklist, but that it could not rule out an announcement in Panama.Obama has urged the US Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba, which was imposed in 1962, barring most trade with the island as well as tourism.But as Obama sought to turn the page on Cold War-era tensions, US tensions with Venezuela also took the stage.Obama left the room to head to a bilateral meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro spoke to criticize him."I respect you, but I don't trust you, President Obama," Maduro said.He urged Obama to lift sanctions against Venezuelan officials accused of committing human rights abuses. The order has particularly irritated Maduro because it calls Caracas a US national security threat."I am willing to talk with President Obama about this issue with respect and sincerity whenever he wants," Maduro said.Maduro said he has publicly and privately sought to speak with Obama ever since the Venezuelan leader was elected two years ago, but his US counterpart "never answered the messages that I sent him."The White House sought to ease tensions ahead of the summit, saying it did not really believe that Venezuela posed a national security threat."The response has been forceful, rejecting the executive order and demanding its removal," Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa said."Our people will never again accept tutelage, meddling and intervention."
WOW FACTOR: Thomas and Emily McKenzie in an F-111 cockpit at Caloundra Airport during the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day. More photos on Page 42.THOMAS and Emily McKenzie were over the moon to have the chance to sit in an F-111 cockpit at the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day at Caloundra yesterday."It was very squishy, but it was pretty cool looking at all the controls," Thomas said."I really enjoyed looking at all the planes, especially the F-111."The engines were pretty good too."READ MORE OF THE LATEST SUNSHINE COAST NEWSSeveral hundred people attended the event, which featured a jumping castle, a demonstration by the Eudlo Fire Brigade, Second World War jeep rides, as well as more than 65 restored aircraft on display.Dad Stuart McKenzie was as excited as his children to be at the show."It's always nice for kids to look at the planes, and for me as well," he said."It's a fantastic place, even if you're not interested in planes."It brings back lots of memories being here."The highlight of the event was when eight engines and planes were fired up at once.QAM president Cameron Elmes said the day was a chance to show off the engines in action.He said volunteers had been overwhelmed with the amount of community support."It's been fantastic," he said."We've been trying to make it a more family-centric event."If you want a history of aviation, this is the place to be - hopefully we can build an interest in aviation too."QAM marketing and promotions manager Geoff Smith said the vibe at the event had been overwhelmingly positive."It's a very happy day," he said.He thanked the 90 volunteers who helped out at the centre.
The killing of Walter Scott by a police officer in South Carolina was motivated by "overt racism", mourners at his funeral have heard.Hundreds of people attended the service at the Ministries Christian Centre in North Charleston to remember the father-of-four, who was shot last week.Officer Michael Slager was charged with his murder, after a video of the shooting emerged.Reverend George Hamilton said Mr Slager was a disgrace to the police force.He told mourners: "We will not indict the entire law enforcement community for the act of one racist."Mr Scott's coffin was draped with an American flag and flanked by members of his family as it entered the church on Saturday.Chairs were placed outside to accommodate the large number of people who turned out for the service.The 50-year-old was shot several times as he ran away from Mr Slager, who had initially reprimanded him for a broken rear light on his car.His relatives said Mr Scott probably fled from the officer out of fear of being jailed over missed child support payments.The shooting occurred as heightened scrutiny is being placed on police officer shootings, particularly those that involve white officers and unarmed black suspects.Tyrone Johnson, who went to school with Mr Scott, described him as a friendly person, who "never met an enemy"."There are a lot of people out here, just paying their respects to him and his legacy," he added.Mr Slager has been held without bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder.
DARREN Bent admitted Derby County "weren't at the races" against Brentford - but believes his last-gasp equaliser could yet prove key in their promotion bid. Bent struck in the second minute of stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw for the Rams at the iPro Stadium on Saturday. Brentford had led for much of the match and missed several chances to kill the game off - and leapfrog their opponents in the Championship table. As it is, Derby remain fifth, a point ahead of the Bees, who are just outside the play-off zone with four games to go. While the Rams' automatic promotion hopes continue to fade, they remain in contention for a top-six finish. "We didn't play well but we've managed to nick a point," said Bent. "That point could be massive come the end of the season. "We weren't at the races but we should take confidence from the fact that we stayed in it right to the end and showed great character. "We know full well we weren't at our best but you've got to give Brentford credit, too. "They dominated large periods of the game and made it difficult for us. "If you look at the game, in the grand scheme of things, it's a fantastic result, because we could easily have come away with nothing."Follow us on Facebook and Twitter

Praise: Strauss has hailed Pietersen as the best player he's ever played withAndrew Strauss has put any personal issues with Kevin Pietersen to one side and revealed KP is the best cricketer he's ever played with.The former England pair didn't share a good relationship during their time in the international setup and KP infamously criticised his captain via text messages to South African players in 2012.Pietersen hasn't played for England since January 2014 but Strauss reckons, out of all the talented players he played with, that KP is the best."In terms of being able to do things that other cricketers couldn’t, in the England side while I was involved he [Pietersen] was the one guy that stood out for me," revealed Strauss on the Lord's podcast.However, despite lauding Pietersen for his ability, Strauss reckons the ECB will be taking a step backwards if they give him an international recall."It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation," added Strauss."That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than actually him playing or not, it's become that big."The ECB and England’s team efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far, [but] by winning, that will allow them to move forward."If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after this Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side."You’re building to the next Ashes in two and half years time and the World Cup in 2019."I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time."
Gunmen have killed 20 construction workers in Pakistan's restive south-western province of Baluchistan.The men were shot at point blank range after identifying where they were from, officials said today.The area is plagued by violence, with separatists seeking greater control over the province's rich oil, gas and mineral resources.Gunmen have previously targeted outsiders seen as settlers."Armed gunmen stormed the camp of labourers in Gokh Don area of Baluchistan late Friday night and killed 20 labourers," senior police official Tariq Khilji told AFP news agency.He said those killed were all from outside the province, 16 of them from Punjab and four from Sindh province.The incident, which occurred around 1,050km southwest of Quetta, was confirmed by Akbar Hussain Durrani, a senior administration official in the province."The labourers were working on construction of a small local bridge," he said.Mr Hussain said some of the workers reported being woken from their sleep by the sound of gunshots and screams."They had lined them up and shot them at point blank range after identifying their identity," he said.He said paramilitary troops were guarding the workers but fled when confronted by a large number of armed attackers.Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident but Mr Hussain said insurgents have attacked non-Baluch settlers in the area in the past.Human rights groups have long accused Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies of serious abuses in Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest but least populous province.The security services deny the allegations and say they are battling a fierce rebellion in the province.
A gorse fire that was threatening thousands of acres of Killarney National Park has been extinguished.The fire at the foot of Mangerton Mountain had been burning since Thursday.The fire had spread over several kilometres due to the dry conditions.A spokesperson for Kerry Fire and Rescue told RTÉ News the fire was extinguished at 9.30pm last night.Around 20 firefighters deployed from Killarney and nearby towns Kenmare and Castleisland had been fighting the gorse fire.An air corps helicopter also assisted in fighting the fire, which is believed to be one of the largest to ever take hold inside the National Park.Hundreds of trees have been scorched by the fire and there has also been major loss, temporarily, of important habitats, according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.In a statement, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys said she expects to receive a detailed report on the damage caused to the woodlands and wildlife from the NPWS next week.

Steve Bruce remains confident that Hull can stave off relegation, despite leaving Southampton off the back of an all too familiar defeat.Last season's run to the FA Cup final and Premier League safety is a distant memory for City fans as their side slide worryingly close to a Championship return.The latest blow came at St Mary's, where James Ward-Prowse and Graziano Pelle ended long goal droughts as Southampton withstood an impressive start from Hull to secure a 2-0 win.Sone Aluko proved a nuisance and Jake Livermore forced Kelvin Davis into a save early in the second half, yet the inability to capitalise saw the match play out in a way Bruce has unfortunately become accustomed to."Well, we expected them to be better," the Tigers boss said of Southampton."Livermore has hit a screaming shot from 18 yards where the goalkeeper, to be fair to Kelvin, has made terrific save and then we have given a poor goal away, which is not like us."When in the ascendency like we were, you have to score, you have to take advantage of that situation."Apart from the first half against Swansea, against Chelsea the week before that and today we've been in the game and given ourselves a chance."If we take one of them chances, I am still convinced we have enough to stay in this division but obviously we're in the fight like everybody else."Despite still hovering just above the bottom three, Hull are many people's favourites to get sucked into the relegation zone due to their unenviable last six fixtures.Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all come to the KC Stadium before the season is out, while trips to fellow strugglers Burnley and revitalised Crystal Palace await."Listen, Sunderland today would be thinking they've got chance against Crystal Palace at home and get beat by four," Bruce said."We've got four games out of six at home and we have to win a couple of them, in my opinion, and might have to do a bit more than that."We've certainly got an opportunity no matter who we play against as we're at home."Going to Southampton, Swansea, Leicester, they're all not easy. That's why we're in the position we are in."We are finding it difficult but I'm still convinced we can beat three others. It'll be difficult but I still remain positive we can do it."Bruce had no complaints about the decision to award a penalty against son Alex, but was irritated that Pelle's forearm on him only warranted a yellow card.That decision allowed the Italy international to eventually end his long wait for a Premier League goal and wrap up the win, much to the delight of Saints manager Ronald Koeman."The last goal was in December," he said. "It's a long time ago."It wasn't a discussion, it wasn't a question how he is playing because he showed his qualities to be a strong target man, but if you are a striker you like to score and you need to score and it will help him a lot the second goal."The opener here came from England Under-21s midfielder Ward-Prowse, with the converted penalty representing his first-ever league goal.It was an impressive finish from the 20-year-old substitute and an opportunity Sadio Mane attempted to deny him, claiming the ball only to see it wrestled away from him."I was surprised because everybody knows if Proswey is on the pitch and normally Dusan (Tadic) and they are the first and the second choice to take the penalty," Koeman said."I had to shout to Jose (Fonte) to change that because it looks that Sadio was taking the penalty and Prowsey accepted that."I don't understand that because he knows the first choice. It was a difficult situation, a difficult situation, but I had to do it."That's the problem about Mane. The rules in the team are more important and nothing else."
PANAMA CITY - President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro sat down together Saturday in the first formal meeting of the two country's leaders in a half-century, pledging to reach for the kind of peaceful relationship that has eluded their nations for generations.In a small conference room in a Panama City convention centre, the two sat side by side in a bid to inject fresh momentum into their months-old effort to restore diplomatic ties. Reflecting on the historic nature of the meeting, Obama said he felt it was time to try something new and to engage with both Cuba's government and its people."What we have both concluded is that we can disagree with a spirit of respect and civility," Obama said. "And over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries."Castro, for his part, said he agreed with everything Obama had said — a stunning statement in and of itself for the Cuban leader. But he added the caveat that they had "agreed to disagee" at times. Castro said he had told the Americans that Cuba was willing to discuss issues such as human rights and freedom of the press, maintaining that "everything can be on the table.""We are disposed to talk about everything — with patience," Castro said in Spanish. "Some things we will agree with, and others we won't."And nothing is static, he added, noting that disagreements today could turn into areas of agreement tomorrow. "The pace of life at the present moment in the world — it's very fast."Not since 1958 have a U.S. and Cuban leader convened a substantial meeting. Dwight Eisenhower and Fulgencio Batista met that year, and the following year, former Cuban President Fidel Castro met with Richard Nixon, who was vice-president at the time.But relations quickly entered into a deep freeze amid the Cold War, and the U.S. spent decades trying to either isolate or actively overthrow the Cuban government.In a stroke of coincidence, Eisenhower's meeting with Batista in 1958 also took place in Panama, imbuing Saturday's session between Obama and Castro with a sense of having come full circle.The historic gathering played out on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas, which this year included Cuba for the first time. Although the meeting wasn't publicly announced in advance, White House aides had suggested the two leaders were looking for an opportunity to meet while in Panama and to discuss the ongoing efforts to open embassies in Havana and Washington, among other issues.In his brief remarks to reporters at the start of the meeting, Obama acknowledged that Cuba, too, would continue raising concerns about U.S. policies — earning a friendly smirk from Castro."We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future, and leave behind some of the circumstances of the past that have made it so difficult for our countries to communicate," Obama said.The flurry of diplomacy, which kicked off Friday evening with an historic handshake between Obama and Castro, was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their delicate plan to restore normal relations between their countries. The two presidents sent shockwaves throughout the hemisphere in December when they announced the plan for rapprochement, and their envoys have spent the ensuing months working through thorny issues such as sanctions, the re-opening of embassies and Cuba's place on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.Although earlier in the week Obama suggested a decision to remove Cuba from the list was imminent, he didn't say Saturday whether he would move ahead with that step. The U.S. State Department recently concluded a review recommending Cuba be taken off the list, fueling speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit to announce the move.Removal from the terror list is a top priority for Castro because it would not only purge a stain on Cuba's pride, but also ease its ability to conduct simple financial transactions.Associated Press writers Nedra Pickler, Darlene Superville and Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report.Reach Kuhnhenn at http://www.twitter.com/jkuhnhenn and Lederman at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAPBy Jim Kuhnhenn And Josh Lederman, The Associated Press
Nairobi, Kenya: It was a week of reckoning for motorists in Nairobi as the county government and the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) attempted to ease traffic congestion by introducing new traffic patterns that were praised and condemned in equal measure.The measures, targeted at removing roundabouts between Westlands and Nyayo Stadium, are in the long term being seen as the panacea to Nairobi’s perennial traffic gridlock. But as Eng Njuguna Gatitu of Kenha, a member of the committee entrusted with implementation of the new measures, admits, it was a week of hits and misses.“We have encountered challenges, but on the whole the measures are working. We have had success particularly with the Westlands section, but there have been major challenges around Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts,” he said.Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko on Friday dismissed the new measures and called for an immediate return to the roundabouts mode.Saying the changes had worsened traffic flow in the city, Sonko urged Governor Evans Kidero and the Roads ministry to rescind the decision or else “we will mobilise residents and they will wake up one day and find traffic flowing freely”.Although the new measures are targeted at discouraging drivers from making right turns at the roundabouts and compel them to drive further up the road to make U-turns, the decision created gridlocks at Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts with the ripple effect being felt kilometres away.This, according to motorists and civil engineers, is because first, there was little public education about the measures and secondly, drivers were adjusting to the new traffic patterns on the go.“Motorists going past the two roundabouts reach Haile Selassie roundabout and are stopped,” says Njuguna. In addition, traffic flowing from Lang’ata Road merges with those at Mombasa Road and piles to a halt at Haile Selassie, creating a gridlock all the way back to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.There were snarl-ups running over 15 kilometres on Mombasa Road. However, analysts say these are teething problems and that the long term solution will eventually ease congestion.To resolve the current problem, Njuguna says Kenha dispatched a team of researchers to study the traffic bottle-necks on Mombasa Road — especially Nyayo Stadium and Bunyala — and implement new measures that include extended control by traffic police. “We asked police at Haile Selassie to allow longer times for vehicles coming into the city through Uhuru Highway. On Friday the scenes were much better,” he said.While the process of implementing the new patterns fall along trial and error, Kenha and the county government are pleased with how the new patterns have evolved and are calling for patience.
The Peoples Democratic Party appears to be leading in the governorship election in Ebonyi State, going by the result obtained in some of the polling units in Abakaliki metropolis in Ebonyi Local Government Area.Although, feelers from the rural areas indicated that the Labour Party was leading in there, especially in Ebonyi North and Central senatorial zones.“The PDP is purely leading in Ebonyi South senatorial zone from the results we have gathered so far. But the Labour Party is purely having it well in the rural areas in Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central zones, which are the strong areas of the Labour Party candidate and his supporters gunning for seats in the House of Assembly,” a polling agent said.At polling unit 001 in Station Urban Primary School, the All Progressives Congress polled 19 votes; the LP garnered 43 votes, while the PDP had 171 votes.At polling unit 002, also in Station Urban Primary School, the PDP gathered 178 votes against 51 votes of the LP.The PDP got 190 votes at the Stadium Cover polling unit, while the LP and APC obtained 59 and 29 votes respectively.The PDP also led at Enugwu Ukwu Hall polling units 004 and 005, under Kpirikpiri ward. It got 26 votes, the LP got 19 votes and the APC got five votes.Due to the heavy rain that lasted in most parts of the state for several hours on Saturday, results in the polling units where Governor Martin Elechi voted in Ikwo council could not be obtained.It was the same situation in Umuebe in Ohaukwu council where the former governor of the state, Dr. Sam Egwu, voted.The polling officers in Ohaozara where the PDP governorship candidate, Dave Umahi voted refused to declare the results. According to voters who stayed behind, their refusal stemmed from the fact that the LP had won in most of the polling units.“They (PDP) never believed that the Labour Party could pull the weight here (Ohaozara) and this has led to the crisis in the area,” a voter said.However, at the polling unit in Eke Market Square, which is located in Ohaozara council, the PDP polled 83 votes against 39 of the LP. In another polling unit at Eke Market Square, the PDP garnered 80 votes against 40 from the LP.
The congregation raised their hands in worship as soloist Brian McClain sang gospel inside the church hall at the Word Ministries Christian Center, Summerville.“Don’t give up,” he sang. “You’ve got to be strong, stand your ground.” The crowd rose to its feet. The choir swayed in time. Images of 50-year-old Walter Scott, some from his time in the Coast Guard, others with his children and his parents, played on rotation on a large screen behind the altar. The stage was decorated with flowers, some shaped into a blue star, the emblem of Scott’s beloved football team, the Dallas Cowboys.Scott’s casket was draped in the stars and stripes. Members of his family sat close by.The small church, where the Scott family are regular worshippers, was full to capacity. Around 200 people sat inside, as around 100 others who could not get in stood outside in the rain. Those assembled were almost entirely African American.Scott was shot dead by a white North Charleston police officer, Michael Slager, last Saturday. The case initially failed to engage national media attention, with Slager maintaining that he had killed Scott because he feared for his own safety after Scott had attempted to take his Taser.But on Tuesday eyewitness video emerged, filmed on a phone and telling an entirely different tale. The footage showed Scott running away from Slager, who fired eight times, striking the unarmed Scott four times in the back.Outside the Word ministries, television cameras from national news networks lined the lawns.Inside, pastor George Hamilton delivered a sermon describing the presence of an eyewitness to the shooting as an act of God. He advised all those in the congregation to “keep your phone handy, keep your charge up; you never know when you’re going to need to be around”.Hamilton defended the North Charleston police department as an institution, but he said what the video revealed was a killing born of racial prejudice.“There is no doubt in my mind that Walter’s death was motivated by racism,” he said. “You have to hate somebody to shoot them from behind. This hate could not have been because of the person who Walter was. This hate was because Walter was an African American.”The funeral saw a relatively high police presence – for the purpose of traffic control, officers said. One Summerville police officer stood by the entrance to the church, seemingly assisting organisers with crowd control.Scott’s obituary, published in the order of service, described him as a man who “loved the Lord”.“He expressed it by singing in the choir,” it read. “He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.”Following the funeral, the South Carolina Democratic congressman Jim Clyburn told reporters Scott’s case should become a “catalyst” for change in law enforcement agencies around the US.“I think this is a catalyst to get people to face up to the fact that we’ve got problems in this country,” Clyburn said. “I think this exposed something that is already there.”Attorneys for the Scott family also addressed reporters. They confirmed, as has previously been reported, that Scott owed child support payments and that a bench warrant had been issued in his name. One of the attorneys, Chris Stewart, said it was the family’s belief that Scott had fled from his car after being pulled over by Slager for a routine traffic violation out of fear of going to jail over the arrears.On Saturday, local newspaper the Post and Courier published quotes from Scott taken from a 2013 interview in which he described being thrown in jail for 15 days 15 years ago, for a failure to pay child support. As a result, Scott lost his job at a film company.“I got mad at everybody in the whole world because I just lost the best job I ever had,” he told the Post and Courier. “I just stopped doing everything. I just closed myself into a little shell and started doing things I shouldn’t have been doing.”As the funeral on Saturday came to a close, the mourners walked in single file and slow procession to view Scott’s body. A soloist sang “I’m going up to yonder to be with my Lord” on a loop. It seemed to last for more than 20 minutes, as people came to pay their final respects.
Police have released dramatic footage of a high speed crash south of Brisbane late Saturday night, in which a car hit a pole, flipped then burst into flames.A 19-year-old man suffered a broken neck in the smash, which occurred after police attempted to stop a car in Yatala about 11.15pm.Police initially tried to intercept the Holden Commodore when they spotted it being driven erratically on Stanmore Road.Officers followed the car into a small residential street, where it then evaded both a police car and an officer who stood on the roadway in a bid to stop the driver.The police helicopter tracked the Commodore as it sped along Stanmore Road, where it ran a red light and narrowly avoided a collision with another car.Polair then continued to film as the car crashed into a pole at high speed, flipped onto its roof and caught fire.It then captured officers and passing motorists working to extricate the occupants from the wreckage.The 19-year-old passenger was the most seriously injured of the car's three occupants.The alleged driver, a man aged 20, and a 17-year-old female passenger suffered shock and bruising.All three were taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.

AUGUSTA, Georgia - The biggest names in golf put major pressure on Jordan Spieth but the young American refused to crack, carding a two-under 70 on Saturday to take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters.Masters champions Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson and world number one Rory McIlroy all took turns trying to rattle the 21-year-old Texan, but Spieth held steady on a sweaty Georgia afternoon, setting a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under 200 to better the previous mark of 201 shared by Woods and Raymond Floyd.Runnerup to Bubba Watson last year in his Masters debut, Spieth will again feature in Sunday's final pairing where he will be joined by Englishman Justin Rose, who emerged as a green jacket contender with a blazing back nine.The 2013 U.S. Open winner, 10 shots back of the leader on the front nine, collected five birdies over his final six holes for a five-under 67.Phil Mickelson also had a 67 to sit five off the pace while Charley Hoffman returned a one-under 71 to leave him six back.McIlroy and Woods were among those at six under after shooting 68s.The third round of the Masters is often filled with drama but with Woods, the 14-time major winner; Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion; and McIlroy, chasing a career grand slam, all on the charge the atmosphere around Augusta National was electric with possibilities as Spieth's composure was put to the test.Holding a five-shot overnight lead, the unflappable Spieth had threatened to run away with the year's first major, widening his lead to seven before a double-bogey at the par-four 17th.After carding just a single bogey through the opening two rounds, Spieth had three on Saturday along with his double-bogey, but also compiled seven birdies."I knew that something under par would be a good round," Spieth told reporters. "The greens kind of baked up and got quick and slippery."Obviously being four-under at one point in the round and closing it out at two-under is disappointing."Obviously would have liked to have finished the round a little bit better but also could have been worse."They are going to bring their game and I've got to have a relatively stress-free round going; and when I say that, I mean give myself some tap in pars and not have to make so many putts."Competing for the first time in two months after a self-imposed absence from the PGA Tour to retool his game, Woods flashed glimpses of the form that carried him to four green jackets as he joined McIlroy, Kevin Streelman (70), Kevin Na (70) and Dustin Johnson (73) in a tie for fifth, 10 shots back of the frontrunner."I've got to go out early and do what I did a few years ago, I shot 30 or 31," said Woods refusing to wave the white flag on a fifth Masters title. "I'm going to have to do something like that and continue on the back nine, at least give myself a chance going in the back nine."It's in Jordan's hands right now, he can run off and make three birdies coming in and put a substantial gap between himself and the rest of the field."But you just never know."McIlroy made a spectacular start with an eagle on the par-five second.On the brink of missing the cut with nine holes to play on Friday, the Northern Irishman grinded his way to eight under but stumbled with bogeys at the 16th and 18th."A disappointing finish," lamented McIlroy. "But overall felt like I played pretty well; and as I say, just a little disappointed the way I finished."
The hallowed halls of century-old Central Tech have many stories — such as the nude woman Leo Darmitz encountered on his first day of school.“There are a lot of great stories to be told,” said Darmitz, who graduated in 1960 and is the alumni organizer for Central Technical High School’s 100th anniversary celebrations.In 1955, Darmitz showed up for his first day of school but wasn’t pre-rgistered and found many courses at the school were filled.He and a group of other students who hadn’t registered were put into a group with no set time table.“At the completion of class, we asked where we were to go next. They just looked for vacant or lightly filled classes and sent us there,” Darmitz said.For third period of the first day, he and his classmates were sent to join an art class with senior students in a large studio with chalk dust covering the floors.There were no desks in the studio, only chairs which the older students propped upside down to mount their drawing pads.The teacher was not impressed the younger students didn’t know the drill, Darmitz recalled.His group of students were instructed to gather supplies and prepare for class.“Without any further introduction as to what to do, the teacher turned to leave. As he was doing so he said, ‘You know the exercise, get to it,” Darmitz said.“There was a moment of silence as the teacher left the room. Then the drapery that shrouded the small platform in the corner parted and out stepped a female model, completely nude.”Alumni at Central Tech gearing up for its 100th anniversary are working on publishing a 120-page book to celebrate a century of achievements and memories.There may not be an illustration of the nude art model.Central Tech has a long list of famous alumni that includes Ed Mirvish of Honest Ed’s and a patron of the arts, Johnny Lombardi of CHIN Radio and A pioneer of multicultural radio broadcasting in Canada, George Chuvalo the five-time Canadian heavyweight boxing champion and CFL linebacker Tristan Black who played with the Toronto Argonauts as a member of the 100th Grey Cup winning team.There is a long tradition of students at Central Tech excelling, said principal Lisa Edwards.“At CTS teachers, coaches and mentors look to find what a student is passionate about and develop it. This is just part of what makes students that graduate from Central Technical School so successful,” Edwards said.The alumni celebration weekend is being planned for Oct. 16 t0 18.To become involved, make a donation or purchase space in the book of memories, call Darmitz at 905-891-2748.
Those of us that are willing to follow after the order of this high Priesthood Jesus, we are also going to stand and say “Lord, here am I and with my whole body” Jesus said, “For me, I am come to do Thy will, Oh God.” Will you make such a choice? Will you come to that level of decision where you are saying, “Lord, I am come to do Thy will O, God”. In this church where you gave me an opportunity and a body to serve you with, it is your will I came to do. And I am ready to die doing it. I am not here to compete for popularity, I am not here to compete for strength, I am not here to compete for power, neither am I here to compete for people’s pockets. “I am come to do Thy will 0h God as it is written concerning me.” That will is to offer your body as a living sacrifice. That is what Jesus regarded as the will of God. The will of God for Jesus is not activities; it is the surrender of His body for God to work in.Your Whole Body… Rather than Sacrifices.This is another serious aberration God must deliver us from. Many of us keep our bodies intact for our ‘self-purposes’, while we look for some other things to give to God. Some of us give God gifts, money, etc while withholding our bodies for sins or personal ambitions and careers. We need to offer to God this whole body- mind, intellect, feelings, and all, for His activity to be done inside. God needs to sit inside this body and do His work.“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God; that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service”. (Romans 12: 1).Some brothers with good voices are presenting their voices. They seem to feel that God needs their voices, while the rest of their body is theirs – theirs to fornicate with, to live arrogantly with. So, we have so many good singers singing for Jesus in the church but their bodies are most undisciplined. They are in the choir. They seemed to have lent God their talents. They are playing the guitar or the organ and occasionally they draw attention to themselves using the instruments. They believe that there is nobody else that God can use. God is not asking you to present your voice. What does He want? It is when God takes possession of a man that his life becomes useful. When you are going to present your body, it means the man, the former occupant, with his personal programmes, desires, and taste, is no longer there. You must become a novice because the man that was using that body has passed away. It has to be Jesus who is going to now sit inside the body using the hand, the mouth, and the voice.That is why in God’s kingdom, it is not necessarily true, that because you were a music specialist in the world, that you can automatically become a music minister in the church. We see such people just after two months of repentance, already starting a music ministry for God. If things are to be done correctly, such persons ought to be sent to go and sit down yet. They will unlearn all the music they learnt, and then learn to humbly ask: “Jesus how do I play guitar for you?” Jesus could then decide that He did not save them to play the guitar. What actually their bodies are needed for is to sweep the church, since there are people who are already playing the guitar.There could be certain things that you know how to do before for the ‘flesh’, yet if you want to become useful to God, even those things will first be removed from your hands. This is because you used to do those things with your bodies for the old man. God will remove them from you first so that the old man can die and you can find your course in life. God is asking you to present to Him your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. The Bible calls that your reasonable service. It is your ministry. Brethren, ministry is not preaching, singing nor teaching per se. Preaching, singing, and teaching, are all secondary assignments. Our ministry, our reasonable service, is being available for God to work in us. What you now see God doing in me is not my work. This is where the confusion is. Jesus never forgot that. He kept saying it.Pray that your eyes of understanding be opened!

Photo: Facebook.Following on from last October's success, the next big fight night is set down for April 18.Headlining a dozen corporate fights, is an International Professional Light Welterweight bout between Western Bay's Anthony TNT Taylor and an extremely experienced Thai opponent.The international contest, will be the main attraction fought over eight two-minute rounds in what should be an explosive contest at the QE2 Youth Centre's Memorial Hall.Taylor who fashioned an impressive nine win, one draw and one loss in the pay to punch ranks, has raw power in both fists, which should keep the expected sell-out crowd on its feet.At the last Clash of the Corporates, Taylor was in dynamic form stopping Taranaki's Daniel Maxwell in the sixth round of their New Zealand Welterweight title fight.The New Zealand professional title follows a decorated Amateur career, where the Tauranga puncher won two Boxing New Zealand Light Welterweight crowns.The highlight of Taylor's time in the amateur ranks, was to earn selection for the New Zealand Commonwealth Games team that took part in the 2010 Commonwealth event in India.However, the Western Bay pugilist won't be taking the challenge in the ring from Kru Chain lightly come April 18.The Thai pro boxer is a Muay Thai kickboxing veteran, who has had a multitude of visits to the kick boxing ring in recent years and has a reputation as a genuine hard nut in Thai kick boxing.While patrons at the event will get to watch plenty of action in the lead-up corporate fights – Anthony TNT Taylor won't want to leave the decision in the hands of the judges against Kru Chain and is likely to chase victory by the short route.
A display of community solidarity and support could not be stronger with dozens of volunteers rolling over 14,000 cheese rolls to support an Alexandra family.The Becks Hall, in Central Otago, was bustling with activity on Sunday - music blaring, pots stirred, cheese mixture poured, bread rolled and crates stacked.Ashlee Sutherland, of Becks, organised the fundraiser to raise money for Ashleigh and Peter Brown, whose 10-week old son Riley is battling the rare congenital disorder Zellweger spectrum.  Babies who suffer from the disorder - for which there is no treatment or cure - typically do not live past their first year.  Some community fundraising had helped the Brown family make mortgage payments and pay bills during weeks of hospital treatments, but the family was struggling.

We just sold more and more really."Volunteer Chontelle Saunders, of Alexandra, said making the cheese rolls was easy once they got into a routine."They are great friends and they would do it for us."
