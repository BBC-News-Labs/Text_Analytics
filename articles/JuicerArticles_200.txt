Alice Beer, who worked alongside Miss Dando on the BBC's Children in Need and Holiday shows, told a newspaper yesterday (sun) she received the sinister letter in her BBC mail, which bosses had passed on to police.But the 49-year-old said she had not been interviewed by officers either before or after Miss Dando was shot dead outside her home in Fulham, west London, in April 1999.Barry George, of Fulham, was initially convicted in July 2001 but was acquitted of killing the 37-year-old presenter at a retrial in August 2008.Ms Beer told the paper: "There are a lot of questions I would like answering. They've been at the back of my mind. I waited for a call from the police after Jill's death - but it never came. Nobody spoke to me about the threat."Nobody questioned anything. If no stone were left unturned in that investigation then I would have been called."Now a presenter on ITV's This Morning, Ms Beer was working on BBC consumer programme Watchdog when she received the threats in March 1999, the paper said.Her colleague on the show, Anne Robinson, received a death threat by phone three days after the killing, which according to the paper said: "From Serbia, going to kill Anne Robinson, Alice Beer and two others."Ms Beer said she believed her threat was penned by the same perpetrator that threatened Miss Dando.She said: "The letters were in the same handwriting from a person claiming they wanted to capture and rape us. Mine was in amongst my mail at the BBC. My letter was handed over to the police via the programme editors or the management of the BBC. I was told Jill Dando had had a similar letter in the same handwriting and the local Shepherd's Bush police were investigating."The murder had been a "slick" and "professional" operation, she added.A spokesman for Scotland Yard said: "The Metropolitan Police Service fully investigated the circumstances into the murder of Jill Dando. Two trials took place and the investigation was subject to an internal review.
Hopes of a sunny Easter break have been washed away as Britain braces itself for a week of wind, rain and even snow.The country was hit by torrential rain and gale-force winds yesterday, and the miserable weather is set to continue.Forecasters have predicted Easter Sunday itself will be dry - but still cold and cloudy.Temperatures will plunge to a low of -1C overnight and up to 5cm of snow could fall on higher ground in northern England and Scotland.The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for ice across the top half of Britain and has said there is "potential for hazardous driving conditions".Met Office forecaster Charles Powell said it has been wet and windy and "it is not going to get that much better soon".He said: "We could see one or two icy stretches in northern parts of the UK. That's because we will see temperatures dropping down to maybe -1C across Scotland and the northern half of the UK."Wintry snow showers are expected to hit Scotland today while the rest of Britain will be hit by lashing rain and strong winds.Mr Powell said: "It will be quite heavy rain. The band of rain will sweep through the West and parts of Wales and Cumbria will see the most rain."It will hit southern areas in the mid afternoon. We will see winds picking up again with gales quite widespread across much of the UK."They will reach around 50mph and in a couple of places we could see winds of around 60mph, especially in the West."Strong winds and showers will continue in the middle of the week before calming down on Friday.While the weather is gloomy, there is a glimmer of hope as Britain should enjoy a respite from the wind and rain on Saturday and Easter Sunday itself.But he warned that the earliest Britain will see decent sunshine is Easter Monday.Mr Powell said: "It looks like the rain will by and large clear at the weekend, but it will be quite cloudy. It looks like a dry weekend with winds, but it probably won't be bright."People can head outside and do things and travel around a bit more safely."But I'm not going to promise a huge amount of sunshine because I think there will be quite a lot of cloud. But it will be quite a marked change from this weekend."
Lagos Commandant of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps, NSCDC, Gabriel Abafi has commended Nigerians for coming out en masse to participate in Saturday’s election.Abafi made this comment while monitoring the voting activities around the state lauded the electorate for coming out to participate in the electoral process despite the hue and cries about the safety of voters and the security concerns in the nation.He noted that people who still have the interest of the country at heart are much more than those who he referred to as saboteurs hell bent on dragging the fortunes of the county backwards.He commended INEC for ensuring the sanctity of the electoral process, urging them to ensure that the little hitches noticed in many polling units about the operations of the card readers are addressed against the next round of elections.Meanwhile some residents of Lagos yesterday lauded the efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in conducting free and fair elections in the country.The residents who hailed the electoral umpire, said the elections went on smoothly and postponing till Sunday in some places where materials arrived late.A Health and Safety professional, Mr. Vincent Fagbolagun, said the introduction of the Card Reader also improved the electoral process.“If we study the lapses very well and we improve on the gaps identified, I am sure it will take our elections to the next level which is a free and fair one to start with.“Free and fair elections will take away violence and we will begin to trust ourselves knowing that when any government comes in place, they have to deliver to the masses,’’ Fagbolagun said.He said the conduct of the elections would challenge elected officers to deliver the dividends of democracy to the masses.Another resident, Mr. Micheal Okosis, a photographer, said that it took him five minutes to be accredited, adding that the process was smooth and fast.“These elections have shown that Nigerians are beginning to understand the democratic system of government because people really came out to vote for their choices,” he said.A trader, Mrs Ayantoye Iyabo, said that in her area at Railway Line, Ebute-Metta, Lagos, said the elections was peaceful, saying that she voted before 4: 00 pm on Saturday.“We want government to provide stable power supply and the government should also improve on health facilities,’’ Ayantoye said.A businessman, Mr Tunde Akanni, said he was unable to vote because he could not get his PVC. Akanni, however, commended the efforts of INEC in conducting a free and fair elections, adding that Nigerians should continue to give INEC support to enable it achieve its aims.
The National Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Mai Mala Buni, has charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to declare election results that truly represents the choice of the electorate.He made the call yesterday in Damaturu while answering questions from newsmen, stressing that Nigerians have expressed their commitment to democracy through the massive turnout of voters in the Saturday election.“The unprecedented massive turnout of voters across Nigeria demonstrates their commitment to democracy, their choice should be respected and declared as winners of the elections,” he urged.He observed that despite the security challenges and the hitches recorded with the elections, Nigerians committed themselves towards ensuring the success of democratic process in Nigeria.He equally charged security agents to maintain absolute neutrality in carrying out their responsibilities without partisanship to any of the political parties and their candidates.“The security agents must resist attempts by politicians to drag them into politics and resist actions that may align their loyalty to a candidate in this election,” he said.He further urged INEC to improve on the challenges faced with the card readers and other problems including delay in delivery of election materials and personnel.The secretary called on the electorate to remain peaceful, law abiding and cooperate with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and security operatives to ensure the success of the exercise.
The Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Education, Prof. Sola Adeyeye, has been declared the winner of the Osun Central Senatorial District election.The Returning Officer at Osun Central Senatorial District, Mr. Jide Olutomi, declared the serving senator who is the candidate of the All Progressives Congress the winner of the poll with the total votes of 137,379.The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the senatorial district, Mr. Oludaisi Aina, came second with 82,529 votes.The incumbent member of the House of Representatives representing Osogbo,/Orolu/ Irepodun/ Olorunda Federal Constituency, Mr. Lasun Yusuf, who contested on the platform of the APC scored 73,678 votes to defeat PDP’s candidate, Mr. Bashir Arogundade, who polled 33,783.The Returning Officer for the federal constituency, Dr. Babatunde Sosan, announced the result in Osogbo on Sunday.Copyright PUNCH.

A collation officer at one of the wards in Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State was arrested by men of the Ondo State Police Command on Sunday for allegedly mutilating a result sheet while entering the figures from the election.The situation was said to have created a mild drama as polling agents and vigilant voters suspected that the official was up to something untoward.The police were immediately alerted and the collation officer arrested.Confirming the incident, the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Mr. Segun Agbaje, said the situation created a problem, but the issue was being handled carefully.He said although the officer was arrested earlier on Sunday, he had since been released to complete the work he had started.Agbaje explained that the cancellations done on the sheet did not necessarily amount to an offence, since another sheet could be obtained for a re-entry of the results.“I told the police that arresting him will not solve the problem. A fresh sheet could have been given to him, so that a clearer entry of the figures could be made.“He had to be released so that the work could be completed and a new sheet to enter in the results given to him while investigation can continue,” Agbaje said.Copyright PUNCH.

Nigerians were yesterday eagerly awaiting the results of Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections.The elections went into second day yesterday after technical glitches occasioned by the Smart Card Readers (SCRs) deployed in the polling unitsby the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).Few of the machines introduced to do biometric verification of Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs) to guide against multiple voting failed to read the cards, a situation that forced a slight adjustment in the voting period.These technical problems and the delayed arrival of election materials and officials forced INEC to extend voting till yesterday.The extension was only in the units where the devices malfunctioned and in areas where polling materials arrived late.Returning Officers and party agents were busy last night collating the results for the presidential, senatorial and House of Representatives elections.Below are the results of the  elections as announced by INEC officials yesterday.
Travis Trice vowed a day earlier that he wasn't going to cry should the Michigan State Spartans continue their improbable run to the Final Four.The senior guard's vow lasted no more than 10 seconds once the final horn sounded after Michigan State's 76-70 overtime victory over Louisville in a thrilling NCAA tournament East Regional final Sunday.Amid the frenzied celebration, Trice squatted down at center court and began to sob uncontrollably."I was actually trying to hold it in," he said. "I try to keep it even keeled. I'm mad that I even cried now."That's when senior forward Branden Dawson interjected by saying that was the first time he's ever seen Trice cry.Counted out for done as recently as six weeks ago, the seventh-seeded Spartans (27-11) let it all out in a thrilling display of perseverance and defensive grit to oust the fourth-seeded Cardinals (27-9)."I'd like to tell you that I thought five different times this year that we were good enough to get to a Final Four, but I'd be lying to you," said Coach Tom Izzo, who described this as the best of seven regional final victories he has enjoyed. "But I think the burning desire to be in this Final Four, and they didn't want to be a group that didn't make it. I think it was more of the battle cry all year long."Trice led the Spartans with 17 points. Dawson had 11 rebounds, including a key putback of Bryn Forbes' missed three-point shot with 31.7 seconds left in overtime. And Denzel Valentine scored 15 points for a Michigan State team that won for the 12th time in 15 games. It's a run that included them knocking off second-seeded Virginia last weekend and third-seeded Oklahoma in the regional semifinal Friday.Michigan State will face Duke, which beat Gonzaga, 66-52, in the South Regional final, on Saturday in Indianapolis.Wayne Blackshear had 28 points for the Cardinals in a game that featured 11 lead changes.There could have been a 12th with 4.9 seconds left in regulation, when Cardinals forward Mangok Mathiang hit his first free throw to tie the game on a shot that hit off the heel of the rim and bounced high and in. But he wasn't so fortunate on his second one, which also hit the heel and bounced wide left."Sometimes it can be a cruel game. I was positive we were going to win it when the first free throw went in because it shouldn't have gone in," Cardinals Coach Rick Pitino said. "It's very difficult for all the players. But real proud of our guys."Louisville was denied a shot of making its third Final Four in four years, and 11th overall.It's the ninth Final Four appearance for the Spartans, and first since 2010, when they lost, 52-50, to Butler in the national semifinals. Izzo has led them to seven Final Fours including the 2000 national championship.The Spartans did it with a roster that was regarded as having less talent than the team that lost in the regional final to Connecticut a year ago. Michigan State lost three of its top four scorers."Everybody doubted us. Everybody had us down and out," Valentine said. "They didn't have us making the tournament. We just kept strong. We believe in ourselves."The Spartans rallied from a 40-32 halftime deficit to eventually build a 61-59 lead with 3:57 left, when Trice hit two free throws.Michigan State took control in overtime, starting with Forbes hitting a three-pointer 26 seconds in.The Spartans then sealed it in the final 31 seconds. Dawson did what Izzo's teams have done well over the years: He put back a three-point miss by Forbes to put Michigan State up, 74-70.Valentine batted away Quentin Snider's pass into the paint on the Cardinals' next possession, and Trice sealed the win by hitting two free throws with 10.1 seconds left.Michigan State's defense — Izzo's other trademark — played havoc with the Cardinals. After hitting 17 of 32 attempts in the first half, Louisville managed to make six of its final 32.It is the third straight year one conference has had two teams in the Final Four. The Southeastern Conference did last year with Kentucky and Florida and the Big East had Louisville and Syracuse in 2013.The last time the Big Ten did it was 2005 with Michigan State and Illinois.Though Blackshear stepped up his performance in what became his final collegiate game, Cardinals junior forward Montrezl Harrell struggled.Harrell missed his last five shots and was off on five of nine free throws in what was also his final game. Harrell has already indicated his intention to enter the NBA draft."It hurts a lot," he said."It's over," added Blackshear, a member of the Cardinals 2013 national championship team. "But I get to look back and say I had a great career."Blackshear had his nose bloodied with 3:57 left, when he hit a driving layup and was fouled hard by Matt Costello. Dillon Avare came off the bench to hit the free throw while Blackshear missed a few possessions while being tended to on the bench.
Day to day with the maestro of music photography.When you think about contemporary music photography, few names pop up as standouts or icons—but of the ones that do, Danny Clinch is at the top of the list. Since cutting his teeth in the early ’90s with everyone from Tupac to Pearl Jam, Clinch has attained a level of comfort with major artists that few photographers enjoy, to the point of even joining them onstage with his harmonica from time to time.When he’s not shooting campaigns for John Varvatos, he’s a staple at most major music events—his portable portrait studio is a mainstay at Bonnaroo and backstage at the Grammys. Clinch is a rare name brand, far removed from the unwashed hordes that are the digital era’s freelance photographers, a master of his craft and a member of the A list he shoots. His Instagram feed is proof of that status, often showing celebrity images you’ve had burned into your retinas but never knew who shot them, but just as often offering a glimpse of his life on the road or the quieter side of things, surfing or chilling in South America. With a newish book—Still Moving—and a show up at the Milk Gallery in New York City, Clinch is a busy guy, to say the least. We caught him between shoots for a quick interview, and he’ll be taking over our own Instagram account for a couple days starting Monday.So how did you get your start in photography?My mom is the snapshot queen! She got me interested initially, then my love of music and photography took over.My early influences were Annie Leibovitz and Jim Marshall, then I discovered Irving Penn, Robert Frank, and Danny Lyon.How has Instagram changed or influenced the way you approach photography?I have always been a photographer that never leaves home without his camera, so being able to share photographs spontaneously is really cool.It’s also is a great marketing tool and lets people know what you’re up to. The other thing I love about Instagram is that I feel like people who otherwise would have never picked up a camera are learning to see the world in new ways.Who are your favorite accounts?Lots of friends, Wayne Lawrence from the Orchard Beach series, Sacha Lecca. Clark Little…Too many to note! Shane Dorian. For some reason, I’m drawn to surfing, cars, and motorcycles, as well as music.What have you been working on lately?My book, Still Moving, came out in September, so a lot of book signings and gallery shows. I have one up now at Milk Gallery in NYC called Walls of Sound. A new limited edition book called Motor Drive, which is a series of musicians with, in, or on cars, motorcycles, tour buses…anything with a motor. It’s limited to 340 books, the same number of cubic inches in Tom Morello’s 1972 Dodge Demon motor. Also, a doc on Blind Melon singer Shannon Hoon, whose family gave me all his personal videotapes from his time with the band. He was a relentless documentarian, pre-iPhone, and it will be a powerful film.You’ve been shooting music for a long time. How have you seen it change with the advent of digital and phone photography?Well, of course everyone has a camera phone and is now a photographer. Digital creates a very easy entry point for new photographers, but at the end of the day, it still needs to be a great photograph!I would say going to San Quentin with Metallica and the Malloy Brothers to shoot the video for “St. Anger.” We had to sign a release stating that they would not negotiate for our release if we happened to be taken hostage. I have some of these photographs in Still Moving.What’s the worst shooting situation you’ve ever been in?I can’t recall. I’m usually up for the challenge of creating something positive out of chaos.
Beach Energy shares dropped as much as 5.6 per cent in early trading after Chevron abandoned its $349 million unconventional exploration venture in the Cooper Basin, leaving Beach to find an alternative partner at a time of reduced spending.The shares in Beach, whose largest shareholder is Seven Group Holdings, slid 6c to $1.02 shortly after the market opened. Shares in Icon Energy, the junior partner in one of the joint ventures with Chevron, slumped as much as 18 per cent.Chevron said late on Friday that it would not proceed with a second stage of their Nappamerri Trough drilling venture, exercising its right to walk away for no compensation after spending $190 million on the first stage. The second stage would have involved pilot testing for production to try to demonstrate the viability of unconventional gas production in one of Australia's leading prospective regions for shale resources.Chevron's decision was "unsurprising" given the US energy giant's cost saving and divestment program, said JPMorgan energy analyst Benjamin Wilson.Chevron recently upped its target for divestments by $US5 billion ($6.5 billion), although much of that was already achieved on Friday with its sudden $4.6 billion exit from Caltex Australia's share register.Chevron's decision is a blow to Beach and could raise questions about unconventional oil and gas prospects in Australia, particularly as the Cooper Basin's existing infrastructure made it a contending region. Earlier on Friday, Beach advised on an upgrade of "contingent resources" in the ATP855 permit in Queensland in the Nappamerri Trough, by 943 billion cubic feet to 1572 bcf.Beach Energy senior executives have spoken openly about the possibility of Chevron exiting the venture, although former managing director Reg Nelson had said the company was satisfied with the results of the initial phase, which pointed to a large unconventional resource in the region.Mr Wilson said he had got the impression in a recent meeting with new managing director Rob Cole that Beach was planning for a future without the backing of Chevron in the Nappamerri Trough. But he said the decision was still "a fresh blow" coming on the heels of the early redemption of Beach's $300 million convertible note.Beach earlier this month said it would use undrawn bank debt to redeem the notes after investors holding more than 90 per cent of the notes opted to redeem them."In light of the current oil price environment it is difficult to draw a conclusion as to whether Chevron's exit from the NTNG [Napamerri Trough Natural Gas] JV is related to a view on the commercial prospects of the asset or whether it was a soft target for spending cuts," Mr Wilson said in a note to clients."Chevron, like most other majors and independent E&Ps [exploration and production companies] globally, is high grading exploration prospects and it is entirely likely that the long dated and uncertain nature of the NTNG prospect does not mesh with its current focus on conserving capital for near term committed projects and production.On Friday, Beach said it would scale back spending on the Nappamerri Trough exploration, pointing to "minimal spend" anticipated in the Queensland part of the venture with Icon Energy in the rest of the 2015 financial year and into 2016.Mr Cole said Beach looked forward to progressing the work "at a pace consistent with prevailing market conditions."The deal between Beach and Chevron was hailed as groundbreaking for the unconventional sector when it was struck in February 2013 as it represented the biggest potential commitment by a foreign company in the local sector.In the first phase, Chevron paid about $US190 million in cash and exploration costs. The second phase, had it gone ahead, would have involved a further $US124 million commitment, with a further $US35 million payment to follow.As Chevron has decided to exit, its interest is reassigned to Beach at no cost.
Benefit cuts and reforms are undermining efforts to help recovering alcoholics and drug users, according to a new reportThe study, by West Dunbartonshire Alcohol and Drug Partnership, found that one in five clients affected by welfare reforms had increased their alcohol or drug use. More than half did not have enough money to feed themselves and their families and 41 per cent had had to borrow money to survive.The draft study, has yet to be signed off by partners including WDADP, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and West Dunbartonshire Council, is due to be published in May.It says changes to eligibility have made it harder for people with addiction issues to qualify for some disability benefits, while a huge increase in benefit sanctions has had a particular impact on the clients of addiction agencies. A third of those surveyed had seen Job Seekers' Allowance (JSA) or Employment Support Allowance (ESA) payments stopped for an alleged breach of the rules.The report says benefit cuts and changes are having a dramatic effect on people in recovery from addiction. "Welfare reform changes [are] having a detrimental impact on the recovery journey of many service users, not simply affecting their financial circumstances, but also impacting on their mental and physical health and wellbeing," it says.Staff and volunteers are also being affected, the authors say."Addiction service workers were coming under increased pressure to help clients complete benefit forms, provide letters of support and advocacy."The arrival of Universal Credit, the new benefit due to be rolled out later this year, will require people who work in part time or low paid jobs to look for more work to increase their income, it says. "This is likely to impact on staff and volunteers working for addiction and mental health services as well as clients."While UC will introduce a job seeking 'holiday' of up to six months for people seeking treatment for drug or alcohol dependency, this is may not be helpful, the report says as it could lead to the wrong people being referred for help, overloading services and leading to longer waiting times for rehab and support.One senior nurse told researchers that working with clients was being made more difficult. "Most of our patients don't have a lot of money at the best of times, and now quite a lot are coming in and saying they are losing their benefits because they have been a minute late for an appointment or haven't completed their work diary the right way and they have nothing to live on for weeks."The report adds: "behind each statistic are some harrowing stories of people who are struggling to deal with an addiction while under unprecedented financial pressures."A consultant psychiatrist commented: "anything that leads to increased levels of anxiety is likely to lead to higher levels of relapse."David Liddell, director of Scottish Drugs Forum, said the findings were being replicated across Scotland and had been borne out by his organisation's own work."An unpublished survey we did at the end of last year found that 43% of services reported a negative impact and 69% had seen an increased workload as a result of benefit reform" he said."Clients are facing a lack of money for utilities, debt, stress and rent arrears, an increased reliance on foodbanks and for some an increase in offending. That is all increasing the risk of relapse."Drug agency staff are not welfare advisors and spending more of their time writing letters in support of clients takes away from work to tackle addiction. This is not a good use of public funds."Drug and alcohol dependency was not a lifestyle choice, he said and vulnerable people need support. "Apart from the need to care for the most marginalised in society, this will cost more money in terms of increased crime, use of hospital and homelessness services, and chasing rent arrears," he added.
‘Consumers need to put more pressure on the banks by threatening to switch their business’Paul from Dublin has been in touch with a story we think is instructive. He says he succeeded in persuading Bank of Ireland to reduce the interest rate on his mortgage, thereby saving himself more than €700 in interest payments this year alone.“All borrowers on standard variable rate mortgages should be pressurising their lenders to reduce the rate,” he says. “I’ve been with BoI over 30 years, since I was student, but I’m sick of paying penal mortgage rates. The cost of borrowing money is minuscule at the moment, yet the bank was charging me 4 per cent.”This was based on what Paul says was “a completely false loan-to-value calculation, because the original loan sum included bridging finance, which was paid back within months, when the sale of our old house went through”.The money borrowed was used to refurbish his house, thereby increasing its value. “So our loan-to-value is less than 25 per cent,” he says, “but this wasn’t reflected in the mortgage interest rate. KBC Bank were offering 3.75 per cent, plus a further 0.2 per cent reduction if I moved my current account.“It’s a big inconvenience to move, but I was prepared to do so in view of the long-term savings to be made over the remaining 15 years on the mortgage.“But first I rang Bank of Ireland and told them I intended moving. I expressed my dismay that I was being treated so badly after so many years as a loyal customer. I made it clear my LTV was far lower than they were giving me credit for. I threatened to move my current account as well.“To be fair to the bank, they came back and knocked 0.3 per cent off my rate, without requiring a house valuation.Paul believed that was still too high, and he pressed for a further improvement. “But they wouldn’t budge. They have presumably calculated I’m less likely to go to the trouble of moving for the sake of a further 0.15 per cent improvement over at KBC,” because you have to employ a solicitor to do the legal work and obtain a valuation.Paul is mad as hell about the high standard variable rates that people are paying. “I’m angry that we are paying the cost of recapitalising Bank of Ireland. If the Government wanted to find one thing that would help it regain popularity, it would be to pressurise the banks to lower their rates; this would be worth far more in our pockets than the cost of any water charges. But my experience shows that consumers also need to put more pressure on the banks by threatening to switch their business.”A reader call Tim is baffled. He has car insurance with Allianz Direct, which is selling a product called Bonus Protection. “Essentially, this is an insurance policy that insures your no-claims bonus. So in the event of a claim, the anticipation is that you don’t have a related increase in your insurance policy the next year,” he explains.“I got a knock in the supermarket car park on Wednesday so called Allianz about claiming. I explained my bonus protection scheme.They told him “it was important I know how bonus protection worked. He said it did not mean a crash was not considered in next year’s premiums, as most people think. In other words, a claim will be included in the calculation of next year’s premium, even if you have bonus protection insurance.”Tim was given an example. He was told that if the “base rate” for car insurance was €1,000 and you have a 60 per cent no-claims discount, your policy should cost, without extras, €400. “Next year, as a result of your claim, your policy might rise to €2,000, but, because your bonus is protected at 60 per cent, the 60 per cent still applies. So on a €2,000 policy, you pay €800.”He then found out that he is allowed one claim every three years under the bonus protection scheme. “But the scheme is renewed annually at a cost of about €60. So what am I paying for in year two and three, if I can’t claim – or is the real cost of bonus protection €180?”He then does the maths. “If the cost of repair is about €500, and I have a €250 excess, then I pay €250 plus the bonus protection payment in year two and three, which adds €120, bringing my contribution to the €500 repair bill to €370, plus a potential doubling of my insurance costs next year. My insurance costs are about €360 per year, which means that in order to get the insurance to pay the €500 repair bill, it could cost me €360, plus €370 – a total of €730 to have the insurance pay the €500 repair bill, plus additional costs.We contacted Allianz, and a spokesman said “bonus protection” was not “premium protection”.“Where ‘no-claims bonus protection’ cover has been opted for, the value of the bonus or ‘discount’ to be applied remains intact, but the underlining premium can change if the driver has an accident.” The spokesman suggested our reader contact the Financial Ombudsman if he was not happy.
I’ve caught up with your Xenoblade Chronicles 3D review – I regret to say that it won’t tempt me towards a New 3DS, albeit for idiosyncratic reasons.I guess that I still made Nintendo happy by buying my 3DS XL just over a month before the upgraded models were announced, and I’m still busy with the games I bought before and (cheaply from Argos) after the hardware. They’ll be happier still that they didn’t have to refund me for my copy of the original Xenoblade Chronicles.  I bought that back in 2012 (after there was no discernible drop in price) and it just didn’t work: a ‘turn your Wii off’ message was all that ever resulted.I’d of exchanged it at my local HMV if they still had a copy but had to ring Nintendo; their eventual suggestion was to send the disc back for a repair, and they duly sent out a Freepost label. A reorganisation at home saw that and the game vanish, until late last year and it was my pleasant surprise to find that it booted up first time. It’s pulled the old trick a couple of times, but it looks like I’ve got the knack now. The game itself has proved to be a lovable mixed bag.I’m slowly getting the hang of combat but that confidence always seems to precede a boss or high-level monster battle where it really isn’t clear what I did on the thirtieth attempt that improved on all the previous failures.  You mention the small script on the New 3DS – I’m finding it hellish on a 32-inch set! I really like the ambience though, exploring’s fun, the English voices are fine for me; and cliff-diving is clearly never going to grow old! (Although, in a traditional late entry for the emotional Hot Topic, it does remind me with which character I first jumped…]I’m not doing myself any favours by having two other role-playing games on the go on the handheld, I’m afraid; not to mention Animal Crossing and, as of this week, Pokemon Shuffle (I like it, but then I understand and am not tempted by the ease of the dodgy options, nor am I responsible for anyone who would be susceptible).My Argos purchases also Included Dead Or Alive Dimensions and Super Street Fighter IV and they too take a toll (DOA’s diabolical story mode on the brain, mostly!).  I like both but would just make the observation that in the three months it’s taken to get a StreetPass hit for Street Fighter, I’ve had forty-seven jiggling ones… Mr Graham Addressing The NationGC: If you already have the Wii version there’s really no reason at all to get Xenoblade Chronicles 3D. Unless you desperately want to play it on the toilet.
The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, has debunked claims by the Presidential campaign of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the party is leading in 23 states of the federation.The INEC Chairman, Prof. Attahiru Jega dismissed the claim by the PDP, stressing that collation of results had only been collated in two states, including Ekiti State, adding that, “except more states have finished collation while we are in this hall.”Jega stated this while addressing a press conference at the international Conference Centre said, “You will have to direct the question to the person who said that (claim of victory in 23 states).“And I think you should be careful of such information from people that are partisan,” Mr. Jega said.He also warned against unofficial announcement of results.“Only INEC can declare winners,” he said.The Media. Director of the presidential campaign, Chief Femi Fani-kayode had said that ,”As we speak now, we are winning in 23 states and we have 64 percent while the APC is winning in 14 states and has 36 percent. These results are subject to confirmation by the Independent National Electoral Commission”.Fani Kayode said that the reports that PDP are getting from the field are that President Jonathan is doing very well in the south and north central and that the PDP are making very strong inroads into various states in the core north.He similarly accused the All Progressive Congress (APC) for aligning itself with some media houses to post fake election results on the net.He made the accusation yesterday while briefing the press on the results being peddled on the social media that his party and prominent members are losing in their polling units to the APC.According to Fani-Kayode, who described the attitude as nonsensical, absurd and childish added that the PDPAS of today is in control of 23 states representing 64 percent of the votes cast across the country.Fani-kayode asserts that, “the level of disinformation and falsehood that is being peddled around by the friends of the opposition in the media and particularly their paid agents and associates on the social media about the results of Saturdays elections”.He said, “Since yesterday afternoon they have been releasing fake results and they have been attempting to mislead the Nigerian people and our friends in the international community”.According to him, “The public have been inundated with lie after lie about the APC’s so-called victories in virtually every single polling booth, ward, local government area and state in the country. This is not only nonsensical but it is also far-fetched, absurd and childish”.He alleged that, “two opposition media houses and their associates in the social media went as far as to shamelessly claim that President Goodluck Jonathan lost in my polling unit and in my ward in Ile-Ife, when in actual fact the President not only won in my polling booth and ward but he also won in virtually every other ward in the four local government areas of Ile Ife in Osun state where I come from”.“The dirty lies that these two media houses have told is just one example of the gross and irresponsible mendacities and falsehood that the agents and associates of the APC habitually enjoy peddling. As we have always said, they are a party of liars that are led and inspired by a small cabalistic cult of shameful deceivers, liars and cheap propaganda merchants. In them there is no truth and lying is their second nature and natural habitat”.For example, “they claimed that Senator Musiliu Obanikoro who is presently the Honorable Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Senator Iyiola Omisore, the leader of our party in Osun state, Governor Olusegun Mimiko, the Governor of Ondo state, Senator David Mark, the Senate President, and so many other of our highly esteemed and respected leaders also lost their polling units and wards to General Muhammadu Buhari and the APC candidates for the various elections”.Needless to say, ” these claims by the APC are not only false but they are also absurd and nauseating. Such mendacities are indicative of the fact that they have lost touch with reality as we have always suspected. As a matter of fact we are surprised that they didn’t claim that the President himself also lost in his polling unit and ward and that he in fact voted for Buhari rather than for himself. Such is their level of depravity and deceit that they will manufacture any lie and assert any falsehood just to gain an edge and feed their vain delusions”He explained that the motive for the lies and disinformation of the APC is to create high expectations for their supporters so that when the real results come out and they are announced by INEC, and when those real results do not tally with the fake results that the APC had told their agents and friends to release, they will begin to run riot, create havoc and kill people.
Unknown gunmen yesterday morning at about 6 am in a convoy of over ten vehicles attacked many polling units in Kirfi, Alkaleri LGA of Bauchi State and destroyed many electoral materials.It could be recalled that on Saturday unknown gunmen in about six vehicles attacked a polling unit at Yautara ward in Darazo LGA and set ablaze electoral materials.The Bauchi state Police Command Public Relation Officer, DSP Haruna Mohammed who confirmed the incidence said unspecified number of unknown gunmen in a convoy of over ten vehicles stormed many polling units in Kirfi, Alkaleri LGA and destroyed many electoral materials.According to her, hoodlums further attacked Kirfi and Alkaleri divisional police headquarters, but were repelled and pursued towards Dindima town along Bauchi Gombe road.The public relation officer said, “Combined security forces comprising the police and army forced the hoodlums to abandon their mission and escaped into the bush”.Meanwhile the DSP Haruna pointed out that operations are still ongoing. The entire surroundings has been cordoned off by combined security forces and effort is being intensified to restore normalcy in the area. Members of the public are urged to remain calm and disregard rumour from mischief makers.A reliable source who is a resident said, “The gunmen stormed the town early morning of today and attacked Alkaleri divisional police station, INEC office and central primary school which was made as the collation center of Saturday’s election in the LGA.A reliable source at the district head of Alkaleri also confirmed the attack. He said they came in four Hilux firing sporadic shots and people scampered for safety, many could not come out from their house.He said, “The gunmen asked them not to panic, according to him, they have no intention to harm anybody, after the destruction they left for Bauchi, because they took Bauchi road”.
A man has been charged with a string of robberies across Sydney after he was arrested while allegedly holding a fake gun just metres from the Lindt cafe in Martin Place, police say.Officers from Sydney City Local Area Command were patrolling George Street about 2pm on Sunday when they were told there was a man carrying what appeared to be a firearm in the busy thoroughfare.Witnesses said they heard police yelling at the man: "Where is the gun?" while they searched his backpack and pockets.Police will allege the 54-year-old was carrying a replica firearm inside a plastic bag.The man was arrested about 400 metres from the cafe where Tori Johnson, 34, and Katrina Dawson, 38, were killed during the siege in December last year.Hostage taker Man Haron Monis also died. A total of 17 people were held hostage inside the popular cafe during the siege. The Lindt cafe reopened for business on March 20.The man arrested on Sunday afternoon was taken to Day Street police station and charged with eight counts of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon.Police will allege in court that the robberies occurred in the Sydney metropolitan area between February 27 and March 29.In each robbery, the man allegedly used a semi-automatic pistol and sometimes wore a surgical mask.Police also searched a home in Truman Street in South Hurstville on Sunday night and seized a pair of shoes and clothing.The man was refused police bail and is due to appear at Central Local Court on Monday.
Early results collated have indicated that the All Progressives Congress (APC) is coasting to victory in Sokoto state.As the time filling this report, the party was leading in three local government areas so far announced late last night.The APC presidential candidate, General Muhammadu Buhari won the three local government areas with wide margin as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission’s local government collation officers.The state has no fewer than twenty-three local government councils with Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and APC being the two major parties in the contest.The results indicated that Buhari got 25,286; Jonathan polled 5,339 votes in Kware LGA.In Dange/Shuni, Buhari polled 31,036 votes and Jonathan got 6,918; in Goronyo LGA, Buhari polled 28,950, Jonathan 7,664.In the same vein, unofficial results also indicated that the incumbent governor, Alhaji Aliyu Magatakarda Wamakko who contested for the Sokoto Central Senatorial seat defeated the serving senator, Alhaji Ahmed Muhammad Maccido of PDP.Also defeated is the incumbent member of the Sokoto South/North federal constituency, Hon. Umaru Bature who lost to APC candidate, Alhaji Bala Abubakar III.However, the collation officers disclosed that only the APC polling agents signed the results, while the PDP’s agents declined to sign the result sheets.

The German World Cup winner, who is out of contract at the end of the season, is available on a free transfer.He’s held talks with Schalke over a deal, but reports in Spain say Chelsea are looking to hijack the move and haven’t given up hope of signing him.Khedira is looking for a £100,000-a-week contract at his next club, and the Blues would be able to pay that easily.Arsenal have previously been linked with the 27-year-old and tried hard to sign him last summer.MORE: Man United AGREE to pay release clause to sign £75m star
I am from Bristol and am studying psychology at Oxford Brookes University.Psychology is definitely my passion; I love researching into how minds work and into how we all make decisions, but I particularly love learning about how we all connect with one another, whether it's within a family or throughout society.Apart from meeting new people and making friends, I am really looking forward to learning about politics and the way our government works through BBC Generation 2015.I hope I can encourage other young people to also get more interested and involved in the way our country is run.
قال زعيم حزب الديمقراطيين الأحرار، نك كليغ، إن الاقتصاد البريطاني قد "يؤذي نفسه" إذا انفصلت بريطانيا عن الاتحاد الأوروبي وإن الخطوة قد تهدد تعافي الاقتصاد.وأضاف كليغ أن الكثير من أعضاء حزب المحافظين وحزب الاستقلال البريطاني يسعون إلى فصل انجلترا عن "أكبر سوق في العالم".وأن أعضاء حزبه لا يخفون دعمهم للاتحاد الأوروبي، لكنهم يتمسكون بإجراء استفتاء على كل انتقال كبير في السلطات.وجاءت تصريحات كليغ في مقاطعة أوكسفوردشير، وهي إحدى أهم المقاطعات التي يسعى حزبه للفوز فيها واستعادة المقعد من شركائه في الائتلاف الحكومي. وكان قد وصل إلى المقاطعة في "حافلة المعركة" الصفراء الخاصة بالحزب.وقال: "لدينا آراء تختلف تماما عن المحافظين. إن الكثيرون من أعضاء حزب المحافظين يسعون للانفصال عن الاتحاد الأوروبي وهو أمر شديد السوء بالنسبة للاقتصاد البريطاني".وأضاف أنه لا يتفق مع حزب العمال "وفشله في إحداث توازن في الميزانية. وأفزعتني حاجة حزب العمال لاقتراض 70 مليار جنيه استرليني، ونرى أنها أكثر من الحاجة".وتأتي تصريحات كليغ بعد تصريحات الوزير إد دايفي، من الديمقراطيين الأحرار، التي قال فيها إن التزام رئيس الوزراء، ديفيد كاميرون، بإجراء استفتاء على البقاء في الاتحاد الأوروبي بنهاية عام 2017 يجعل تكوين ائتلاف آخر مع حزب المحافظين "أمرا شديد الصعوبة".وأعلن حزب العمال البريطاني أنه لن يجري مثل هذا الاستفتاء إلا حدث اختلاف في ميزان القوى بين لندن وبروكسل.

With his country embattled in conflict, Yemen President Hadi calls the Shiite group, which has taken over large parts of the country, Iranian "puppets." (Reuters)With his country embattled in conflict, Yemen President Hadi calls the Shiite group, which has taken over large parts of the country, Iranian "puppets." (Reuters)Arab leaders announced on Sunday that they would form a joint military force to intervene in neighboring states grappling with armed insurgencies. It is a dramatic step to quell the unrest that has broken out in the wake of the region's uprisings, but some analysts warned it could exacerbate the conflicts that have polarized countries and left hundreds of thousands dead.The announcement at a summit of Arab leaders in Egypt came as warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition carried out scores of airstrikes across Yemen overnight Saturday and Sunday, the fourth day of a campaign against Shiite rebels known as Houthis. That coordinated operation, involving mostly Arab countries, could represent a prototype for future joint Arab military interventions in the region.Arab officials said they still need to hammer out the details of the proposed joint force, but broader questions remain over the ability of Arab countries — many of which have killed scores of their own citizens — to stem the region’s wars through military action. Arab armies, while well-equipped, are largely untested and ill-trained in fighting guerrilla-style conflicts with rebel forces such as the Houthis. From Yemen to Libya to the battlefields of Syria, armed groups have exploited fresh violence to seize power or rout rivals. The result has been deepening polarization and rising death tolls across the region.“Without a component for political dialogue, this force will be ineffective and even detrimental” to the region, said Abdel Salam Nasia, an independent member of Libya’s parliament who attended the summit in Egypt.Last month, Egyptian fighter jets carried out airstrikes against militant targets in eastern Libya after jihadists beheaded 20 Egyptian Christians there. Egypt then called for a broader intervention to battle Libya’s militant Islamist groups but was rebuffed by U.S. and U.N. officials seeking a negotiated end to Libya’s violence.Speaking at the summit Sunday, in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Yemeni Foreign Minister Riyadh Yassin scoffed at government talks with the Houthis, and said that the Saudi-led offensive has been “extremely successful.”“The operation will end when Yemen is safe and secure. But we will only negotiate with those who are willing to disarm,” he said. “We won’t negotiate with [the Houthis] because they carried out a coup. They used the state’s weakness to take over.”Saudi Arabia intervened in Yemen after the Houthis toppled the government and captured vast tracts of territory in recent weeks.The Arab League chief, Nabil al-Araby, said on Sunday that the joint force would be deployed at the request of any Arab nation facing a security threat, including from terrorist groups. A panel of regional security officials would meet in the coming months to draw up the size, structure, and budget of the force, he said. Member states have proposed a 40,000-strong force backed by fighter jets, warships and light armor, the Associated Press reported, citing Egyptian security officials.Arab officials said the region’s unprecedented threats have made a joint security regime necessary. Indeed, a wave of uprisings beginning in 2010 deposed at least four Arab leaders after decades of authoritarian rule. But the pro-democracy revolts were soon overtaken by political chaos and the proliferation of armed factions seeking to capitalize on the instability.“The challenges facing Arab national security are immense,” Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi said at the closing session of the Arab League summit on Sunday. Sissi said the decision to establish a combined military force “defends our [Arab] nation … and gives it an active role in the future of human civilization.”In Yemen Sunday, the streets of the Houthi-controlled capital Sanaa were empty for fear of renewed airstrikes, residents said. In the northern Houthi stronghold of Saada, there were unconfirmed reports that airstrikes had destroyed power plants, depriving the province of electricity. Warplanes also struck Sana’a’s airport and the port at Hodeida, crippling Yemen’s already weak infrastructure.Yet even as Saudi officials said they had not ruled out invading Yemen with ground troops, analysts warned of the perils of sending inexperienced armed forces into a country with rugged mountain peaks and severe water shortages. Such a ground force would also struggle against battle-hardened Houthi fighters who are now the most competent fighters in Yemen. The country’s military has fallen apart because of splits over loyalties and now the Saudi attacks.Yezid Sayigh, senior associate at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, said that Saudi forces lack experience in mounting large ground offensives.“There are all sorts of potential pitfalls” that would accompany a ground incursion in Yemen, he said.“The whole point is that the Houthis have demonstrated that other fighting forces are disorganized, leaderless, and thus these forces collapsed in the face of Houthi assaults,” he said.Egypt, too, commands a sizeable army, but that has struggled to battle a years-long insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula. Its forces have also been attacked on the border with Libya, causing some of the highest casualties among Egyptian troops since the war with Israel in 1973.“We are wary of military intervention, and we hope the Arab League can provide checks” on the forces leading the push for joint Arab assaults, said Dhia al-Dabbass, Iraq’s permanent delegate to the Arab League.“The politics of the region are too complex,” he said. “There is no reason why negotiation should not take precedent.”Habib reported from Sharm el-Sheikh.

Caltex Australia shares dived 9.25 per cent in early trading on Monday in response to Chevron's sudden $4.73 billion exit from the share register, which some analysts said could herald a new more aggressive phase of acquisitions for the fuels refiner and marketer.Shares in Caltex slid as low as $34.38, below the $35 a share that institutional investors paid for the shares over the weekend.The stock is still up 56 per cent over the past 12 months, with investors welcoming the changes Caltex has made to its business as it streamlines refining and moves the emphasis of its business to fuel distribution and retailing.Chief financial officer Simon Hepworth on Sunday suggested that Chevron's exit would open up options for the company to consider distributing its $1.1 billion franking credit balance, but he played down the impact of the move on the company's overall strategy.However, Macquarie Securities said the departure of Chevron as a 50 per cent shareholder provided Caltex with more scope to pursue acquisitions, potentially involving an equity raising.With a current balance sheet capacity of between $750 million and $950 million within its BBB+ credit rating, Caltex could make an acquisition worth more than $1 billion, Macquarie said.Caltex chief executive Julian Segal last month pointed to ambitions for further acquisitions to leverage off the company's strength in marketing and retailing. It pointed to potential acquisitions to fill gaps in its network or to expand in geographic areas where it was under-represented.Chevron's exit could now accelerate that."While Chevron's presence was not necessarily a hindrance to this strategy, more transformational transactions where there could have been a conflict of interest with Chevron or where further equity issuance could be required, could now also be considered by the board & management," Macquarie said in a note.Meanwhile, Chevron's sale is likely to fuel demand from index funds because Caltex's weighting in the ASX100 and ASX200 indices will increase, Macquarie noted."With a number of recent blocks offered at narrow discounts, this could be viewed as an option for more active investors who are sitting on large cash balances to secure a market weight in what will now be a more material index stock at a reasonable discount which offers a reasonable, defensive yield," it said.Goldman Sachs underwrote the sale of Chevron's 135 million shares in Caltex at $34.20 a share. However, Chevron eventually received $35 a share for its stake, giving the deal a total value of $4.73 billion, rather than the $4.62 billion at the underwritten sale price.Confirming the completion of the sale on Monday, Chevron said it would receive the cash proceeds once settlement took place on April 2 and the gain would be recorded in its second quarter results.
Soon enough, the Lakers will be free to do whatever they want.Hit the beach. Vacation in Europe. Head to their hometowns.Between now and April 15, Coach Byron Scott can only hope to keep a lid on a quickly dissolving season, the latest setback a 107-99 Lakers loss to the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday.It was dull, it was bland and it ended the way so many games had this season.Sensing the need for a pick-me-up, Scott tried his best to incentivize the players, many of them holding expiring contracts."I understand that this late in the season, guys get to the point where they're frustrated and minds start to wander and you start thinking about the summer and all that stuff," he said. "But we're in a situation right now where the guys that we have, they still have to look up at the future. Everybody's getting evaluated. To me, these last 10 games are the most important."The Lakers' loss wasn't a big deal to their fans-turned-lottery-enthusiasts. In fact, it set up the biggest game so far in this upside-down season.The Lakers (19-53) play at Philadelphia on Monday, the 76ers (18-56) right below them in the standings. A Lakers loss would set up quite the battle of ineptitude over the final two weeks.The Lakers have a 10.5% chance of winning the No. 1 pick at the May 19 lottery, and the 76ers, keepers of the NBA's third-worst record, hold a 15.6% chance.Equally important, if the Lakers managed to fall below the 76ers and finish with the NBA's third-worst record, they would forfeit their draft pick only if three teams passed them on lottery night. There's a mere 4% chance of that happening. If the Lakers stay where they are now, there's a 16% chance of getting passed by two teams on lottery night.The Lakers traded this year's first-round pick as part of the Steve Nash deal in 2012, but it is top-five protected.As for Sunday's game, Jordan Clarkson came relatively close to another triple-double — 18 points, seven assists and six rebounds — but the Lakers couldn't stop Brook Lopez, who had 30 points and 11 rebounds for the Nets.Jeremy Lin sat out because of an upper-respiratory infection, which was unfortunate for spectators who came to Barclays Center for the Nets' "Celebration of Chinese Culture" day.Jordan Hill had 22 points and 16 rebounds after returning from a three-game absence so the Lakers could, allegedly, evaluate younger players. But a young and healthy Ed Davis did not play Sunday, and neither did Carlos Boozer, yet again.The Lakers are as bad as the worst team in franchise history, the 1957-58 Minneapolis Lakers, who had a 19-53 record. They played only 72 games then, meaning these Lakers must win three of their final 10 to avoid finishing with a worse winning percentage.With the off-season so close, the Lakers are walking quickly toward history's embrace.
Senegal continued their dominance over Ghana with a 2-1 win on Saturday night thanks to a brace from substitute Moussa Konate.The international friendly played at the Stade Oceane du Le Havre was high in quality as Aliou Cisse won his first match in-charge.The two sides were meeting for the second time in two months after a Group B clash in Mongomo which Senegal won by the same scoreline.Striker Demba Ba should have shot ahead on six minutes when Sadio Mane put him through.The Besiktas man wriggled past his man and fired a low grounder, which beat goalkeeper RazakBrimah, but the lower side post denied him.Ghana continued to push and thought they deserved a penalty when striker, Kwesi Appiah was fouled inside the box but the referee waived for play to continue.Defender John Boye profited from a flick on header inside the box and fired from close range but his shot went awry.Earlier, Appiah fought his way into the box and fired but his shot was blocked. Stand-in captain Andre Ayew followed up with a shot but that was wide.The second half belonged to Ghana who were slightly on top with some steel play and attacking moves.Andre cut in from the left and approach the box before sending in a cross which just aboveBut against the run of play striker Moussa Konate put the Teranga Lions ahead on the 66 minutes just five minutes after coming on for Demba Ba.It was a long ball from defence which found the FC Sion man, who chested and volleyed over goalkeeper Brimah, off his line.Ghana tried to make amends and mounted a search for the leveller but they got exposed at the back and another defence-splitting pass found from midfielder picked out Mane on the left.The Southampton man took his charge and laid a pass to the right to find an unmarked Konate who slotted home for the second.Substitute Richmond Boakye-Yiadom reduced the deficit when he powerfully headed down a prosaic cross from Harrison Afful’s weaker left foot from the right in the 84th minute.The Atalanta man had spent four minutes on the pitch after replacing Appiah.Ghana tried to snatch the equalizer but Senegal were tough and thwarted everything thrown at them.The Black Stars will play Mali next on Tuesday in Paris and Senegal engage Ligue 2 side Le Havre.
Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond believes a top-four finish in the Aviva Premiership is out of the Sharks' reach and is focusing on securing European Champions Cup qualification.Tries from Johnny Leota and Josh Beaumont, as well as 13 points from Danny Cipriani, saw the Manchester outfit defeat Gloucester 23-6 at the AJ Bell Stadium and move them to within one point of Wasps in sixth.A top-six finish would give Sale a direct place in next season's premier European competition.With three winnable matches against London Irish, Harlequins and Newcastle Falcons coming up, a top-four berth and play-off spot appear to be a possibility, but Diamond does not think that it is a realistic target."The first goal is to qualify for the Champions Cup and we want to finish in sixth to do that," he said. "We'll just try to win every game. If we do then we will finish in the top six, but I do think the top four is a bit away from us and we're probably just off that."We've not got a squad that can compete with the top four, but at home we're a good side and it's difficult (to come here) as we've proven against Gloucester, Northampton and Saracens."The run-in for us is good for the fact that we get a rest after every week and, with the ageing squad that we've got, it gives them time to recover."Diamond also paid tribute to Mark Cueto, a one-club man who made his 300th appearance for the team versus the Cherry and Whites.He added: "In the team talk, there were no tactics discussed. It was all about Beaumont, Ross Harrison, Tommy Taylor, Cliffy (Will Cliff) - all these kids that have taken the same route."They started at 17 or 18 and Cuets did the same thing 15 years ago and he put his 300th shirt on today. It doesn't happen to many people."He puts the same endeavour, the same enthusiasm into his 300th game as he did his first one. If those young lads who played today follow him, then maybe they will play for England."As for Gloucester, they succumbed once again in Manchester against the Sharks - a team they have not beaten away from home since 2001.And, having only scored six points in the match through two James Hook penalties, director of rugby David Humphreys admitted their display was not acceptable."I was most disappointed with the performance," Humphreys said. "Over the last few weeks we would say as a team and as a squad we've performed pretty well for most of the time."We haven't always got the result we felt we deserved, but there have been certain parts of our game around the energy we bring to our defence and attack, the enthusiasm that has been there and you can never question the heart."I don't think today was about questioning any of that - it's just that it wasn't there in the first half. Setting aside the result, we felt that was the most disappointing aspect after a very positive training week."
We'll be first to admit that The Walking Dead season 5 didn't initially grip us.The survivors wandering aimlessly through abandon towns, foraging for scraps following the death of Beth wasn't exactly must-see TV, especially for a post-apocalyptic US horror many love.Like any fan of TWD, we kept our faith, and we were right to do so as there is about to be a big pay off.Since the mid-season break the series has picked up rapidly and so has character development.The likes of Glenn, Sasha and Michonne have a reason to watch them - and the writers have even given Carl a storyline.But like all good things on The Walking Dead, the bloody remains of the series must come to an end.How will the series end?After episode 15 'Try' we don't know what is going on. Rick has changed before a sword-less Michonne nearly took his head off with THAT punch.Carol has changed and so has Maggie - following Beth's departure that was bound to happen.So these are the things that NEED to happen in the finale to keep us sweet.Chandler Riggs as Carl Grimes and Danai Gurira as MichonneYes she is clearly good at knocking people out with one punch.Yes, she looked the part with that sheriff jacket and YES she can most certainly look after herself without her massive sword. But whose side is she on? As one of the first survivors to want to stay at Alexandria she has shown signs of wavering in terms of her alliance with the originals - does she want to stay THAT much?Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes and Corey Brill as PeteWas it us or has ol' Mr Grimes gone a little potty?She could have jumped in at ANY time! And now Pete gets to carry on doing whatever he was doing. Abusing his family with no consequences.Watch the trailer above which sees everyone give Rick the dirtiest of looks as he walks through the town.Sorry, words like this "They'll find us and they'll try to kill us but we'll kill them" in the trailer, simply mean a major character is saying goodbye in the last episode.Tyler James Williams as Noah and Steven Yeun as Glenn RheeOK, last week saw Michonne give Rick a right hook he'll never forget but Glenn didn't do anything to that coward Nicholas.It's his fault we no longer sing 'Everybody Hates Chris' during an episode, sort it out Glenn.Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon and Ross Marquand as AaronTell us what the 'W' means already!Sonequa Martin-Green as Sasha and Steven Yeun as Glenn Rhee in The Walking DeadOK, so something major is going to happen tonight.We don't know what but we know it's going to be big.Whatever happens as long as they end with a nice preview for season 6 we don't mind. NO OPEN-ENDED CLIFFHANGERS.They're going to give us an open-ended cliffhanger aren't they?* The Walking Dead airs on Fox UK at 9pm on Monday 30 March
Researchers in Denmark have revealed how porpoises finely adjust the beams of sound they use to hunt.The animals hunt with clicks and buzzes - detecting the echoes from their prey.This study showed them switching from a narrow to a wide beam of sound - "like adjusting a flashlight" - as they homed in on a fish.Researchers think that other whales and dolphins may use the same technique to trap a fish in their beam of sound in the final phase of an attack.This could help prevent porpoises, whales and dolphins' prey from evading their capture.By revealing these acoustic secrets in detail, researchers are hoping to develop ways to prevent porpoises, and other toothed whales, from becoming trapped in fishing nets.The study, published in the journal eLife, was led by Danuta Wisniewska of Aarhus University.She and her colleagues worked with harbour porpoises in a semi-natural enclosure on the coast of Denmark."The facility is quite exceptional, " explained Dr Wisniewska. "The animals still have access to the seafloor and are only separated from the harbour by a net. Fish are able to come in, so they're still hunting."In this unique environment, the researchers were able to fit the porpoises with sound-detecting tags, and to place an array of microphones to pick up sound around their enclosure.The team carried out a series of these experiments to work out where the sound energy the porpoises produced was being directedIn one experiment, researchers dropped fish into the water to tempt the porpoises to hunt.As echolocating porpoises, whales and dolphins hunt, they switch from an exploratory clicking to a more intense, high frequency buzz - to elicit a continuous echo from the fish they are pursuing.Their beam can be envisaged a cone of sound, said Dr Wisniewska, comparing it to the cone-shaped beam of light from a torch.•Toothed whales and dolphins, collectively known as odontocetes, use echolocation to hunt and navigate•Echolocating clicks pass through a fatty structure at the front of their skull called the melon. It is this structure that forms a visible bulge on the animal's head and researchers say it acts as an adjustable acoustic lens, focusing the sound into a beam and altering the size of that beam•Other non-echolocating marine mammals have different tricks for finding their way underwater. Seals, for example, have super-sensitive whiskers, which can detect the fattest fish by sensing the trail they leave behind"If you were trying to find your car in a car park, you could use a narrow beam over a long distance and still see a lot," she explained."But when you're trying to get your keys into the car, you would switch to a wider beam."This is similar to what we see in porpoises."According to this study, the porpoises were able to broaden their beam by as much as 50% in the final phase of their attack. And they were able to switch between a narrow and a wide beam.This fine-tuning ability is controlled by a fatty structure in their forehead, called the melon, which acts as a sort of "sound lens".The harbour porpoises involved in this study came to the harbourside facility having been rescued after being caught in fishing nets. And the researchers hope this work will help develop ways of using sound to prevent porpoises from accidentally chasing fish into these nets."My research suggests that they really attend to their target, so we could be seeing a sort of attention blindness," said Dr Wisniewska, explaining that porpoises might be so intently focused on the one fish they are hunting that they ignore their surroundings while they pursue it into a net.Sufficiently loud and repetitive underwater sounds - emitted from fisheries - could help alert porpoises, whales and dolphins to the presence of a fishing net, and help keep them away.
As prisons go, the famed Beau-Rivage hotel nestled on the Swiss side of Lake Geneva with breath-taking views over the snow-capped French Alps must count as one of the world's most luxurious.But after six days and nights of living within the confines of its magnificent 19th century frescos and marbled columns, even top diplomats were beginning to go a bit stir crazy as they seek to hammer out a historic framework deal with Iran."Don't you guys have a life?" top US diplomat John Kerry joked with journalists who mobbed him as he left a dinner in one of the hotel's top-class restaurants late Monday with his French and German counterparts.But he swiftly corrected himself, saying reporters had a "better life" than the negotiators.Not only have they been debating, arguing, discussing, dining and even breakfasting together, but it has been virtually impossible to leave the hotel without being chased by camera crews from the world's media desperate for a snippet of information.Despite the cold, rainy weather, Kerry did manage to take at least one of his famous bike rides during a break in negotiations, and slipped in to join a birthday party at a nearby bar.And a video of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi jogging along the banks of the lake caused a storm on social networks in China, where the private lives of politicians are rarely reported on.Opened in 1861, the Beau-Rivage, with its 168 guest rooms including 26 junior suites and eight suites, has hosted a few historic events in its day.And many of the 20th century's most famous personalities -- Victor Hugo, Marilyn Monroe, Coco Chanel and Tina Turner to name just a few -- have passed through its halls.The former dictator of Zaire, Mobutu Sese Seko, spent several months in the hotel in 1996, reportedly running up a bill of $1 million, before he left, fleeing into exile in Morocco where he died the following year.Managing the safety of top delegations from seven countries has posed a logistical and security headache for the Swiss authorities.During these closed-doors negotiations, a system of coloured badges has ensured that reporters have had little access into the heart of the hotel, roped in a gilded cage of a sumptuous ballroom resplendent with chandeliers.Even journalists staying in the hotel were barred from their rooms at times, and had to negotiate past guards on every floor.For the delegations who have led the intense talks -- and the media who have followed them since 2013 -- it has become a familiar scene.Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad have criss-crossed the globe in their hunt for a deal which would pare back Iran's nuclear programme in exchange of an easing of crippling global sanctions.But their journeys have always led them back to Europe -- and most regularly to Switzerland, which has jealously guarded its neutrality down the centuries.The cachet of agreeing a landmark nuclear deal on Swiss territory is not lost on the delegations -- notably the Iranians who have been left diplomatically isolated by their escalating nuclear programme.Unconfirmed rumours have circulated for days that if anything is agreed, all the delegations could make the hour-long drive to Geneva to announce it within the solemn halls of the UN's Palais des Nations.That was the home of the League of Nations, created in 1920 in the wake of World War 1 as the first international body whose mission was to maintain peace through collective security and disarmament.With the talks nearing the witching hour Tuesday, many in Lausanne were beginning to tire of living in such close proximity and the feverish speculation."I feel like I'm in a Wes Anderson movies," one American reporter said, referring to the director behind such films as the Oscar-winning "Grand Budapest Hotel."

With 22 kids that carry his surname, 18 who don’t and “probably a few more” out there, the 56-year-old keeps track of his offspring by tattooing their names across his back.“I’m as fertile as sin,” said the ‘serial dad’, whose kids are aged between three and 37. “I don’t believe in contraception and I love sex.”Dubbed “Britain’s most feckless father”, Mr Holpin insists he loves all his children even though most were removed by children’s services.“Due to my drinking and my womanising, most of my kids have gone through the care system,” Mr Holpin, who has been sober for five years, told a UK documentary team.“It makes me feel like s**t because they’ve suffered. They [social services] took them from me because I’m an alcoholic.”Mr Holpin now wants to reunite his huge brood.“When they went into care, I made a promise that no matter how long it took, I will get my kids home,” he said.“I miss all the fun we used to have so I guess getting them back, my life will be set. My life will be perfect.”But that’s not all — the baby-maker wants even more children.“I’m only 56. I’ll never stop [having children]. Never stop. In the Bible, God says go forth and multiply.

The No. 6 Nazi on the Simon Wiesenthal Center list of most wanted war criminal has died a free man in Germany at age 93.Soren Kam, a Dane who served with the Nazis and met Adolf Hitler, escaped from Denmark to Germany, which refused to extradite him after he was granted citizenship in 1956.“The fact that Soren Kam, a totally unrepentant Nazi murderer, died a free man in Kempten is a terrible failure of the Bavarian judicial authorities,” the center’s chief Nazi hunter, Dr. Efraim Zuroff, said in a statement.“Kam should have finished his miserable life in jail, whether in Denmark or Germany. The failure to hold him accountable will only inspire the contemporary heirs of the Nazis to consider following in his footsteps.”SS officer Soren Kam was wanted for the 1943 kidnap and murder of anti-Nazi newspaper editor Carl Henrik Clemmensen, whose bullet-riddled body was found on a roadside after he was seized from his home by three men.“The unarmed Clemmensen was killed by eight gunshots fired simultaneously from three pistols at virtual point blank range,” says the blog Aktive Modstandsfolk.A Danish court case conducted after the war convicted him in absentia of the murder. Another Danish SS men, Knud Flemming Helweg-Larsen, was convicted for his role in the murder and executed in 1946. A third culprit disappeared after the war.Denmark also wanted to talk to Kam about the theft in 1943 of a population register, later used to round up and deport 500 Danish Jews to concentration camps.In 1999 Denmark requested the extradition of Kam, which Germany refused due to his German citizenship, the Simon Wiesenthal Center said. Munich courts in 2007 dismissed attempts under a European Union arrest warrant to deport him to Denmark on the grounds that Clemmensen’s death was not murder but manslaughter, which fell under a statue of limitation.Kam fought on the Eastern Front with the Waffen SS and was granted the Knight’s Cross medal by Adolf Hitler in 1945 for his leadership of Danish SS men against the resistance of his countrymen.“He was a fanatical Nazi and one of the highest-profile Danish Nazis during the war,” historian Claus Bundgård Christensen told DR Nyheder. “He was a star that Nazi children and young people looked up to.”Christensen said that Nazi youth publications often used pictures of Kam as propaganda for recruiting young people to the Eastern Front and he became an international star whose autograph was sought by Nazi sympathizers.“He was very active, and it was only in recent years when his health began to fail that he began to retreat from the public eye,” he said.The Daily Telegraph tracked down former SS-Obersturmfuehrer Søren Kam to a peaceful town near Munich in 2007.In Bavaria, Kam, a man who met Adolf Hitler, lives openly. By his doorbell is a traditional Bavarian clay plaque, made by his grandchildren, and bearing the family name. Kam responded to knocks on his front door by opening his front window and hiding behind the curtains. All that could be seen was his hand, but the voice of the SS man remained clear and dismissive. “I know who you are. I don’t want to talk to you. Leave me in peace,” he said, before slamming the window.Kam died on March 23, about two weeks after his wife, according to a death note in the German paper Allgauer Zeitung.
OTTAWA — British Columbia MP James Lunney is quitting the Conservative caucus so that he can more freely defend his religious beliefs.Lunney says he’s leaving voluntarily so as not to entangle his Tory colleagues in controversy over his beliefs regarding evolution.He says he’ll sit as an Independent but will continue to vote with the ruling Conservatives.Lunney says his decision was sparked by reaction to remarks he made earlier this month, which he says were inflated by the media and became part of a firestorm of condemnation surrounding two Ontario politicians who do not believe in the theory of evolution.He says the reaction showed ignorance and intolerance, cloaked in a defence of science.In a statement, Lunney maintains there are deliberate attempts to suppress a Christian world view in the senior levels of politics.
Emergency workers in Indian Kashmir have recovered 16 bodies including that of a three-week-old baby after a landslide triggered by heavy rains buried several houses.The baby was found in his mother's lap under several tons of mud, police said today, as the grim task of searching for bodies continued.The victims all belonged to two families who after the rains had moved into what they thought was the stronger of two houses in Ladden village, 20 miles west of Kashmir's main city Srinagar.'We have recovered 15 bodies. Efforts are on to find a missing boy who was also in the house,' local superintendent of police Fayaz Ahmed Lone said today. Since the statement police confirmed that a 16th body had been recoveredHe said a sole survivor of the landslide had refused to leave his house, and was now 'so shocked that he is not able to talk'.Yesterday's landslide hit as authorities issued a flood warning for Kashmir after the River Jhelum which runs through Srinagar rose above the danger level.Homes in Srinagar were flooded for the second time in less than a year, and one man was washed away when he tried to cross a flash flood in his car elsewhere in the state.With more rain forecast in the next three days, authorities said the danger was not over.The state's top official Gazanfar Hussain said the river level was falling in most parts of the region but lakes downstream were already full, posing a possible flood danger.Memories are still fresh of the devastating floods that hit Kashmir last September, killing hundreds.Tens of thousands of people were left stranded when floods and landslides triggered by heavy monsoon rains devastated parts of the Indian-administered section of Kashmir and Pakistan's neighbouring Punjab province.On the Indian side of the border alone, the floods killed around 300 people, left thousands more homeless and destroyed property and infrastructure worth an estimated $16 billion.Some Srinagar residents have accused authorities of not doing enough to prevent a repeat of that disaster, which many said was exacerbated by the state government's failure to prepare for flooding.Today police said a special team set up to deal with the floods had received 30,000 calls and messages, while plans had been put in place to evacuate people from Srinagar.Relief camps have been set up in the city, which was severely hit by the 2014 flood disaster.Many shops remained shut in Srinagar on Tuesday, while traders in the main commercial district had moved their goods to safer places.Akram Sohail, chairman of the Disaster Management Authority in the Pakistan-administered section of Kashmir, said it had issued warnings not to get too close to the river.'We have also issued an alert for a further rise in water level because of heavy rains and flooding on the Indian side,' he told AFP.Elsewhere in India, fierce rain and lightning toppled houses and trees in Bihar state, killing 20 others.In eastern India, the Bihar state government said strong winds uprooted trees and many houses collapsed in the state capital, Patna, and in Purnia and Katihar districts.On the Pakistani side of the border, which was hit worse by last year's flooding, authorities said the situation was improving, although the Neelum and Jhelum Rivers were perilously close to overflowing their banks.'Both the rivers are still swollen,' said Akram Sohail, an official with the government disaster management department in the Pakistan-controlled portion of Kashmir.Heavy downpours over the past three days damaged several roads and disrupted transport, he said.An ancient region in the heart of the Himalayas, Kashmir as it is commonly known is divided between India and Pakistan - but the region is claimed by both countries.Two of the three wars the nations have fought since their independence from Britain in 1947 have been over control of the mountainous zone.However, relations improved slightly in recent years and each side has offered to help the other recover from the floods.The floods have been happening annually in Pakistan and were at their worst in recent memory in 2010, when 1,800 people died and 20 million were affected.In those floods 62,000 square miles of land were swamped - an area bigger than England.The deluge cost the Pakistan £6billion - a fifteenth of its total annual output.Analysts said last year's floods were not on the same scale as in 2010 but could match those in 2012, which killed almost 600 people and affected almost five million.
The lack of a deal further raises pressure on Athens, which faces the prospect of running out of money in a few weeks unless it can convince lenders to dole out more financial help.Athens put a brave face on the failure to reach an agreement with the "Brussels Group" of representatives from the EU and the IMF, saying it remained keen for a deal on the basis of its long-held demand that the measures it is asked to implement do not hurt economic growth. Lenders will intensify efforts to collect data in Athens, it said.One source close to the talks said the halt in negotiations was not a sign of a rupture but an indication of slow-moving progress in the discussions.Mistrust and acrimony have characterised much of Greece's talks with lenders since Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras stormed to power in January pledging to end austerity and a bailout programme that has kept Greece afloat for over four years.Greece and its European partners have sought to show publicly that relations have improved in recent weeks after Tsipras held a series of talks with EU leaders, but both sides remain far apart on issues ranging from pension reform to debt relief.At issue now is a list of reforms that Greece presented to the Brussels Group representatives last week, in an effort to show lenders that it is committed to living up to pledges of financial discipline and is worthy of aid.But euro zone officials panned the list as inadequate. One EU official said the lenders had yet to receive the list they had been waiting for.A conference call of the Euro Working Group - euro zone deputy finance ministers - remains scheduled for Wednesday and will allow the bloc to take stock of developments so far, an official said."We obviously look forward to receiving a list as soon as possible," the official said. "That's the aim of the ongoing discussions: to exchange information on detailed reform measures and intentions."The Brussels Groups makes recommendations to the Euro Working Group which in turn informs the Eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers who make decisions to disburse aid.Tsipras appealed on Monday for an "honest compromise" with lenders but warned it would not be won at any cost.Calling for support from opposition parties, Tsipras reiterated that his government would implement a Feb. 20 deal struck with the euro zone.But he also stressed that the government had non-negotiable "red lines" such as avoiding wage and pension cuts and mass layoffs, and avoiding a fire sale of asset sales in favour of concessions that allows the state to retain control.Separately, Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis met on Tuesday with officials from major bond fund manager Pimco, which has large investments in euro zone peripheral debt. Pimco officials expressed interest in Greek Treasury bill auctions and bonds, a finance ministry official said.
LOCAL charity Hugs From Henry has donated 150 Easter eggs to the children’s wards at Derriford Hospital.The kind donation comes after people across the city donated more than 600 chocolate eggs, which will be shared between Derriford Hospital, Jeremiah's Journey, Children's Hospice South West, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and CLIC Sargent, Homes from Home.Elsbeth Hallam, said she was delighted to be able to give back to those who helped five-year-old Henry when he was battling rare childhood cancer neuroblastoma.She said: “It gives us great pleasure to be able to give back to people that need it, after all of the kindness that people have shown to us.“I would like to thank the public for their generosity, I can’t believe the total amount that we received.“The Children and Young People's Outpatient Department at Derriford Hospital have been such a great support to my family.“They are a lovely team and are like an extended family to us. We now hope to be able to carry on giving back every year.”Helen Little, ward manager for Wildgoose and the Children and Young People's Outpatients Department said: “We would like to thank Hugs from Henry for their kindness.“Children really love receiving Easter eggs and it will be great to put a smile on their faces.”
There are many things about Stephen Sharper about which the Liberal party is envious.Two, he’s the Prime Minster instead of a Liberal.Three, he keeps getting re-elected prime minister over Liberals.All these are clear violations of the Liberal code, which holds that only Liberals are qualified to run anything above a hot dog stand. It’s reasonable enough to be upset on that account, but who would have believed the Liberals would be jealous of Stephen Harper’s artistic talents?Those talents are modest. Even Mr. Harper would probably admit that. After considerable coaxing from his wife, the prime minister agreed some years ago to let down his guard and share a secret with Canadians: he can play the piano a little, and sing, sort of. Mostly he sings oldies, particularly the Beatles, but also, on special occasions, Buddy Holly, Johnny Cash, John Denver (a very non-Conservative choice) and even Guns ‘n Roses, when he wants to pander to the base.His willingness to display his talents has always annoyed Liberals, who insist it’s part of a calculated effort to give the false impression he has human qualities. But it obviously goes beyond that.How else to explain their transparent attempt to show that Liberal leader Justin Trudeau also has an artistic bent that’s just as modest as Mr. Harper’s? Perhaps even more modest, judging by the evidence.The party is offering a “limited edition” sketch by Mr. Trudeau entitled “Canadian Liberty.” It depicts the Canadian Human Rights Museum in Winnipeg, and is tied to a fundraising campaign. If donations for March reached $350,000, everyone would get a copy of the sketch. Just like on Oprah: “You would get a copy, and you would get a copy and you would get a copy…”Of course there was no political calculation at all in Mr. Trudeau’s choice of subject. Let’s see, what will I draw? The dog? My kids? The back yard? Oh, I know … how about a representation of Canadians’ devotion to human dignity and basic rights, that echoes my father’s lifelong quest to enshrine those rights in a Charter? Yeah, that’s the idea. Then I’ll watch golf on TV.The sketch is, ah … how shall we put this? Definitely the work of an amateur. There’s nothing wrong with that – no one claims Mr. Harper sounds like John Lennon either. Maybe Ringo Starr. Or Yoko Ono.Art by politicians seems to be something of a trend. Decades ago, Sir Winston Churchill enjoyed painting as a distraction from the pressures of politics and war. His case was a bit unique, in that he had actual talent. More recently George W. Bush, after he left the White House, took to painting amateur portraits of leaders he’d known. Very amateur. Very extremely amateur, in fact. Much as you might describe his presidency.On a sliding scale, where Mr. Bush is a one and Mr. Churchill is a ten, Mr. Trudeau would probably come in at about a three. You can see the resemblance between Mr. Trudeau’s portrait and the actual human rights museum. With Mr. Bush that’s not always the case. His portrait of Mr. Harper, for instance, gives the impression the prime minister may have had the mumps. There is a basic Rotarian feel that you don’t get from the real Mr. Harper. And Mr. Bush’s Vladimir Putin could subtitled: “Zombie Russian President on a bad day.”Mr. Harper followed up his first foray into rock music with several subsequent gigs. He even has a band, the Van Cats (as in 24, in French). Perhaps that means we should also expect more from Mr. Trudeau in the way of artistic endeavor. Perhaps a portrait in oils of the nine Liberal prime ministers, with a 10th sketched in, the face left a blank except for curly dark hair. Or would that be too obvious?

The Hurricanes will remain unbeaten for a week or two yet. In a classic match of two halves at Westpac Stadium on Friday night, the Hurricanes beat the Stormers 25-20 having led 25-3 at halftme. The second spell performance was a tad disappointing from the home side, but they're still seven-from-seven this season, heading into their second bye week.The next team with a chance to lower the Hurricanes' colours will be the Waratahs on April 18. In terms of this Stormers match, there was a bit to get enthused about, almost from the get-go. The Hurricanes were set on shifting the ball whenever possible and seemed likely to score each time fullback Nehe Milner-Skudder got himself in the game. Right wing Cory Jane was similarly elusive and constructive, as the Hurricanes built a very handy halftime advantage.They played some highly attractive footy at times and, had their execution been better, might've managed 40 points for the half.Milner-Skudder, wing Julian Savea and first five-eighth Beauden Barrett were the try scorers in the opening spell, with the last of those the equal of any long-distance team try the Hurricanes have ever scored.A cheer had initially gone up to recognise a turnover won by the home side a handful of metres out from their own line. The ball was immediately shifted right to where Jane opted to have a dab. He fed the ball inside to Brad Shields - who'd earlier shifted from blindside to No 8 to cover for the injured Victor Vito - and he chugged into open pasture.Ma'a Nonu loomed alongside and the healthy crowd of immediately had hopes that the man playing his 150th Super Rugby match might emulate some of his deeds from the pre-match highlights reel that'd played over the big screen. Nonu doesn't quite have the legs he did back in 2003, however, and quickly lobbed the ball back to Shields.The odd forward might've panicked but Shields quickly shifted the ball on to Barrett, who cantered the last 35 metres to score. His conversion came after the halftime hooter and was the perfect exclamation point for such a stunning try.The first half hadn't been all runaway tries and razzle dazzle rugby. Vito stayed down following the lineout which was the springboard for Milner-Skudder's 26th minute try. He limped off with a calf problem, replaced by Adam Hill. Hooker Motu Matu'u was off, then on again, after appearing to get a whack in the face. The bench is a critical part of the modern game and the Hurricanes were being forced to go to their's very early.Mind you, the biggest shame was that the Stormers dominated possession for the 20 minutes immediately after halftime. The crowd had been buzzing after the first 40 but the game went nowhere as the Stormers kept the ball close, bunting it up a metre at a time. It won them a penalty try, when referee Rohan Hoffman ruled the Hurricanes had collapsed a scum, but few admirers in the stands. Hoffman was hardly popular either.Then centre Juan de Jongh twice touched the ball down, for the Stormers. Only the second try was given but Demetri Catrakilis' conversion made it 25-17 with 14 minutes to go.The Stormers' ability to control possession and Hoffman's intervention were important factors in the contrasting halves, but so was Barrett. Good player, lovely skills, just very casual at times too.The Stormers stuck at it and, at 25-20 with five minutes to go, a few of the 13,406-strong crowd were on the edge of their seat. No matter, the Hurricanes got home again.Hurricanes 25 (Nehe Milner-Skudder, Julian Savea, Beauden Barrett tries; Barrett 2 pen, 2 con) Stormers 20 (Penalty try Juan de Jongh tries; Demetri Catrakilis pen, 2 con, Kurt Coleman pen).

Gary Locke has been confirmed as permanent Kilmarnock manager following a spell as interim boss.The 39-year-old has been in charge for seven matches - losing just once - since Allan Johnston's departure.A former Killie player, Locke re-joined the club as Johnston's assistant last summer and was put in interim charge on in early February.The Rugby Park side currently sit eighth in the Scottish Premiership, four points off the top six.New club chairman Jim Mann said recently at the club's annual general meeting that he wanted to have a new permanent manager in place soon.Negotiations had taken place this week and Locke described reports the hold up over his new contract was due to a clause insisting the club finishes in the top six as "nonsense".And the former Hearts manager and captain said it would be a "relief" to get the deal finalised "because I have had a couple of unsettling summers".Locke was released by Hearts last summer as the club came out of administration with a new owner and a new management team."Hopefully I will be looking forward to the summer holidays this year knowing that I am in a really good job and I can start preparing for the new season," added Locke on Thursday."But since I have got the job, I have been preparing the team and looking at the club as if I was going to be here for the next two or three years anyway so hopefully that will be the case."
A man dragged from Wellington Harbour by a group which included two teenage girls, has died in hospital.Hutt Valley Police said Indian international student Boobesh Palani, 26, died on Friday at Wellington Hospital surrounded by friends.Detective Sergeant Grant Carroll said police have spoken to Palani's family who wanted to thank the Wellington community for their support during the last few days."This is a tragedy but thanks to the public's help we were able to establish Mr Palani's identity which meant his friends were at his side for his final few days," Carroll said.Police were continuing to make inquiries into the events leading up to the accident.The attempted rescue happened near Eastbourne when the man's cries were heard from 50m off the coast at 10.30pm on Monday.Payge Olds, 16, and carpenter Jon Derrick leapt in the water and dragged the man back to the beach, where the pair and Olds' 15-year-old cousin Kelly McKay gave him CPR till emergency services arrived.
Her style is followed by women across the globe and whatever she wears is sure to sell out within minutes.Yet the Duchess of Cambridge has been dismissed as an ‘uneventful’ dresser by leading author Margaret Atwood.And most controversially, the 75-year-old said Kate hasn’t lived up to the fashion icon reputation of her husband’s late mother, Princess Diana.Miss Atwood said she thinks the duchess is cautious when it comes to clothes and is told what to wear by advisers.But she added she is right not to follow in Diana’s footsteps.‘I think she dresses quite uneventfully,’ the author of The Handmaid’s Tale said.‘I think she’s watching her back, I think she probably has people who pretty much tell her what is appropriate for her to wear.‘I don’t think she’s become the fashion plate that Diana was, and I think she’s probably doing that advisably,wouldn’t you say?’Miss Atwood is just the latest high-profile female writer to apparently attack the duchess’s image and public persona.Double Booker Prize winner and Wolf Hall author Hilary Mantel has described Kate as a ‘shop window mannequin’ and a ‘machine-made’ princess who has been ‘designed by committee’.Meanwhile Sandi Toksvig has said the duchess doesn’t have a ‘single opinion’ of her own, and Joan Smith caused outrage by labelling Kate ‘unambitious and bland’.Speaking at a talk at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, Miss Atwood, who has also won the Booker for The Blind Assassin, admitted she judges women on the clothing they wear.The novelist, who has been described as a feminist writer, said: ‘Let’s pretend you’re meeting a person for the first time, as you do when you meet a character in a book.‘What do I see? Your dress, I see your face of course, I focus on that. I see your earrings, I see your necklace, and those are all part of you. They are all part of the total image of who I’ve just met.’Miss Atwood’s latest book Stone Mattress prompted her to be labelled ‘offensive’ and a ‘man hater’ by critics last year.Last month a £35 black polka dot dress from online retailer ASOS sold out within half an hour of Kate wearing it to an event.And in 2013 the £46 Seraphine dress she wore for her first official family portrait with William and Prince George sold out two hours after the photo was published.
The family of a 90-year-old woman who had her necklace and bracelet stolen while she was being treated in hospital today branded the thieves as 'despicable'.Florence Kirkham was admitted to County Hospital in Stafford in November last year.While there she celebrated her 90th birthday and her family took pictures of her on the day wearing the gold necklace and bracelet.But after she was discharged on February 10 and went to a care home in Lichfield, the jewellery was found to be no longer in her possession. She has since passed away and her funeral took place yesterday.Her son Glenn Kirkham, who lives in Slitting Mill, Rugeley, has spoken of his anger after the theft.He also said he was disappointed after the hospital wrote to him to say there was nothing they could do.He said: "We know she went in with the necklace and bracelet because she always had them on her wherever she went."When she was released from hospital and to the care home, she didn't have the jewellery on her."We asked the staff there and they said she didn't come in with any jewellery on."I'm incensed someone has done this and taken advantage of my mum. It makes my blood boil."It's not about the money. Who knows, this could have been a patient or a visitor. It just worries me that someone can walk up to an old lady lying in a bed and do this to her. It's despicable."I'm also disappointed the hospital don't seem to want to do anything."Mrs Kirkham was a retired school cook. She left behind one son, Glenn, three grand-daughters and two great grand-daughters.University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust chief executive Mark Hackett said: "We were very sorry to hear that Mrs Kirkham had lost precious items."I have written to the family to explain that the trust cannot accept responsibility for patient valuables unless they have been handed in for ‘safe keeping’ and an official receipt is provided."I understand that this will not bring comfort, however, we are unable to take responsibility for items that we have not been made aware of and agreed to take responsibility for."The trust will be happy to assist the police with any investigations they may wish to undertake."Mr Kirkham informed the police about the disappearance of the jewellery.
Orkney islands Council has approved the loan of items from their museum collection to a university in the Netherlands.An application to loan ‘the lithic assemblage’ from the Neolithic site of Barnhouse to the Faculty of Archaeology at Leiden University was approved by the education, leisure and housing committee.The lithic assemblage comprises 915 flints and pitchstones, with some having been identified as small tools such as arrowheads, piercers, knives and scrapes, to less defined material such as flakes and chips.It was heard at the meeting that all costs associated with the loan, such as transport, courier and insurance, would be met by the borrower.
French police evacuate hostages after launching the assault at a kosher grocery store in Porte de Vincennes. Photo: Thomas Samson/AFPSix people who hid in a supermarket refrigerator during January's Islamist attacks in Paris have sued French media for broadcasting their location live during the siege.Images broadcast from the scene on January 9th, when gunman Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Casher Jewish supermarket, killing four and taking others hostage, "lacked the most basic precautions" and endangered those still alive inside, said a lawyer representing the group, Patrick Klugman.Klugman singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV, which revealed live on air that the group -- including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby -- was hiding from Coulibaly in the cold room, where they were taken by one of the supermarket's employees."The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime," Klugman told AFP Thursday, roundly criticizing coverage by other outlets of security forces movements during the standoff.The lives of those hiding "could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting," Klugman said, adding that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists.The heavily televised events at Hyper Cacher in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. All three gunmen were killed after three days of attacks the killed a total of 17 people and deeply shocked France.The lawsuit charges media outlets with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and 15,000-euro ($16,300) fine.In February France's major TV and radio networks were formally rapped by the French broadcast regulator, the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel (CSA), for what it considered to be serious "breaches" in their coverage of the terror attacks.The warnings were issued for violations including: showing the moment two of the Islamist gunmen cold-bloodedly shot dead a policeman; identifying the two gunmen before police did so publicly; reporting that people were hiding in a Jewish supermarket taken over by a third gunmen; and providing live video feeds of the deadly police assault on the supermarket.The broadcast regulator determined that 36 breaches of broadcast rules had been committed, to different degrees of gravity, by state channels France 24, France 2, France 3, France 5, France Info, France Inter and RFI as well as commercial broadcasters TF1, LCI, Euronews, Canal+, BFMTV, iTele, Europe 1, RMC and RTL.
The Calgary Flames are getting closer to outlining their ambitions for a new arena to replace the aging Saddledome in what’s a hat trick, of sorts.Club CEO Ken King shared the plans with Mayor Naheed Nenshi last month, who then laid them out for councillors earlier this week. It’s an ambitious vision that features three elements in the West Village: a new hockey arena and a football stadium that would also serve as an amateur sports field house. Facilities for track meets, indoor soccer and other amateur sports have long been at the top of community groups’ wish list, so the inclusion of a field house is certain to increase the project’s appeal among Calgarians.“A multi-sport facility is needed in this town, and I think if they can be the ones to bring it to the table and get it done, it looks good on them as well,” said Jason Zaran, incoming chairman of the Calgary Multisport Fieldhouse Society.Zaran’s group has been working with the city’s recreation department on a $202-million proposal for Foothills Athletic Park, just north of McMahon Stadium — a facility that would be financed with tax dollars. Including the field house in the Flames’ proposal could provide the level of public benefit that Nenshi has said is necessary for the city to consider becoming a partner with the Flames ownership. There are other ways the city can help beyond money, of course — by providing some land, for instance.Most Calgarians want to avoid the style of negotiations that Edmonton city council engaged in, taking on ever-larger amounts of debt for the construction of its city’s new $480-million arena. It’s evident, however, that new amenities — ones that provide more suitable homes for the Calgary Flames, Calgary Hitmen and Calgary Stampeders, among other teams owned by the management group — would be an asset to Calgary.Traffic congestion and environmental cleanup would have to be addressed, but the project would mercifully put an end to the performers who give Calgary a miss on their concert tours because of the Saddledome’s distinctive roof, which prevents the staging of elaborate sets.It’s to be hoped the Flames’ new home includes features that make it a must-see meeting place, rather than an unimaginative grouping of sports venues. The ownership group, which includes some of Calgary’s most generous philanthropists, has hinted at a bold vision, so there’s every reason to believe it will live up to expectations when details are formally released. The project would be a tremendous source of pride and economic development for all of southern Alberta.
Chasetown head into this weekend’s fixture back in the groove of things after a handsome win at Sheffield FC last weekend, writes Lewis Cox.The win was an important step for the Scholars as they bounced-back in impressive style following their first set-back under boss Marcus Law.They welcome relegation-threatened Rainworth Miners Welfare to Church Lane tomorrow, before the short trip to Stafford Rangers on Easter Monday.They will be without influential forward Paul Sullivan, the Hednesford Town loanee had 12 goals in 12 games under Law and has now been recalled to his parent club.

Miss Susan McAlpine, the former head teacher of Aberlemno Primary in Angus and Pitcairn Primary near Perth, has died at home after a period of ill health. She was 65.Born in Glasgow, Miss McAlpine spent some time teaching there, including a spell at Castle Toward Residential School.She was appointed as head teacher of Aberlemno Primary early in 1981 and quickly became very active in the local community, taking on roles on the hall committee, Aberlemno WRI, the congregational board of Aberlemno Church and the community council.From Aberlemno she moved to take up the head teacher’s post at Pitcairn Primary in August 1990 where she continued her community involvement.She retired from the role at the end of 2009.Miss McAlpine has been described as an inspirational teacher who will be remembered with great fondness by many.
The 36-year-old beauty was spotted on a Littlewoods shoot on a picturesque beach wearing a pretty summer dress and little else. Playing around in the sand, the star was clearly enjoying her time in the idyllic country with the beautiful surroundings. But, in her surprise at the temperature of the water, Myleene flashed a little more than expected as she lifted the hem of her dress. **CLICK HERE TO SEE MORE PICTURES OF MYLEENE KLASS**The mother-of-two was aghast as she ran through the wash to get back to the warmth of the beachfront. Myleene was shooting her latest advert for the hughstreet brand, wearing a floral dress from her latest collection. The multicoloured flowery frock suited Myleene's impressive figure, and the star danced around the beach holding the edge of her dress. The star posted a picture from her shoot two weeks ago to her Instagram account, saying: "Unbelievable day shooting with the glam squad."It seems Myleene took a couple of days out of shooting to enjoy a holiday with her boyfriend The Great Dane while she was in SA. The loved-up pair were spotted frolicking around in a swimming pool, enjoying some quality time without the presenter's two daughters Hero and Ava. Although they've been dating for around a year, the mystery beau is still only known as The Great Dane.

Boris Johnson was accused of ‘breath-taking cheek’ after he set out his vision of ‘moral purpose’ in business and politics.The London Mayor praised the Coalition for having kept down unemployment and not returning to the dole queues of 1980s Britain.He said the fact that more jobs were being created was ‘one of the absolute moral triumphs’ of the government.The comments by Mr Johnson, who is standing to be a Tory MP in a west London constituency, will be seen as an attempt to position himself as a future party leader.Last night Labour’s Stephen Pound, who is fighting to defend a nearby seat, said: ‘I’m thinking of a sentence with the words pot, kettle and black in it.’‘It seems that Boris’s motto is “do as I say, not as I do”. It really is breath-taking cheek. He obviously has a different definition of “moral” to most of my constituents.’In 2004, Mr Johnson admitted a four-year affair with the journalist Petronella Wyatt while he was married to his second wife Marina, with whom he has four children.Five years later he fathered a child by Helen Macintyre, an unpaid adviser in the London Assembly.Mr Johnson spoke about morality in an interview with the London Evening Standard, saying he believed wealth creation was there to fund public services such as schools and hospitals.He said: ‘I think this country was harrowed by the experience of mass unemployment in the early Eighties.‘One of the absolute moral triumphs of this Coalition government has been to get us through the worst recession for 50 years without seeing a return to those levels of unemployment.’
A MAN who was jailed for a terrifying knife attack on his ex-girlfriend has had an appeal to reduce his life sentence rejected.Kevin Collins, 45, of Boulevard, west Hull, was labelled a "clear danger" by judges at the Criminal Appeal Court.Collins attacked the woman, who he met via a dating website, in Midmere Avenue, Bransholme, after she dumped him in June last year.He repeatedly thrust a 12-inch knife at her, telling the horrified mum that he was going to "stick" her.Collins was eventually wrestled to the ground and disarmed by a police officer in Perran Close.He admitted attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm, making a threat to kill and possessing an offensive weapon.He was jailed for life at Hull Crown Court in September last year and ordered to serve a minimum of six years.Passing sentence, Judge Simon Jack described Collins as one of the most dangerous people he had ever dealt with.Collins' lawyers tried to overturn the life sentence, but the case was thrown out by Lady Justice Sharp, Mr Justice Simon and Mr Justice Holgate.Mr Justice Simon said Collins' history of offending against ex-girlfriends and their partners made him a "clear danger".The judge said: "This was a serious offence in which he had armed himself with a large knife and lain in wait for his victim."The attack was ferocious and sustained and only the quick wit and agility of the victim saved her from serious harm."His previous convictions show that, at the end of each of his last three relationships, he posed a serious danger to his previous partners or their new partners."In our view, the life sentence cannot be considered either wrong in principle or manifestly excessive."In 1997, Collins was jailed for three years for stabbing an ex-girlfriend's new partner after breaking into their home and lying in wait.Ten years later, he was jailed again for setting fire to the home of another former partner.In 2011, he was sent down again for harassing a former partner following the breakdown of their relationship.
Borno Elders Forum, BEF, has called on President-elect, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, to make eradicating all sources of insurgency and insecurity in the country a top priority immediately after assuming office.Chairman of the forum, Alhaji Gaji Galtumari, gave the advice in a statement issued yesterday in Maiduguri, where the forum congratulated the President-elect and Vice-President-elect over their cherished and well deserved victory in the just concluded presidential election.“We see this as a victory for democracy, peace and harmony throughout the country and beyond. It is a victory for the black race and the masses in general,” BEF said.Borno elders, who noted that the congratulatory message needed to be accompanied by few words of advice to the incoming President, said, “Over the past few years, Nigerians have been terribly afflicted by insurgency and high level terrorism.“For us in Borno and indeed the North East, it is not an exaggeration to say that we have been taken back several years in terms of all indices of human development. Although, we believe it was our destiny.“We therefore urge Mr President to promptly eradicate all forms of insurgency and violence across the country.“This should be the starting point. Nothing works without peace. We recently had cause to plead with the nation to come up with a Marshall Plan for the North East, starting first by setting up a high level Presidential Assessment Committee to take stock of the level of devastation.“We need to be quickly rescued, rehabilitated, reconstructed, resettled and re-established.”The statement continued, “Over the few years under reference, Nigeria has been terribly polarised on sectional, religious and tribal lines.“We thank the Almighty Allah that Nigerians remained resolute in their desire for one indivisible, indissoluble and indestructible nation.“Indeed, the spirit of Nigeria as brothers’ keepers persisted at the level of the masses of our people.“Now, Mr President-elect needs to cash in on this spirit of Nigerianness demonstrated by the masses throughout the nation.“It had come to Nigerians constantly relocating to their states of origins each time there are issues like elections, census, and so on.“Nigerians lived in the fear of the unknown even when they desired to live together in peace and harmony.”The statement called on Buhari to quickly address the diversification of sources of revenue generation in the country.It added that the country needed to pay attention to agriculture and solid minerals development.“We equally need to accelerate the exploration and exploitation of petroleum deposits, particularly in the Chad Basin and the Benue Trough and other places.’’It also called for taking away from the streets the millions of unemployed youths.“Jobs need to be created on daily basis and young people should be encouraged to take them up.“All school age children must be compelled to go to school. Massive investment in education and vocational training is a priority.’’It added that Buhari needs a `great’ cabinet to achieve most of the promises made to Nigerians.“We know Buhari to be a straight-forward, simple, honest, incorruptible and just leader.“He has been our Governor in the then North East and also been a Head of State.“From his antecedents, we have no doubt about his ability and resolve to deliver effectively.“Yet, he needs a cabinet of like minds, men and women who would think, dream, work and display transparency like Buhari,” the statement concluded.
CATTLE Country Adventure Park in Berkeley will unveil its new £70,000 animal experience centre for visitors to enjoy over the Easter holidays.As part of its continued investment into the tourism industry, Cattle Country has spent the quieter winter months creating a 3,000 sq ft animal barn.The centre boasts a range of animal pens where visitors can bottle feed animals and witness educational animal talks and demonstrations by its animal carers.In addition the park has welcomed new baby lambs, Tamworth pigs, Welsh Badger-faced sheep, Belted Galloway and White Park Cattle.Other new attractions include new educational zones featuring bird boxes, interactive learning signs and a solar powered water fountain to teach youngsters about solar power.Cattle Country's General Manager, Stuart Burnell, said: "We wanted to further build upon our success of 2014, where we welcomed record numbers of visitors to Cattle Country."We hope this new major attraction and our range of new animals will ensure we maintain our position as one of the best family days out in the region."This facility will improve our visitor experience greatly and we cannot wait to welcome our first guests to the barn over the Easter Holidays."Easter activities will include lamb bottle feeding, falconry displays, an Easter Egg trail, face painting, plus a Frozen themed weekend from Good Friday, April 3 - Monday April 6.
Israel warned on Friday that a framework deal with the West over Iran's controversial nuclear programme was "very dangerous," accusing Tehran of seeking an atomic weapon."This framework (agreement) is a step in a very, very dangerous direction," government spokesman Mark Regev told journalists, adding that Iran's "single goal" behind the accord was to build a nuclear bomb.Iran and Western powers struck an outline agreement in Switzerland Thursday paving the way for Tehran to curtail its nuclear activity in exchange for relief from punishing economic sanctions.
ACT Brumbies rookie James Dargaville can't shake the tag of being Pat McCabe's clone.His teammates yell "pass it Patty" when he touches the ball at training, they even quip that the pair from Sydney's northern beaches dress the same.But retired Australian Wallabies winger McCabe says Dargaville has "a few more strings to the bow" and is set to forge his own Super Rugby identity.Dargaville makes his starting debut against South Africa's Free State Cheetahs at Canberra Stadium on Saturday."I guess there are some similarities between us," says McCabe, who retired prematurely because of chronic neck injuries. "I think he offers more than just being a hard worker, to pigeon-hole him as a grafter isn't doing him justice"He's come in like I did from club footy in Sydney with not a lot of expectation around him and he's taken it with both hands."I think he'll probably develop a few more strings to the bow than I had, that might give him a bit more career longevity than I had."He's been awesome so far, I don't think he's like me. He's making his own way and has his own style, he's going to be a great player for the Brumbies."Dargaville, 22, grew up surfing and sailing in Sydney and can't escape comparisons to McCabe.Both played for Warringah. Dargaville is studying engineering, McCabe is completing a commerce-law degree.Like McCabe, Dargaville prides himself on his backline versatility and putting his body on the line."I guess there are a few similarities on paper," Dargaville said."I feel I can get the best involvements by running hard and tackling hard. That's the best way I can bring myself into a game, and if that's similar to Pat McCabe then I guess we are similar in that way."Dargaville was a flanker only a few years ago before switching to the backs at Sydney University. He stood out in the inaugural National Rugby Championships for the Sydney Stars, the Brumbies swooping to give him a chance in Canberra."The goal posts keep moving quickly. If you said when I first came down that I'd be starting in round eight, I would have said that's unlikely," Dargaville said."But I got my debut in round one and a few games ... things have shifted. It's hard to set goals when they change so quickly."Fellow rookie Blake Enever will also get a chance in the starting team against the Cheetahs, stepping into the second row to replace Rory Arnold.Enever cut his teeth in Queensland working with Wallabies locks James Horwill and Rob Simmons before taking a chance in Canberra."I didn't know what to expect coming here, getting a start is a dream come true and I'm looking forward to the chance," Enever said.Saturday: ACT Brumbies v Free State Cheetahs at Canberra Stadium, 7.40pm. TV time: Live on Fox Sports 2. Tickets available from Ticketek.

As a soccer mom, I am one of the four out of five Calgarians who use my car for driving to work every day and running most errands.I know that city hall’s new Step Forward pedestrian strategy would like me to choose walking as a mode of transport, and shift to a “culture of walking,” but it’s not very practical. I’m guessing most readers would share my frustration with city hall’s new pedestrian strategy.As a resident of McKenzie Towne, it is not so easy to put on my walking shoes and head on down the Deerfoot. It is not possible for me to walk to my place of employment downtown. I could walk my son to school, but it would take close to half an hour, and we would have to cross through a busy traffic circle (and that is if the weather is agreeable enough). Both skating and swimming lessons mean another trip down the Deerfoot to Anderson Road — another almost impossible route for walking.I know I’m not alone. Seventy-nine per cent of Calgarians are driving for “all-day, all-purpose trips” (errands as well as commuting), up two per cent from 2005, according to the city’s 2013 Monitoring Report.Given those numbers, I especially find it frustrating that much of city planning seems to focus around an infrastructure and lifestyle that is an exception and not the norm in Calgary. Recall, the city’s cycle track plan was also deemed a priority by city hall, even though only 1.2 per cent of Calgarians cycle to work. The Route Ahead plan was also deemed a major priority for council back in 2012, and yet only 15.9 per cent of Calgarians use transit to get to work.Unfortunately, I think most people in their cars are too busy to advocate for motorists’ rights. When we’re not driving to work or picking the kids up from daycare, we’re hoping to have enough time to stop by the supermarket for dinner or pick up the dry cleaning. It would be nice to see a Motorists’ Plan.As a motorist seeing so many resources placed toward walking and cycling, I have to ask myself: are my tax dollars really being spent in the best way to benefit society in the here and now? The budget for implementing the pedestrian strategy has yet to be determined. But before it is, I think it is important to ask: would you rather see city hall shave 15 to 20 minutes off your commute each day? Wouldn’t it be great to have more time with your kids or to visit your aging parents?Government should be about prioritizing strategies, particularly in tough economic times. Polls show traffic congestion is a top priority, yet city hall doesn’t seem to be putting our resources toward the public’s priorities.To be sure, the pedestrian strategy should be praised for the strong safety recommendations made that include improving traffic signals, signs and warning lights for pedestrians, as well as focusing safety efforts at pedestrian-generating areas, including hospitals and schools. The Safe Routes to Schools program is also an excellent initiative, providing sound safety education to our youth. Safety should be a priority in a culture of vehicles.There is nothing wrong with planning. Planning is an activity that should be encouraged for the success of organizations, businesses and certainly governments. The problem is when the planning is not concurrent with how people live their lives. The pedestrian strategy concerns me as an effort by city hall to tell us how to live, and not accommodate how we choose to live. Many Calgarians would agree, that’s a step in the wrong direction.

Six people who hid in a supermarket refrigerator during January's Islamist attacks in Paris have sued French media for broadcasting their location live during the siege.Images broadcast from the scene on January 9, when gunman Amedy Coulibaly stormed into the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket, killing four and taking others hostage, "lacked the most basic precautions" and endangered those still alive inside, said a lawyer representing the group, Patrick Klugman.Mr Klugman singled out French 24-hour news channel BFMTV, which revealed live on air that the group - including a three-year-old child and a one-month-old baby - was hiding from Coulibaly in the cold room, where they were taken by one of the supermarket's employees."The working methods of media in real time in this type of situation were tantamount to goading someone to commit a crime," Mr Klugman told AFP, roundly criticising coverage by other outlets of security forces movements during the standoff.The lives of those hiding "could have been at risk if Coulibaly had been aware in real time what BFMTV was broadcasting," Mr Klugman said, adding that the jihadist was following the coverage of his raid on different channels and had been in contact with BFMTV journalists.The heavily televised events at Hyper Cacher in eastern Paris came two days after Cherif and Said Kouachi shot 12 people at the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. All three gunmen were killed after three days of attacks the killed a total of 17 people and deeply shocked France.The lawsuit charges media outlets with endangering the lives of others by deliberately ignoring security protocols, which carries a maximum penalty of a year in prison and €15,000 fine.

RORY McILROY believes it’s unthinkable he won’t win the Masters one day.But the world No.1 won’t pile too much pressure on himself to do it next week as he heads to Augusta on the verge of completing a dream career Grand Slam of all four Majors.At 25, McIlroy would become the second youngest player to join the most elite ranks of golf’s Major legends if he can add a Green Jacket to his existing haul of Open, US Open and US PGA titles.Tiger Woods was a year younger when he achieved a career clean sweep to join Jack Nicklaus, Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan and Gary Player as the only men to hold all four Majors.Now McIlroy admits he can’t contemplate never winning the Master on an Augusta National course set up perfectly for his long straight driving and high ball flight.Ironically, it’s the Major title he could easily have won first rather than waiting for it now to complete his collection, having let victory slip through his fingers on a back-nine blow-up in 2011.Rory McIlroy beams with the US PGA trophyBut McIlroy looks back on that day as the making of him as he used the lesson from that painful experience to learn how to become one of the most formidable frontrunners in the game.McIlroy, speaking to BBC Northern Ireland, said: “For me now it’s a career-long goal to win there to achieve something only a handful of players have achieved.“There’s something special I can achieve going into Augusta this year. You are a complete player if you can win every Major because they are on different golf courses, different tests, different conditions.“Not many guys have done it in history so to put my name there would be awesome. It would just be incredible.“You feel the sense of what can be achieved but I can’t think about that too much.“I just have to think about trying to go out there and playing as best as I can and if I can do that hopefully my scores add up to a shot lower than anyone else’s.”McIlroy has just one top-10 finish to his name in six Masters appearances, finishing joint eighth last year despite the embarrassment of being outscored in the third round by his marker – an amateur club member who holds the course record off the members’ tees.But the 25-year-old cannot picture going through his career without slipping on at least one coveted Green Jacket.He added: “During my career, yes it’s unthinkable.“If I don’t win it this year ... either it’s not the right time or it isn’t your time. If I was to look back as a 60-year-old on my career and not have won a Green Jacket I’d be very disappointed.“And not just one. I feel like it’s a course I can do very well at and a golf course I can hopefully win multiple times on.“Getting that first one is extra important and from there we can go on and maybe think about getting some others.”McIlroy held a four-shot lead going into the final round four years ago, only to collapse to a closing 80 and finish 10 shots behind the winner Charl Schwartzel.But he bounced back to win his first Major title by eight shots in the US Open two months later, before adding victories in the 2012 US PGA and both The Open and US PGA last year. He added: “That was the most important day of my career.“If I hadn’t had that whole unravelling and say I just made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch and lost by one I might not have learned as much.“But for it all to come apart how it did I learned an awful lot.“I learned so much about myself and my game and what I needed to do differently the next time I was in that position.“Luckily it didn’t take me long to get into a position like that again where I was leading a Major and we know how that one played out. I was able to get over the line pretty comfortably.”McIlroy’s extraordinary success last year came despite the distractions of calling off his wedding to Caroline Wozniacki and a legal dispute with his former management company that cost him millions of pounds when it was finally settled in February.And he hopes he can again use the golf course as his “sanctuary” from the pressure and hype surrounding the big event in Augusta. McIlroy said: “The golf course was my sanctuary, it was where I could get away from everything and just not have to think about it for the four or five hours I am out there and it helped. It really did.“I was looking forward to getting to the course and playing and practising and it will be the same at Augusta because there will be so much hype and build-up and talk about what could happen.“I know I won’t be able to wait until Thursday morning or afternoon and just get on the course and play. There’s only so much you can talk about it and then you have to go out and play.”Try our quick sports quiz below:
In one of the most extraordinary finishes in rugby league history, a controversial penalty against Canterbury skipper James Graham has cost the Bulldogs victory against South Sydney on Good Friday.A furious Graham was fuming with the match officials after they penalised the Englishman for attacking the legs of Adam Reynolds, who was trying to land a 45 metre field goal in the dying minutes to take the game into golden point.Reynolds suffered a leg injury in the collision, and if it wasn't for the concern shown by Graham for the Rabbitohs No.7, the officials might not have called time out for video referee Bernard Sutton to inspect.The result was a penalty for the Rabbitohs 10 metres out in front of the posts and an 18-17 victory, not before David Klemmer was sent to the sin bin for saying "you're f---ed, you're off your face", as a number of the Canterbury players unloaded verbal tirades on the referees.In an ugly look for the game, the referees were rushed off the field at full-time as Canterbury fans threw bottles in the direction of the officials, one of which was floored trying to avoid a flying bottle.It was brutal and gutsy, but perhaps undeserved was the best adjective to describe South Sydney's come-from-behind victory in the grand final rematch against Canterbury.The kings of clutch looked to have done it again when Trent Hodkinson slotted a field goal with three minutes remaining, only for controversy to overshadow one of the games of the season.Earlier, it was an old-fashioned ambush, and for a change it wasn't the premiers dishing it out.The Bulldogs produced a brutal and relentless onslaught on their arch nemesis, stunning the Rabbitohs with a type of performance that has become synonymous with South Sydney under the Michael Maguire regime.Sam Burgess' final game of rugby league was on the same ground against the same team almost six months ago to the day.But it wasn't until the grand final rematch, five games into the new season, that his value was truly highlighted.When the Canterbury big men were dictating terms and rolling through the middle of the field with ease, the Rabbitohs forwards were looking around for an answer.For several years, that answer was Sam Burgess.But without the Englishman, and with skipper John Sutton on the sidelines through injury, someone had to stand up.The authority and muscle they relied on to end a 15,724-day premiership drought was nowhere to be seen trailing 10-0 after 15 minutes.Then an error and a brain explosion from Canterbury in the space of 30 seconds turned the game, and Issac Luke, on its head.Luke, who missed last year's grand final through suspension, ignited his team into action on the stroke of half time, darting from dummy half to score.But the moments leading up to the Rabbitohs rake planting the ball on the chalk would leave Luke in Disneyland, Josh Morris on report and Adam Reynolds shooting consecutive shots at goal.The video referee deemed Josh Morris had lashed out with the boot, making contact with Luke's head - not that his skipper agreed."Can you look at the speed we're playing the game at?," an angry James Graham said to referee Gerard Sutton. "How's he supposed to pull out of it?"Prop Sam Kasiano, who made the initial error that gifted Rabbitohs field possession leading up to the try, may also find himself in hot water after leading with his knees and making contact with the head of Luke, who played no further part in the match.The Rabbitohs would also lost Glenn Stewart to concussion mid-way through the second half, but the reshuffle would see a limping Greg Inglis move to five-eighth and Alex Johnston to his preferred fullback position.The positional change seemed to click the Rabbitohs into action, coming from behind to claim victory in front of 40,523 at ANZ Stadium.
Perrie Edwards and Zayn Malik seem determined to show the world they are not to follow the same pattern as One Direction, that is most definitely not heading for splitsville.The pretty 21-year-old posted a loved up snap of the pair posing together arm in arm in the sunshine, with Perrie sticking out her tongue and placing her hand protectively on the former One Directioners’ thigh.Determined to prove their critics wrong that their relationship could be taking a tumble, Perrie tweeted on Friday: ‘LOVE IS IN THE AIR’.The couple are thought to be in Perugia, Italy to escape the UK following the gigantic news that Zayn chose to quit One Direction last week in a bid to have a more ‘normal’ life.Zayn’s mother and two sisters have joined the pretty pair on the trip, which has sparked rumours that their engagement might soon evolve into a Zerrie wedding.Perrie looked the picture of happiness on their sunshine break, posting snaps of the pair kissing, silencing the rumours that they are hitting a rocky patch.Since officially leaving the band last Wednesday Zayn has come under fire from fans after allegedly ‘cheating’ on Perrie in Thailand with a fan, as well as being very quick to get into the recording studio with producer and singer Naughty Boy.Although the Little Mixer seemed not to be letting any of the negative press get to her, as she focused on the warm weather and spending time with her beau, tweeting defiantly on Thursday: ‘Sunny weather should make everyone happy.. right guys’.MORE: Zayn Malik loses 50,000 Twitter follows in wake of One Direction departure – but don’t worry, he’s still popularMORE: Did Louis Tomlinson just deny reports Zayn Malik and Naughty Boy’s song was a One Direction reject?
Melbourne Victory facing off against Melbourne City in an A-League grand final blockbuster. Imagine the interest. You wouldn't be able to get a ticket for love or money as two teams from the same city meet for the first time in an A-League championship decider.Well, you might actually, as, in a worst-case scenario, the game might have to be played at Sydney's Olympic Stadium at Homebush or Allianz Stadium at Moore Park, or maybe at the Adelaide Oval or even Suncorp Stadium in BrisbaneWhy, you might ask, would this happen? Surely there are wonderful stadiums in Melbourne, the self-proclaimed sporting capital of the world, for this showpiece game to take place if a Victorian side qualified to host the title decider.Of course there are. But, thanks to the decision by the AFL to fixture one of its lower-profile home-and-away games at Etihad Stadium on Sunday, May 17, the date of the A-League grand final, no venue is available.With all due respect to the Western Bulldogs (a footy team I have supported for the past 18 years) and Fremantle, the Dogs v Dockers clash is one of the more nondescript on the calendar. The Dogs do not have the largest following in Victoria, while Freo does not exactly pull a vast number of travelling fans either.So why not shift the game that day to Geelong's Simonds Stadium — which, it is understood, is willing to host the match — and allow 55,000-odd Victorian soccer fans to cram into Etihad and savour a grand final that, if it came to pass, would surely be one of the more memorable in the competition's 10-year history?Talks are taking place for such a contingency, but, six weeks out from the conclusion of the 2014-15 A-League season no agreement has been reached. Discussions over financial compensation for the AFL are still a sticking point, it is believed.The FFA's concerns over an appropriate venue to host an A-League championship decider in Melbourne are very real although the possibility remains, as yet, hypothetical.While the chances of Victory facing City in a title decider are slim — Victory are the $3.50 favourites for the championship with Sportsbet, City are priced at $11 to win it — they are not impossible either.Victory play Wellington in New Zealand on Sunday. A win there would put them top of the table and make them an even shorter favourite to take the Premiership Plate and put them in pole position to host the grand final irrespective of what City do.Given that if they make it into the finals they are likely to finish sixth (or perhaps fifth if Perth Glory end up with a significant points deduction if they are convicted of salary cap breaches) City could not host the play-off however well they fared in the finals race.Why, you might ask, would the FFA not play the grand final at AAMI Park if Victory eventually qualify to host it by topping the table and winning their semi-final?It's a purpose-built rectangular stadium, designed specifically for soccer and the rugby codes. It is Victory's home and consistently generates a tremendous atmosphere.All good points and from a sporting point of view — giving the right team the chance to host the grand final — there is a strong case for AAMI.But for the FFA the grand final is a showpiece game. Historically it has always pulled big crowds, selling out the 52,500 Suncorp when Brisbane Roar have hosted several recent championship deciders.It is the code's marquee occasion, and for the FFA a major revenue source. It is on the way to becoming one of the big days on the sporting landscape - and will generate even more traction when the game's governing body fix it for the same date every year, as it plans to. The reality is that AAMI Park's capacity of about 30,000 is simply not sufficient for a match of the grand final's magnitude.What's all that to do with the AFL you night ask? Certainly dyed-in-the-wool footy fans and the game's administrators who see the rise of soccer as a major threat will not feel as if they owe a rival code any favours.They will argue that they are entitled to use Etihad Stadium as they please. They are its major tenants and should be entitled to run their competition as they see fit.All true, all valid. But at what cost? It won't matter to the traditionalists and one-eyed in the footy community, but if Victory qualify to host a grand final in their home city and are forced to move it interstate then there will be a significant PR and reputational impact on the AFL.A large number of Victory's 27,000-odd members are also footy fans and members at an AFL club, not to mention the casual supporters who buy tickets on the day and also go along to the AFL in winter.How many of them are likely to continue their footy affiliation if they are forced to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars travelling interstate to watch a grand final they should be seeing in their home town?Imagine if Victory qualified to host the match against Sydney, Wellington or Adelaide and the game had to be shifted to Homebush, Westpac Stadium or the Adelaide Oval, a move that gave the opposition a huge advantage and ultimately proved crucial in determining the result.All hypothetical at this stage, of course. But it could become a reality. If it does there will be plenty of explaining to do.
Floyd Mayweather's blockbuster May 2 bout with Manny Pacquiao will help make the American fighter's 2015 earnings shatter the all-time record for a sportsman's annual pay, Forbes.com calculated on Thursday.Forbes noted that Mayweather will likely to earn at least $150 million and Pacquiao more than $100 million for the welterweight world title showdown in Las Vegas.The financial news website said payouts could be higher still if more than three million pay-per-views are sold.Mayweather's haul would represent the highest yearly earnings ever by an athlete, surpassing Tiger Woods' inflation-adjusted record of $125 million in 2008, Forbes said.Woods currently occupies both first and second place on Forbes' list of all-time highest paid athletes in a given year, adjusted for inflation, his adjusted earnings of $120 million in 2009 number two on the list.NBA legend Michael Jordan is next, with inflation-adjusted earnings of $115 million in both 1997 and 1998. Woods' $113 million in 2007 and 2010 are next.The highest boxer on the list is former heavyweight world champion Mike Tyson, with inflation adjusted earnings of $112 million in 1996.Forbes said its figures were the result of 25 years of tracking athletes' earnings.Pacquiao promoter Bob Arum has predicted that record-shattering revenue totals for the May 2 mega-fight could surpass $400 million.That includes $74 million from just over 15,000 tickets at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.The foreign rights to the fight sold for a record $35 million, according to Arum.The record for pay-per-view receipts is the $152 million set by Mayweather's 2013 bout with Saul 'Canelo" Alvarez.Mayweather-Pacquiao, a fight more than five years in the making between the men considered the best pound-for-pound fighters of their generation, is expected to "crush" both pay-per-view numbers, Forbes noted.The Wall Street Journal reported this week that the pay-per-view price for the fight will be a record $99 for the high definition feed, with a standard definition version costing a slightly cheaper $89.
This week local Minister, Charlie Flanagan TD, launched the Asia Trade Forum programme for 2015. The launch took place at ESB International in Dublin.During the event Minister Flanagan was shown a presentation on the wide range of international markets that ESB provides services in overseas, especially in Africa and Asia. In his remarks Minister FLanagan referred to the close relationship between Laois-Offaly and the ESB.He told the audience of over 70 business leaders that Laois-Offaly had proven an excellent location for the ESB providing a loyal and skilful workforce.Referring to his Departments’s work in nine Asia countries, he pointed to the opportunities for businesses and farmers that expanding Asian markets are providing, particularly China which recently opened its market to Irish beef and which is a huge consumer of Irish dairy products. Irish trade with Asia-Pacific was worth €6 billion last year.

Loss: The seven-year-old died after she was thrown from her horse. File pictureA seven-year-old British girl died after being thrown from her horse on a riding trip on holiday in India as her horrified father looked on.India Mayhew was out riding in Matheran, 20 miles east of Mumbai, with her father Gavin, her mother, brother, and two sisters when tragedy struck.According to a witness, she was just metres ahead of her father and a riding instructor when the accident happened.She was rushed to hospital and declared dead on arrival.Rajwardhan Khebude, police sub-inspector at Matheran police station, told the Times of India: "'In his statement, Gavin said he was just behind his daughter and saw the entire incident."He said the horse suddenly went out of control and dragged her up to some distance, because of which she suffered serious injuries and died.Trip: The family were out riding at a facility near Mumbai, India. File picture"We spoke to the Mayhews at length and asked them if they feel there was any negligence by the horse rider leading to their daughter’s death."The family had no such complaint and they did not want to register any complaint."Khebude added that the family has already left for their hometown in Sussex with their daughter’s body.The forensic expert who conducted her post-mortem on Wednesday, the day after the accident, said: "She died due to a head injury. During the post-mortem, we also found other physical injuries on several parts of her body."A spokesperson for the British Deputy High Commission in Mumbai confirmed India's death, adding: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'
"You know what they say," Tony Soprano once told his therapist. "Revenge is like serving cold cuts."Any link between rugby league and the mob boss of the hit American television drama The Sopranos is tenuous at best.Yet the angry way South Sydney and the Bulldogs ripped into each other in the Good Friday drizzle at ANZ Stadium left you thinking they'd taken a contract out on each other.With two minutes to go, the Bulldogs appeared certain to be serving up the cold cuts to the Rabbitohs. It would have been mild revenge for last year's grand final defeat at the calculated hands of the same team.Like any good mafiaoso plotline, the full story wasn't revealed until the very end, from a 45-metre penalty goal from Adam Reynolds to get the premiers back into the match, to Trent Hodkinson's clutch field goal to regain the lead, to referee Gerrard Sutton awarding the penalty in front of the sticks with a minute to go after Bulldogs captain James Graham had attacked Reynolds' legs while attemping a field goal.As Sutton left the field, Bulldogs fans pelted him and other match officials with bottles of Coke and water. One was taken to hospital. Brawls sparked outside the ground. It was like we were back in the 1980s. It's not good enough.Afterwards, head of football Todd Greenberg hinted strongly enough that referees deserve respect, and that the lack of respect shown towards them from the Bulldogs, his former club, was to in no small part to blame for the behaviour of the club's fans.Greenberg is essentially on a collision coach with Des Hasler, who he lured to Manly two years ago. Easter will now be a rugby league melodrama.Should it have been a penalty?Kickers in general play need to be protected from rugby league hitmen. Reynolds will miss the rest of the season, or at least four months of it, because of injury.Graham didn't have that in mind when he was trying to smother his field goal attempt. It was purely accidental. What was Graham's alternative? To stand back as Reynolds locked up the scores?This match should not have swung on a refereeing decision. Unfortunately, the game of the season has. Let the executions begin.Until then, the most gruesome whacking happened just before half-time, when Bulldogs forward Sam Kasiano and centre Josh Morris kicked out at Souths hooker Issac Luke. Souths were awarded an eight-point try, Luke didn't return in the second half, and in the end the Bulldogs appeared certain to roll the premiers for the second time in as many weeks.The Rabbitohs celebrated their premiership as hard as any previous winner. One player went so hard he failed to make it onto the open top bus that snaked its way through the streets of Sydney in celebration two days after the win. He was later found asleep in the dressing room at Redfern Oval. But their resolve in the early parts of their premiership defence has impressed. Without Luke and then Glenn Stewart for most of the second half, they refused to yield.Revenge is also something they are thinking up north, as Origin nears and Queensland begin to plot. Despite holding the shield, the make-up of the Blues back line remains typically uncertain.NSW coach Laurie Daley has boldly showed his selection hand already. He's narrowed his fullbacks down to Brett Stewart, Josh Dugan and Matt Moylan.No Brett Morris? Late in the first half, he revealed his value when Alex Johnston chipped over his head but Morris had enough pace and experience to snuff out any chance of a try. Of greater interest – as always – is who will play in the halves. Daley has declared he prefers club combos. Mitchell Pearce at the Roosters is firing ... but Daley could be wary of teammate James Maloney's defence.Adam Reynolds is now out of the running. You may as well run a line through Luke Keary, too, despite his gallant second-half effort.Daley has already declared incumbents Josh Reynolds and Hodkinson deserve first crack for the series opener at ANZ Stadium on May 27. Neither of them produced dazzling attack in Origin last year, but they are built for it because of their toughness.Reynolds has come back from a broken arm after three weeks. He reverted immediately to type when he came on with 10 minutes to go in the first half: he made a break downfield, ducking and weaving under outstretched arms, and then got in a fight with Glenn Stewart.Hodkinson has less shine than Reynolds, but is equally effective. His positioning for the field goal was all class.It should've won his side the game. Instead, they'll have to serve their cold cuts later in the season.
For the third consecutive year, Francis did not hold the traditional service in a basilica, going instead to people on the margins of society and including women.His predecessors had only included men in the service, which commemorates Jesus' gesture of humility towards his apostles on the night before he died.Before Francis, it had always been held in either the Vatican or the Basilica of St. John Lateran. But Francis, continuing a tradition he started when he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, holds it in poorer Rome neighbourhoods with ordinary people.He knelt before the six male and six female inmates, poured water over each prisoner's right foot, dried it with a cloth and kissed it. One of the inmates, an African woman with tears in her eyes, held her child on her lap and the pope washed the child's foot.Francis' decision to include women and sometimes non-Christians - a Muslim woman was in the group two years ago at a juvenile prison - has upset conservative Catholics.In his homily in the chapel of Rebibbia prison on Rome's bleak outskirts, the pope told the inmates that since slaves washed the feet of their masters in Biblical times, the event symbolised service to others and spiritual cleansing.He told them that he too needed personal cleansing and wanted "to become more of a slave in the service of people".One of the altar servers at the Mass was a man convicted of multiple homicides, according to the official television of Italy's Catholic bishops, SAT 2000.The 12 inmates selected to represent the 2,100 prisoners were from Italy, Nigeria, Congo, Ecuador and Brazil.The four-day period that started on Thursday is the busiest in the liturgical calendar for the leader of the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics.On Thursday morning, he celebrated a Mass in St. Peter's Basilica to bless oils used in Church sacraments.He presides at two Good Friday services, including a Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession around the Colosseum.After celebrating Easter Eve and Easter Day Masses, he delivers his twice-yearly "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message on Sunday.
Manchester City midfielder, Frank Lampard, has said he would like to see a gay player come out soon and be treated with respect.The former England international, was speaking on Channel 4’s Chatty Man, when the host – Alan Carr, who is openly gay – insisted that some footballers in England were homosexual.“We have had a couple come out afterwards,” Lampard admitted. “I think it is a fact they will be out there, they are in all lives and times, but we are at fault as a sport. It is that old syndrome where it is a man’s game and you can’t talk about that.“I have to say the game is changing a lot, there are a lot of campaigns and I feel it in the dressing rooms. I would love it if someone came out and everyone treated it with respect.“This silly thing that we are macho and we play football is very old hat.”The 36-year-old also stated that he will always see himself as a “Chelsea boy”, because of the hugely successful time he spent at Stamford Bridge.On Fri, Apr 3, 2015 at 8:22 AM, Ifreke Inyang <ifreke.inyang@dailypost.ng> wrote: Lampard hoping to see a gay footballer come out Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard, has said he would like to see a gay player come out soon and be treated with respect.The former England international, was speaking on Channel 4’s Chatty Man, when the host – Alan Carr, who is openly gay – insisted that some footballers in England were homosexual.“We have had a couple come out afterwards,” Lampard admitted. “I think it is a fact they will be out there, they are in all lives and times, but we are at fault as a sport.

Seven party leaders clashed in the first TV general election debate and snap polls have given a mixed verdict on the winner.If you missed the Conservatives, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP, UKIP, Plaid Cymru and the Greens disagree over immigration, the NHS and spending cuts - here is a 60-second round-up.
LOCALS might call it Hell’s Hole, due to its history and legend, but by the time volunteers have finished tidying it up, it will be more like the vision of Helge’s Hole envisaged by the late Donnie Williamson, complete with benches and signage.A four-stage plan has been created by the Rotary Club of Forres to turn the beauty spot at Cluny Hill into an outdoor classroom type of venue where children can take part in schemes such as the John Muir Award; Brownies and Scouts can learn about the local environment, or locals can enjoy a walk.Volunteers began clearing the area of overgrown shrubs and fallen trees last weekend, and have plans to do even more.Rotarian Sheena MacGillivray explained that they had made a good start, but the long-term plan is to re-establish the beauty spot with seats for walkers to rest and enjoy the view.“Thanks to everyone who helped, we were able to clear the paths to make through access easier,” she said. “We now plan to work on the area regularly.”She said that volunteers are welcome to go along on the first Saturday of every month to press ahead with phase one of what will be a four-year project.The next work party will be on Saturday, April 4 from 9-11am, when local tree specialist Stan Thomson will provide advice on what needs to be done with fallen trees.“If you have a spare couple of hours that day, please come along,” added Sheena.Phase one involves clearing paths, removing fallen branches and trees and repainting or renewing signage. Rotarians hope that by the autumn, phase two should be complete – involving the removal of bracken and deadwood, and thinning. The creation of a picnic area is scheduled for next year, with benches and bins.The long-term plan between now and 2017-18 is to install new signage and interpretation boards about what trees and plants are to be found in the area and encourage more local groups to use it.
The maximum for a speech is going down from five minutes to three, sparking claims that the ruling Labour group is ‘butchering’ democracy.It’s one of several changes voted through at a full council meeting after a task group reviewed the authority’s standing orders.Another change means deputations will no longer be allowed to address council meetings, apart from the planning committee. And councillors are being restricted to two written questions at the full council meeting.Mossend and Holytown councillor David Baird, a member of the SNP group said: “These proposals are designed to hand more power to the Labour group. They make it harder for opposition councillors to hold the ruling group to account”Councillor Tom Johnston, deputy SNP group leader, added: “Labour have gradually butchered democracy in the council as they saw the SNP group growing steadily in size at each election.“The full council now meets only four times a year, plus a budget meeting. In effect, it meets for about 16 hours maximum each year. It’s ridiculous to call this local democracy.”However, Councillor Tom Curley, who chaired the task group, defended the changes.He said: “Very few councillors go over three minutes anyway. If you can’t make a point in that time you shouldn’t be making it at all. As for deputations, having people come to speak at council meetings isn’t the right way to do it.“During the furore over the proposed Our Lady’s-Taylor schools merger, people protested to their councillors at surgeries and their views were taken on board. That’s what councillors are there for.”
Jacqueline Johnston (52) appeared at Falkirk Sheriff Court last Thursday after being found guilty on indictment for being concerned in the supply of class B amphetamine and a class C substance.It followed a swoop on her Bo’ness home on December 6, 2012, when £3600 worth of drugs were recovered.Johnston had previously held a senior position with Signpost Recovery, a Forth Valley service for those coping with substance abuse.Inspector Christopher Stewart said: “This was a significant recovery in the Central Scotland area and we welcome the sentencing of Jacqueline Johnston.“Tackling serious and organised crime is a top priority for Police Scotland.“We will not tolerate this type of criminality and will continue to pursue those involved with all the resources at our disposal.”Johnston’s conviction followed a three-week trial where she denied the charges against her.She was found guilty of being concerned in the supply of amphetamine on December 6, 2012, and, between May 28 and December 6, 2012, of being concerned in the supply of class C phenazepam at 32 Baptie Place, Bo’ness.Murray Aitken, defending, said: “The impact of this conviction is significant for her. She has had quite a spectacular fall from grace.“She is well known in Bo’ness and her standing in that community has been ruined.”Sheriff Kenneth McGowan said: “You have been convicted on indictment of two serious charges. Only a custodial sentence is appropriate.”As Johnston, 44 Jessfield Place, Bo’ness, was sentenced, there was loud gasps and crying from the public gallery.Johnston’s solicitors this week confirmed she intended to appeal her conviction.
IF you've ever been tempted to poke a three-metre-long adult anaconda with a stick, then after watching the above video, we think it's probably for the best you pack that dream up and file it away under 'not your smartest moment'.Most of you wouldn't even dream of disturbing a wild snake in its habitat, but this man traded in all his common sense for gusto and went ahead with the ridiculous stick-poking.What could go wrong ?Leaning towards the water, the man nervously skims the water with the end of his stick.So far so good..But when there doesn't appear to be much movement in the reeds by the riverbank, the man gets a little more brave.He begins poking the stick deeper into the water - and it doesn't take a genius to realise this is his big mistake.In a split second the huge snake comes leaping from the river bed with its jaws wide open ready to bite.The man leaps backwards yelling: "Oh s***!" as the anaconda springs towards his legs.Thankfully, after steadying himself on the bank, the man appears to be laughing and seems to have got away from the snake unscathed.The heart-stopping clip has been shared online more than 10,600 times.
Former Rangers player Fernando Ricksen at the Sunshack in Hamilton with staff, where he gave a donation to the Do It For Dylan Bittles charity fundA Rangers legend is helping to ‘Do it for Dylan’ after backing a campaign to give a Larkhall lad the chance to take his first steps.Fernando Ricksen has helped smash the £20,000 mark as the family of Dylan Bittles (3) look to take him to the USA for life-changing treatment.Mum Donna Bittles (25) revealed the former Ibrox star donated to Dylan’s cause, after noticing the ‘Do It For Dylan’ charity box at Sunshack in Hamilton.While staff at the tanning salon offered Ricksen free treatments, he declined and gave all the money he would have paid for the tan to Dylan’s charity.Dylan needs £60,000 so he can travel to the USA for life-changing surgery before the end of the year that could lead to him walking.He suffers from quadriplegia cerebral palsy, meaning he is in a wheelchair with limited movement and has very little independence.Before our story last month, around £1000 had been raised for Dylan. Now, readers as well as Dylan’s family and friends have rallied behind the Larkhall youngster.Over £18,000 has been raised through the Just Giving page.However, with some donations going directly into a bank account that is set up for Dylan through charity Tree of Hope, mum Donna expects the total to be well over £20,000 at this stage.Last Sunday also saw a huge total raised following a sponsored walk around Strathclyde Park, collecting £4000 as Dylan led friends and family in a walk over two miles.Donna has thanked the public for their support so far and hoped to keep going full steam ahead with fundraising.She said: “It’s been crazy, the phone has just been going constantly. It’s not just been friends and family but complete strangers getting in touch, trying to find out how they can get involved.“The Fernando Ricksen donation was a strange one but it’s really thanks to the girls at Sunshack for getting Dylan’s box noticed on the first day it was out.“Dylan likes Rangers and Chelsea, so I know he will appreciate that, though unfortunately Fernando Ricksen may be a bit before his time.“The walk around Strathclyde Park will hopefully mark the beginning of even more big things for us.”Dylan is booked in for surgery known as selective dorsal rhizotomy at the St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri.The procedure and the equipment will cost around £30,000, with flights and accommodation set to cost £10,000 for the six weeks they will spend in Missouri.The rest of the money will be spent on aftercare in Scotland, with private doctors required for Dylan following the surgery.Donations can be made at www.treeofhope.org.uk/get-him-there or www.justgiving.com/dylanbittles, and more information can be found at the ‘Dylan’s Fundraiser’ Facebook page.Read more stories from the Hamilton Advertiser .

Andrew Dunn in a still from the York i-Travel campaign videoA NEW campaign has been launched to promote cycling, car sharing, walking and travelling on public transport in and around York.City of York Council’s i-Travel York video campaign features York actor Andrew Dunn, who is known for his roles in Coronation Street and Victoria Wood’s Dinnerladies, and has been written by BAFTA award-winning scriptwriter Jimmy Richards, who is also from the city.A teaser trailer launches the first in a series of light-hearted videos which will be released throughout the year.The first short video focuses on cycling in and around York and is timed to coincide with the inaugural Tour de Yorkshire, stage two of which will finish in York on May 2.In the teaser trailer, however, the character of Greg, played by Andrew, is seen cycling up a steep cobbled street in Haworth, which is also on the route of the Tour.During the clip, which recreates the famous Hovis advert and features the York Railway Institute Brass Band playing Dvorak’s New World Symphony, viewers see Greg’s bike suddenly get a flat tyre.David Short, i-Travel York programme manager, said: “We know that even more residents than ever are reconsidering their travel options.“In fact, feedback from our recent door-to-door exercise in the north of the city found that 24 per cent of participants overall said they are now using their car less and that the sole reason they reduced their car use and considered modes of transport was because of the i-Travel York programme.“We also know from cycle counters across the city that cycle journeys have increased by 35 per cent between 2008 and 2014.“We’re delighted to have Andrew fronting the campaign and hope this will encourage even more residents to consider sustainable modes of transport.”Mr Dunn, said: “As a York resident, I know it’s not always easy travelling around the city so anything which helps get the message out there that there’s support for people to try cycling or catching the bus more, I’m happy to be a part of. “Like a lot of the characters I play, it’s done in a very lighthearted way and it’s been a great project to be a part of.”To view the trailer go to itravelyork.info

A mole inside the racist group helps several law enforcement agencies bust a conspiracy to kill a black inmate after his release.Three current and former prison guards arrested in Florida on Thursday were also members of the Ku Klux Klan and allegedly used Klan meetings to plan the murder of a black inmate after his release.Thomas Jordan Driver, 25, and David Elliot Moran, 47, were working as corrections officers when they were arrested. The third suspect brought in, Charles Thomas Newcomb, 42, was fired as a prison guard in 2013. All three are members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (TAKKKK), according to court documents.Thursday’s arrest came after an investigation that appears, judging from redacted affidavits signed by FBI agents involved in the case, to have been built on testimony from a mole inside the Florida KKK. The FBI’s informant is never named.A statement from the Florida Attorney General’s office lists multiple law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, including the Florida Highway Patrol and Florida Fish and Wildlife. A spokeswoman for the FBI's Jacksonville Division confirmed that her office initiated and spearheaded the investigation but added, “there were a lot of agencies that participated.”The murder plot came to the attention of law enforcement started at a Klan meeting in late 2014. That’s where Moran and Newcomb introduced Driver to an FBI confidential informant posing as a KKK member, according to court documents. The purpose of that meeting, judging by the conversation that follows in the affidavit, was to arrange a killing.“The defendants plotted the murder as retaliation for a fight between the inmate, who is African American, and Driver,” according to a press release from the state’s Attorney General’s office. Conversations between the men involved and the FBI informant shed more light on the motivations involved. Driver appeared to be carrying a vendetta since getting into a fight with the inmate who he said bit him during the altercation with the intent of giving him a fatal disease.According to the FBI’s account of that initial meeting, Driver and Moran both “told the [informant] that they wanted [redacted] to end up “six feet under.” Another man present at that initial meeting was TAKKKK Grand Dragon Jamie Vincent Ward. After hearing the plans Ward tells the informant, “they would have a sit down to discuss the [redacted] situation.” No charges have been filed against Ward.The plot progresses in subsequent conversations recorded by the FBI to discussions of what kind of weapon to use, and where and when to do the killing. Driver vents more about over his anger over the initial fight and the need to get revenge as he and his partners lace their plans with Klan salutations and racial epithets.No killing ever takes place, but the FBI stages a murder scene after informing the target of the conspiracy against him.  “Immediately upon notification,” the affidavit notes, the intended victim, “spontaneously stated that it must have been ‘those police’ and that they must not be satisfied yet.” With his cooperation the FBI staged a photo and manipulated it to make it look as if he’d been shot to death. That photo was then taken around by the informant on a burner phone and shown to the guards and ex-guard moonlighting as Klansmen, who gave their approval for a job well done. Then they all got arrested.Newcomb was fired from the corrections department in 2013, less than a year after he was hired as a trainee for, “failure to meet correctional officer’s minimum training requirements,” according to Florida Department of Corrections spokesman McKinley Lewis. He was arrested in February and released on bail after impersonating a police officer while acting as an unlicensed debt collector. Those setbacks didn’t seem to impact his stature in the KKK where, at the time he arranged the meeting between Driver and the informant, he was heading the group as its “Exalted Cyclops.”Driver and Moran, meanwhile, were still working for the prison system when they first met with the informant and allegedly asked him to kill someone. Moran began working in corrections in 1996. Driver was hired in 2010. The two were fired Thursday after being arrested at work.Documents provided by the Florida Department of Corrections show that both men received written reprimands for their job performance. Neither was punished in writing for anything related to racism or prisoner abuse.Calls to the TAKKK were not returned, but an excerpt of the material posted on the group’s website lays out its mission.The “Why Join?” section of the TAKKKK’s website opens with this: “Today, many people have experienced the blacks firsthand. They have seen the savagery and animalism in many of these people”It continues: “Once people understand that the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is simply a movement of White people for the highest standards of Western Christian Civilization, and that the KKK did WIN its first struggle for our people in the post Civil War period, they will naturally turn to us for an answer to today's crisis.”The TAKKKK is headquartered in Missouri, according to Mark Potok, an expert on extremist groups at the Southern Poverty Law Center. Potek dismisses the TAKKKK’s, “absolutely outlandish claims about having thousands of members. That is false, it’s a lie.” White supremacist groups were once deeply ingrained in law enforcement in the deep South, according to Potok, but that’s no longer the case. The truth, Potok said, is the KKK’s membership has declined in recent years. “Add all the Klan groups together and there are fewer than 4,000 across the country.”Despite the national decline, Florida still ranks second in the country behind California for number of hate groups. Of the 50 hate groups that the SLPC monitors in Florida, the majority are white supremacists.An FBI investigation in July 2014 linked officers in the Fruitland Park police department to the KKK. The ex-wife of an officer fired in the aftermath of the allegation claimed that they had been assigned by the department to work undercover investigating the KKK. Those claims were never substantiated and the allegations, which came after an officer from the same department was fired in 2009 for KKK affiliation, led the chief of police to resign despite denying any connection to the hate group.
Allah’s blessings be upon you, Mike Pence. Now that “religious conscience” means whatever, we Muslims are going to town!I, along with millions of Muslims across the country, have to give it up for Indiana Governor Mike Pence and his merry band of liberty-loving Republicans in the state legislature.  The “religious liberty” law they recently enacted may be causing an uproar, but for us Muslims, it means we can now finally impose sharia law in Indiana!I’m not sure who is happier, the Wiccans or us?  As The Daily Beast’s David Friedlander wrote on Tuesday, the Wiccans are loving this law. Okay, actually they think it’s a “horrible” law because of its potentially discriminatory impact against the LGBT community. But as Dusty Dionne, High Priest and High Summoner of the Aquarian Tabernacle Church of Washington State, told Friedlander, “If they are going to open up this can of worms, we are going to shove it right in their face.” There has to be one Muslim Wiccan out there who is truly delirious with joy. (Although I’m not sure technically if such a combo is possible.)In any event, while the NCAA, Apple, and others may be thinking of steering clear of the Hoosier state, we Muslims are coming.  Think a caravan of wagon trains heading to the Midwest in the 1800’s, but this caravan will be all Muslim, and we will be coming to the state in everything from Mercedes Benzes to taxi cabs.Some might be asking, could Muslims really impose sharia law in some fashion in Indiana—turning Indiana into a mini Muslim caliphate?  Well, the Indiana law doesn’t just provide “religious liberty” for Christians. It provides “liberty” for all faiths, and that includes us Muslims. (Yes, that shrieking sound you heard was from the Christian conservatives who championed this law intending it to truly only benefit fellow Christians.)So what does the law provide? Simply that the government can’t “substantially burden” our religious practices unless it can prove that it  “(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.”Bottom line: There are now so many things we can now do in Indiana that we are not able to do in the rest of America. For starters, it’s time for me to go wife shopping. You see, I can have up to four wives in my faith. I truly can’t think of any “compelling governmental interest” that could prevent that.I can’t wait to see the face of the conservatives who refused to bake a cake for a gay couple when I say I want a cake for my heterosexual marriage and they smile. And then I add, it’s so I can take a third wife.  Wonder how they will react?Maybe we can get deals on wedding dresses if we buy three or four at a time?  Sorta like the great deals at Costco when you buy in bulk.  And the upside for Pence and his right-wing comrades is the expected wedding industry boom in Indiana from all these Muslims weddings. It could possibly even make up the revenue Indiana will lose if in the future the NCAA refuses to hold its annual basketball Final Four there or the NFL says no more Super Bowls.And wait until we start blasting our call to prayers (known as the Adhan) five times a day across the Hoosier state. The first one known, as Fajr, is right before sunrise. Nothing says “wake up Indiana!” like a man calling out in Arabic at five in the morning for everyone to come pray.  And to show our appreciation, after each sunrise prayer, we can use the statewide sound system to thank Mike Pence by name.Plus if you come to any of our restaurants you better say, “As-Salaam-Alaikum.” Look, it’s either “submit or no shawarma.” And if you try to sue us because you are upset we are forcing you to say this, well guess what, the Indiana law offers us a defense to that because saying “peace be with you” is part of our religion.This is only the tip of the iceberg of “Muslim stuff” we will be joyfully imposing—I mean, practicing- in Indiana thanks to the GOP. I asked my Muslim friends via social media what else the good people of Indiana can expect to see in the near future. So here you go:- Allow wudhu (the washing before our prayers) in public fountains.  Think the opening of the TV show Friends with the cast frolicking in public fountains, but instead it will happen five times a day and feature a much more racially diverse group of people.- Stop paying interest on credit cards and mortgages. To some Muslims, interest payments (known to as “riba”) are considered a violation of Islam.- All Cracker Barrels must be halal—Hope you like turkey bacon on your BLT.-Being permitted to take naps during the month of Ramadan when Muslims fast.- Bidets in every public bathroom. (This was a popular suggestion.)- Nobody is allowed to walk in his house with shoes on. (Okay, this isn’t based on the religion but culturally is a big one for many Muslims, so why not?)- Randomly show up to pray in offices of Republican representatives.And the list goes on.I’m sure the conservatives who passed Indiana’s SB 101, especially the three despicable anti-gay bigots who stood behind Pence cheering him on when he signed this law, never expected that they would be turning Indiana into a Midwestern mecca for Muslims. But here’s hoping other Republicans state legislatures do the same thing soon. Before you know it we will be hearing the call to prayers across the nation. I especially can’t wait until it comes to Texas!
Nuneaton Town face a daunting Easter task on Saturday when they travel to top-of-the-table Barnet in search of a survival pick-me-up after last weekend’s setback at home to Halifax.But Boro boss Liam Daish is relishing the challenge against Martin Allen’s high-flying Bees, insisting: “I think it’s a good game for us to come back to.“We’ve been on a great run of seven games without a defeat which ended on Saturday but this is a great opportunity – there’s a pressure on Barnet because it’s really tight up there with Grimsby and Bristol Rovers and just one point separating all three.“They have got their own agenda so there will be a bit of pressure on them at home while we go there looking to get back on the horse. We have proved we can go to top six sides and get something. We went to Macclesfield and played very well and deserved our result so we’ll draw confidence from that.”Reflecting on Saturday’s 2-1 home defeat by Halifax, he said: “A lot of things went against us, to be fair. They were very direct and physical and used the wind to their advantage in the first half. They had a long thrown and launched that forward at every opportunity to put us on the back foot and we struggled to deal with that early on and went a goal down.“We needed to get a foothold in the game and couldn’t do that but in the second half we came out and used the wind and made the keeper produce some good saves. I think if we’d got that equalising goal we’d have gone on to win it.”As for new loan signing Jaanai Gordon from West Ham, Daish said of the 19-year-old striker: “He came into the side because I thought Andy Brown needed a breather, especially in the first half against the wind, and we needed that bit of energy running in behind to make that transfer of pressure. It was a difficult game in difficult conditions but he did well and has given us something different up front, and in wide areas as well.“We lost George Maris in the warm-up. He’s been a good player for us since coming from Barnsley so we went from leaving players out the week before at Macclesfield to going into Saturday almost down to the bare bones again, so it was important to bring a forward thinking player in when we did.”Front man Maris had a scan on Tuesday and Daish is awaiting the results of that after the player twisted a knee in the warm-up ahead of the Easter double header which concludes at Liberty Way against mid-table Braintree on Monday.“We’ll see how he is but whatever happens these two games are going to really stretch us in terms of personnel. But we’ll get through Saturday, see where we are and go again against Braintree on Monday.”
CLEVELAND - A two-year-old boy fell into a cheetah pen at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo and hurt his leg after his mother dropped him but the wild predators in the enclosure did not approach him, zoo officials said on Saturday.The child's mother was holding him over an observation wall abutting the enclosure when she dropped him, said Metroparks Zoo spokeswoman Sanaa Julien."The cheetahs made no attempt to interact with the child and parents at any time," Cleveland Metroparks Zoo executive director Christopher Kuhar said in a statement.The child, whose name was not released, was rescued from the enclosure and transported by ambulance to MetroHealth Hospital after sustaining a leg injury from the fall, according to a statement from Cleveland Metroparks Zoo.The exhibit, which houses two male cheetahs, was closed down for the remainder of the day, Julien said.Cleveland Metroparks, the organization that runs the 183-acre zoo and a number of parks in the Cleveland area, plans on Monday to press for misdemeanor child endangering charges against at least one parent of the child, according to its statement.
Two people have been killed in a light plane crash in the NSW northern tablelands.Emergency services were called to a property off Nine Mile Road, north of Glen Innes, about 10.30am on Sunday.Both pilot and passenger were pronounced dead at the scene, police confirmed.
Aaron Ramsey scored the only goal as Arsenal gave Premier League leaders Chelsea food for thought with a scrappy 1-0 win at second-bottom Burnley on Saturday.The Welsh midfielder struck in the 12th minute at Turf Moor, slicing the ball into the roof of the net from close range after teammates Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil had seen efforts repelled.The result lifted Arsene Wenger's side to within four points of Chelsea, who visit struggling west London rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, and kept Sean Dyche's Burnley two points from safety."It was a battling performance more than a fluid performance, and that was because Burnley are perfectly organised and very fit to keep their shape for the full 90 minutes," said Wenger.The Loftus Road trip is the first of two games in hand for Chelsea, but with matches against Manchester United and Arsenal also on the horizon for Jose Mourinho's side, Wenger's men may yet have a word to say in the title race.They failed to convince against Burnley, but have now won eight league games in succession for the first time since the 2003-04 'Invincibles' season and seem assured of a Champions League place at the very least."I don't think that our game against Chelsea will decide the Premier League title," Wenger added."They have two games in hand, but we have to just to keep going. We have promised ourselves to do as well as we can until the end and then we will see where we stand."Earlier, Tim Sherwood returned to haunt former club Tottenham Hotspur as Aston Villa improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 1-0 victory in north London.Christian Benteke decided the game, nodding in an inviting right-wing cross from Leandro Bacuna in the 35th minute to register his eighth goal in six matches.On his return to White Hart Lane following his sacking by Spurs at the end of last season, Sherwood saw his Villa side open up a six-point cushion over the relegation zone.But victory came at a price, with centre-back Ciaran Clark and striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who hit the post, forced off by injury and Carlos Sanchez sent off in stoppage time after receiving two yellow cards."It's a fantastic result," said Sherwood. "We carried on from the good performance in the 3-3 draw against QPR. We thought we could have a good go, and we did. I thought we deserved to win."Spurs' defeat cost ground in the battle for European places, with Southampton moving two points above them -- and leapfrogging Liverpool -- by winning 2-0 at home to Hull City.James Ward-Prowse broke the deadlock with a 56th-minute penalty after former Hull striker Shane Long had been tripped by Alex Bruce. Graziano Pelle then ended a 14-league-game scoring drought with a late strike.Hull remain in trouble, two points above the bottom three in 17th place, and Sunderland are just a point better off following a humbling 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace.Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yannick Bolasie became the first Palace player to score a Premier League hat-trick and also set up a goal for Glenn Murray as Alan Pardew's team claimed a fourth successive win.Connor Wickham scored a late consolation for Sunderland, who were brought down to earth with a bump after beating derby rivals Newcastle United 1-0 on their previous outing.Bottom club Leicester City gave their hopes of avoiding relegation a huge boost by twice coming from behind to win 3-2 at West Bromwich Albion, which lifted Nigel Pearson's side to within three points of safety.David Nugent and Robert Huth successively cancelled out efforts by Darren Fletcher and Craig Gardner before Jamie Vardy charged to the edge of the West Brom box and drilled home an injury-minute winner for the Foxes."It was an exceptional goal (from Vardy), but we can't get carried away," said Leicester manager Pearson."It's great to get back-to-back wins, but we still have an awful lot to do."Jonjo Shelvey's penalty earned Swansea City a 1-1 draw with Everton, while Marko Arnautovic rescued a 1-1 draw for Stoke City at West Ham United, who had gone in front through a fine 25-yard free-kick from Aaron Cresswell.
Could this season be the year of the Hurricanes? Are the rest of the Super Rugby teams going to get blown away by the men from Wellington?The Hurricanes are desperate, playing with confidence, playing with flair, but most of all, when those attributes are combined, they have a game plan that is delivering results.Maybe it has to do with the unspoken word as well. The word that can spook players, coaches and teams.The word that starts with a W, ends with an N and has an I in the middle. Just make sure you don't mention that in the same sentence as Super Rugby because that might just jinx the run.But at some stage you have to. You have to have the confidence and belief in yourself and your teammates to say we can do this. We can WIN.Sometimes it's this fear of failure that clicks in to overdrive and stifles any chance of a team being successful, but so far this season for the Hurricanes, it has been like watching last year's Waratahs. Taking risks and being rewarded.Could we have a new maiden champion this year? Someone to step up to the plate and hit it out of the park?I know I said in my first article this year that the Waratahs could go back to back, but just maybe this outfit might be different to those of the past.In my playing days the toughest - and certainly most unpredictable - team to face were the men from Wellington.Yet there was a similarity at the the time between the two teams. The Waratahs and the Hurricanes always seemed to carry the perennial underachievers tag. Always spoken about with so much potential and talent but never really having the mental strength to go on and forge a championship victory.This season has been very good for them. Excelling as usual physicality-wise has allowed for some magnificent displays in attack.The prodigal son Ma'a Nonu has relished being back and is making a significant difference in the back line, strengthening their midfield.Cory Jane on the wing is a classy finisher and complemented by the immovable force of Julian Savea on the other.Perhaps the unsung heroes have been the forwards. With the likes of Victor Vito, Ben Franks and Jeremy Thrush, it makes for a difficult assignment to push those blokes around.Yet the glue holding all this all together is their five-eighth, Beauden Barrett.Barrett seems to be one of those players who has an incredible ability to find time and space. Everything looks effortless and easy, like he is not trying.Complementing those attributes around the park is his conversions, which most often turn the five-pointers into seven.They have the grace of the week off to recover from a hectic eight weeks and ready themselves to take on the Waratahs next week at home. For the Tahs it will give them a barometer of where they stand in relation to the Kiwi teams.But the strength of Kiwi rugby is not limited to the Hurricanes at the moment.I'm sure teams are keeping an sneaky eye on how the Crusaders are progressing, especially after the demolition of the Sharks in Durban.There was no Dan Carter in that match, and Richie McCaw came off the bench, showing the depth of the seven-time champions. They even kept the same back line for last night's clash with the Highlanders.The boys from Otago find themselves in the mix with some strong performances and have shown good courage in their wins and some close losses that would encourage them to push on for the finals. There's plenty still to play for.The Chiefs too are placed well. The two-time champions have gone about their business with some real statements in their wins.A double over the Blues, who are only playing catch-up now, and a strong win over the Brumbies early sees them still very much in the mix.In fact, at the time of writing, four of the New Zealand teams made up the top six.The only exceptions were the leaders of the other conferences - the Brumbies and the Bulls. It certainly makes for depressing reading for the other franchises striving to make the cut in round 18, but stranger things have happened.Best for those other teams to worry about themselves first and hope that the sides cancel each other out in the land of the long white cloud. But that could be a long shot.
Deputy sheriffs in southern California are under investigation after a TV news helicopter caught them on video kicking and beating a suspect who was fleeing on horseback.Francis Jared Pusok, 30, a white male with a criminal record, was kicked 13 times, punched 37 times and struck four times with batons, according to KNBC television in Los Angeles."I'm disturbed by what I see in the video," San Bernardino County sheriff John McMahon told the station, whose chopper hovered over the scene.He ordered an internal investigation into the incident, which occurred in desert scrub in Apple Valley, 130 kilometres from Los Angeles.It came five days after a white police officer in the South Carolina city of North Charleston was caught on video gunning down a fleeing African American suspect.The officer, Michael Slager, has since been charged with the murder of Walter Scott, 50, and fired from the force, in the latest fatal confrontation in the US between white police officers and unarmed black suspects.Pusok was being served a warrant related to an identity theft investigation when he first fled on foot, then stole a horse, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department said on Friday.From the KNBC video, it appeared Pusok was zapped with a Taser when he fell off the horse, after which up to 11 deputies began striking him.He remained on the ground for 45 minutes, getting no medical attention before he was taken to hospital, the television station reported.The sheriff's department acknowledged that "use of force occurred" after the Taser proved ineffective due to "loose clothing" that Pusok was wearing.Three deputies also got medical treatment - two for dehydration and a third who got kicked by the horse, which itself sustained "numerous injuries".
British comedian Russell Brand has tweeted his support for saving Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from an Indonesian firing squad.Saturday's tweet from Russell Brand (@rustyrockets) reads: These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP! info.mercycampaign.org/watch/.The tweet includes a link to the website of the campaign for mercy for the convicted drug traffickers, where video interviews of the pair can be viewed and a petition signed.Brand is well known for his outspoken views on politics and human rights and in February blasted Australia's policy of using offshore migrant detention centres.Chan and Sukumaran's fight to avoid execution last week moved to Indonesia's constitutional court after they lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court.The pair's lawyers on Thursday sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency.Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the latest challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it.Jakarta is now just waiting on the legal efforts of a few other death row prisoners before setting an execution date.The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island, where Indonesia plans to execute them by firing squad.
Justin Bieber got a little handsy with Ariana Grande during a performance on Wednesday night, much to the dismay of her boyfriend Big Sean, who went on Twitter and threatened him.Bieber made a surprise appearance at Grande’s concert at the Forum in Los Angeles on Wednesday, where the two performed As Long As You Love Me. Toward the end of the song, Justin calls her over, tells her to stand in front of him and throws his arms around her.It’s pretty apparent Ariana’s not having it and she quickly disentangles.But apparently not quick enough for Big Sean, who was in Canada and caught wind of Bieber’s antics through social media.

Aaron Ramsey scored the only goal as Arsenal gave Premier League leaders Chelsea food for thought with a scrappy 1-0 win at second-bottom Burnley on Saturday.The Welsh midfielder struck in the 12th minute at Turf Moor, slicing the ball into the roof of the net from close range after teammates Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil had seen efforts repelled.The result lifted Arsene Wenger's side to within four points of Chelsea, who visit struggling west London rivals Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, and kept Sean Dyche's Burnley two points from safety."It was a battling performance more than a fluid performance, and that was because Burnley are perfectly organised and very fit to keep their shape for the full 90 minutes," said Wenger.The Loftus Road trip is the first of two games in hand for Chelsea, but with matches against Manchester United and Arsenal also on the horizon for Jose Mourinho's side, Wenger's men may yet have a word to say in the title race.They failed to convince against Burnley, but have now won eight league games in succession for the first time since the 2003-04 'Invincibles' season and seem assured of a Champions League place at the very least."I don't think that our game against Chelsea will decide the Premier League title," Wenger added."They have two games in hand, but we have to just to keep going. We have promised ourselves to do as well as we can until the end and then we will see where we stand."Earlier, Tim Sherwood returned to haunt former club Tottenham Hotspur as Aston Villa improved their chances of avoiding relegation with a 1-0 victory in north London.Christian Benteke decided the game, nodding in an inviting right-wing cross from Leandro Bacuna in the 35th minute to register his eighth goal in six matches.On his return to White Hart Lane following his sacking by Spurs at the end of last season, Sherwood saw his Villa side open up a six-point cushion over the relegation zone.But victory came at a price, with centre-back Ciaran Clark and striker Gabriel Agbonlahor, who hit the post, forced off by injury and Carlos Sanchez sent off in stoppage time after receiving two yellow cards."It's a fantastic result," said Sherwood. "We carried on from the good performance in the 3-3 draw against QPR. We thought we could have a good go, and we did. I thought we deserved to win."Spurs' defeat cost ground in the battle for European places, with Southampton moving two points above them -- and leapfrogging Liverpool -- by winning 2-0 at home to Hull City.James Ward-Prowse broke the deadlock with a 56th-minute penalty after former Hull striker Shane Long had been tripped by Alex Bruce. Graziano Pelle then ended a 14-league-game scoring drought with a late strike.Hull remain in trouble, two points above the bottom three in 17th place, and Sunderland are just a point better off following a humbling 4-1 defeat at home to Crystal Palace.Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yannick Bolasie became the first Palace player to score a Premier League hat-trick and also set up a goal for Glenn Murray as Alan Pardew's team claimed a fourth successive win.Connor Wickham scored a late consolation for Sunderland, who were brought down to earth with a bump after beating derby rivals Newcastle United 1-0 on their previous outing.Bottom club Leicester City gave their hopes of avoiding relegation a huge boost by twice coming from behind to win 3-2 at West Bromwich Albion, which lifted Nigel Pearson's side to within three points of safety.David Nugent and Robert Huth successively cancelled out efforts by Darren Fletcher and Craig Gardner before Jamie Vardy charged to the edge of the West Brom box and drilled home an injury-minute winner for the Foxes."It was an exceptional goal (from Vardy), but we can't get carried away," said Leicester manager Pearson."It's great to get back-to-back wins, but we still have an awful lot to do."Jonjo Shelvey's penalty earned Swansea City a 1-1 draw with Everton, while Marko Arnautovic rescued a 1-1 draw for Stoke City at West Ham United, who had gone in front through a fine 25-yard free-kick from Aaron Cresswell.
South African teams rejoiced this weekend with three wins over Australian opposition as New Zealand's Wellington Hurricanes preserved a six-point lead at the top of Super Rugby.The Hurricanes and Waikato Chiefs had the weekend off with byes as did Australia's Melbourne Rebels with only South Africa's Northern Bulls closing some of the gap with a win.Australia's top two contenders, the ACT Brumbies and defending champions New South Wales Waratahs, both went down with the Waratahs to face the Hurricanes in Wellington next weekend.The Bulls overcame the Queensland Reds 43-22 in Pretoria to go third in the overall standings and complete a super Saturday for South African sides against Australian opponents.The Bulls' triumph followed wins for Western Stormers over the Waratahs in Sydney and Central Cheetahs over Western Force in Perth.The Brumbies missed their chance to close in on the Hurricanes in a 16-14 loss to the Blues in Auckland, while the Stormers had a strong 32-18 win over the Waratahs.The improving Otago Highlanders stunned the Canterbury Crusaders, coming from behind to take their New Zealand derby 25-20 in Christchurch to lie fifth overall.The Golden Lions won again after surviving a stoppage-time scare to defeat Coastal Sharks 23-21 in the all-South African game in Johannesburg to stand just one point outside the top-six playoff spots.The Cheetahs snapped their five-match losing streak with a 24-15 win over the embattled Force in Perth.In wet Auckland, the Blues snapped a seven-game drought with a late penalty by Ihaia West securing a two-point win over the Australian conference leading Brumbies.The Brumbies had a chance to win the match right on full-time only for Nic White's long-range penalty effort to fall short.Victory for the Bulls enabled them to bounce back after a last-minute Gauteng derby defeat by the Lions in Johannesburg the previous week.It was a sixth consecutive defeat for the bottom-of-the-table Reds and a seventh in eight games in the southern hemisphere inter-provincial championship.It was the first time the Highlanders beat the seven-time champion Crusaders in Christchurch since 2008 to keep them firmly in fifth place on the ladder, while the Crusaders dropped out of the top six.It also brought the Crusaders crashing down to earth after their comprehensive 52-8 win over the Sharks in South Africa last week.The Cape Town-based Stormers claimed their first win in Sydney since 2007 as they flustered the Waratahs with their straight line defence after trailing 15-13 at half-time.The Stormers went into the match losing their previous nine matches outside South Africa, but they grew in confidence in a tremendous second-half performance against the ragged Waratahs, with centre Damian de Allende scoring a double.The Lions, after building a nine-point lead early in the second half, looked set for victory before being rattled by a late Sharks comeback.Substitute prop Thomas du Toit barged over for a try two minutes from time which fly-half Fred Zeilinga converted.And Zeilinga had a chance to snatch victory after the full-time siren only to narrowly miss a prodigious 57-metre penalty attempt from close to the touchline.The Cheetahs trailed at half-time in Perth, but scored the last 16 points of the match to overpower the home side and claim their third win in eight games this season.The Force, who led 15-8 early in the second half, have now lost seven games in succession.
The daughter of Alec Campbell, Australia's last Anzac, is en route to Gallipoli where she will meet a descendant of the last Turkish veteran.Felicity Tangney will be among the thousands of Australians making the pilgrimage to Turkey to attend the centenary commemorations of the landing at Gallipoli.Mr Campbell was 69 years of age when his youngest child Felicity was born."It'll be amazing, an emotional experience I guess. I don't really know what to expect it's going to be like," she said as she prepared to leave.The youngest of nine children, Anzac Day was always an important one to Ms Tangney and the Campbell household."Dad always used to go and march and carry his flag and we'd go and watch him and it was always a big day," she said.This year will be particularly special for Ms Tangney."I'm really looking forward to seeing where dad was 100 years ago, it's amazing he was actually there 100 years ago."It will be Ms Tangney's first time on the Turkish peninsula."I want to see it all, I want to see the trenches, I want to see the beach where they landed, just the landscape, the people, everything," she said.Born in Launceston in 1899, Mr Campbell enlisted straight from school by claiming to be two years older than he actually was.He was just 16 when he landed on the beaches of Gallipoli.He fought with the 15th Battalion until forces evacuated. After falling ill, he returned to Australia and was discharged in 1916.He died in 2002 at the age of 103 and was honoured with a state funeral in Hobart.His death broke Australia's last living link with what was a defining battle on the Turkish peninsula."As an Australian, [the visit is] one of those sorts of things you want to do and for us especially because of dad," Ms Tangney said.In 1990, Mr Campbell made the trip back for the 75th anniversary of the landing."A marvellous trip, Gallipoli was wonderful, some places were a bit upsetting, I think we all enjoyed it tremendously," he reflected after the visit.Ms Tangney recalls how he found his trench and accidentally dropped his camera in it.In Ms Tangney's kit bag will be some precious memorabilia."I'll take a replica of his medals, I'll take his Campbell tartan scarf and will wear that to the dawn service, his flag that he used to march with, probably just a photo," she said.On a cruise from Greece to Turkey Ms Tangney will meet a descendant of the last Turkish veteran from the Gallipoli campaign."It'll be interesting to meet him and hear his stories.""I guess I'll ask about his ancestors and the people who were on Gallipoli, how he felt about it."Ms Tangey plans to give him a special medallion featuring her father, which was made to commemorate the ANZAC centenary.Tasmanian RSL president Robert Dick commemorated last ANZAC Day on the Western front where two of his uncles fought and died."I think it's going to be a very emotional time for her, I hope not too emotional but I'm sure she will appreciate the atmosphere and everything around her," he said."I think that's going to be a landmark meeting when you think what were, at one stage, foes in battle to suddenly be meeting up as friends in a significant event of remembrance of all [who] died at Gallipoli."A remembrance trip which will certainly be one to remember.
WASHINGTON - A man shot himself dead in front of the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, police said, sparking a temporary security lockdown at the complex on one of the busiest days for tourists in Washington.The man, who was wearing a backpack and had carried a rolling suitcase and a sign to the site, fired a single shot at himself, Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine told reporters.Dine said the man's sign had a "social justice" message but he did not immediately provide more details and did not release the man's name.Authorities said they placed the Capitol on a lockdown as a precaution. A bomb squad technician examined the suitcase and the backpack and officials later gave the all-clear, lifting the lockdown after about two hours."There seems to be no nexus to terrorism or anything related to that," Dine said.The incident occurred as Congress was out of session and few lawmakers were in town. But the city was crowded with tourists visiting for the popular annual Cherry Blossom festival.The disturbance blocked traffic but did not appear to disrupt most visitors to Washington.Robert Bishop, a real estate developer from Annapolis, Maryland, who was visiting Washington and was at the scene of the shooting, said the man who killed himself had a sign that he thinks said, "Tax the 1 percent."The deadline for Americans to submit their tax returns is Wednesday.The man shot himself next to a fountain between the Capitol building and a street. About 50 people were in the area at the time, Bishop said."Everybody started ducking and started to run," he said.Near the White House, about 2 miles (3 km) east of the Capitol, authorities moved tourists away from the grounds on Saturday afternoon as a precaution before later reopening the area, a law enforcement official said.Lawmakers are due to return to work on Monday.The shooting is the latest in a string of security incidents at high-profile buildings in the nation's capital.In 2013, police shot and killed a woman after she rammed security barricades with her car near the White House before racing toward the Capitol. Also in 2013, a government contractor opened fire at the Washington Navy Yard, killing 12 people.More recently, a man pleaded guilty to charges of running into the White House in September armed with a knife before being tackled, a security breach that helped lead to a shake-up in the U.S. Secret Service.
District Head of Wamakko in Wamakko local government area of Sokoto state, Alhaji Salihu BaradeThe District Head of Wamakko in Wamakko local government area of Sokoto state, Alhaji Salihu Barade, who was recently kidnapped and released Friday night, has called for the general improvement of the security in Nigeria.The 60-year old traditional ruler, who is the younger brother of Governor Aliyu Wamakko, was kidnapped April 8 by unknown gunmen in his farm in Wamakko local government area of the state and later released by his abductors on Friday, near the farm of the Emir of Gummi in Zamfara state.Speaking with newsmen in Wamakko council, the District Head said this was part of the measures to stem the tide of kidnappings and other crimes in the country. According to him, there was the need for the improvement of security in Nigeria and not only around the traditional rulers.The freed traditional ruler expressed gratitude to God for securing his safe release. He urged Nigerians to sustain fervent prayers for peace and unity in the country, describing his abduction as a fallout of the general insecurity in the country.“I could not eat food for two days and I could not pray as there was no water in the place they kept me. I cannot however tell you whether a ransom was paid or not as they seized all my handsets. In fact, as you can see I am hale and hearty but we were starving with my abductors as they took me to a forest,” he added.
In the build up to the presidential election, many clergies predicted various outcome of the presidential election. While some predicted war, bloodshed, incomplete election, crises and disintegration, others predicted victory for incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan, Michael Oche writesMost Nigerians who had relied on their clergies, be it pastors, Imams or prophets, would probably be disappointed with the outcome of the elections. Some ardent followers of these clergies who had relied on predictions of bloodshed were forced to relocate their families for fear of the unknown.Even some of the politicians had relied on the prophecies of victory from some of these clergies and gone to sleep rather than going about to woo voters. Some of the politicians were also worried when the prophecies didn’t come in their favour.Worried by some of the predictions and prophecies from men of God, President Jonathan on one of his visits to Living Faith Church, Canaan Land, urged Nigerians to pray for the country ahead of the general elections because of the scary predictions and prophecies.“There are various predictions concerning the election but I trust God to take control of the situation,” the president stated.The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), was forced to lambast Primate Theophilus Olabayo of the Evangelical Church of Yahweh, Maryland, Lagos, for predicting that the party would lose Lagos State governorship election in 2015.The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was also not left out of the attack on a clergy who didn’t prophesy in their favour. The party accused Rev. Father Ejike Mbaka of the Adoration Ministry in Enugu of collecting bribe from Senator Chris Ngige after the Catholic priest during his New Year prophecy declared that President Jonathan would lose the election.Though Mbaka would have the last laugh as his prophecy came true, not many other clergies were so ‘lucky’ to have theirs come to fulfillment. Perhaps, just as the former chairman of the Lagos State branch of the Nigerian Red Cross Society of Nigeria, Celestine Nwosu puts it, “God has a way of solving Nigerian problems.”Prophet Olaniyi Odutayo of the World Prophetic Church, Ikeja, had also predicted that, “God told me Jonathan will win the presidential election.”Odutayo, who had just concluded a 40-day fasting and prayers before making his predictions stated that, “during the prayer and fasting, the Lord showed me three men trying to bury Goodluck Jonathan. Each one of them trying to bury him one after the other but as they push his head down, he rises up again. When the third man pushed his head down, he thought he had prevailed, he was already jubilating but suddenly Goodluck rose up.“I believe this vision is telling us that the president will have three contenders in the coming election but he will prevail. No matter how tough it seems, President Goodluck will rule come 2015.”An Abuja-based prophet, Joshua Iginla, of the Champions Royal Assembly also prophesied thus: “No matter how powerful or well-organised the 2015 election is, it will be faulted. I am not a politician nor do I belong to any political party, I am just speaking God’s mind. The person sitting on the seat might not be perfect but he will retain the seat. It’s not guess-work. Howbeit, it will be a battle between the lion and the tiger. Shortly after the election, especially on the night of the election, there will be great vandalisation. I see cars being burnt, many killed.”He veered off from the 2015 election and talked about Goodluck Jonathan’s health and death in Aso Rock. “President Jonathan will win but he has to pray about his health and so many political blows. I pray the two people who enter the Aso Villa will leave together. That’s why we should pray for the woman beside the president. The president and his wife should pray that the first lady would finish the tenure together and not losing one before the end of their tenure,” he stated.For the General Overseer of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, Dr D.K Olukoya, it’s going to be a mysterious year. “I will speak in parables. This year is going to be a mysterious, cautious and dribbling year. So, you will have to find the solutions instead of diagnosing the problems carried by the year.”INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church founder, Primate Elijah Ayodele Babatunde was reported to have made an interesting prophecy on the general elections. “This year’s election will throw up a lot of issues. President Goodluck Jonathan will do everything to win a second term. However, he needs 14 days prayer to have a peaceful reign to enable him complete a second term. The chairman of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Attahiru Jega will be confused during the polls”, he stated.“There will be several gimmicks to cajole the INEC to rig the election. E-voting will not work. There will be ballot box snatching and stuffing during the election. The president should also commit his health and that of his wife to prayer. Jonathan is in the midst of enemies who are after his life,” he added.So far, only Pastor Tunde Bakare of the Latter Rain Assembly seems to have given hope about the election year. “Whether you are from the east, west, north or south, you will experience joy in 2015. Other nations will say ‘how did they do it?’ It will be indescribable joy. The nations of the earth will testify. I bring good tidings of joy to every part of the nation…”Apostle Johnson Suleiman of the Omega Fire Ministries Worldwide said, “I see President Goodluck Jonathan coming back but there was trouble. Patience Jonathan needs serious prayers. The 2015 presidential election will be rigged, marred in violence and end up in court case. 2015 election is another June 12.” He urged President Jonathan to be careful as there are plans to assassinate him.Despite the outcry of the men of God concerning the 2015 election, Pastor E.A. Adeboye of the Redeemed Christian Church of God while revealing his 2015 visions at the 2014 cross over night said: “Unfortunately, because it is election year, I can’t tell you the entire thing God told me about Nigeria. But I will tell you this, by the end of the year, many will say ‘all is well that ends well”.Indeed, the election turned out well for Nigeria and Nigerians.Speaking to LEADERSHIP Sunday, a civil servant, Adewale Kupoluyi, said one thing that is troubling was the seemingly conflicting prophecies from the clergies.“Then we should ask, is it not possible to have the same prediction since the ‘source’ of the message should be same, though the messenger may differ? Then what could have gone wrong and at what point?” he queried.Agaptus Okafor, a company driver said because of the predictions and prophecies, he had relocated his family of five to his village in Imo State till after the elections. Chukwuemeka Dike, a businessman and indigene of Enugu State said he has also taken his family members home following the scary predictions concerning the elections.
With a portrait in last year's Archibald Prize exhibition and as a finalist in several other art shows, Anh Do's artistic credentials would seem to be beyond doubt.But Do's gallery dealer Rex Irwin has been a tough judge to please."He came before last year's Archibald and he looked at all the work and he went 'This is pretty much all not good enough'," Do says. "And I said 'What about that one? That's my dad and I'm going to put him in the Archibald' and he said 'No, not very good'."Irwin is the co-owner of Olsen Irwin Gallery in Woollahra, which will host Do's first solo exhibition Man later this month.Far from being miffed, Do, who won last year's Kogarah Art Prize, says he asked Irwin to give his honest opinion."But this time a few weeks ago he said 'I must say they're very good'," he says. "And I think it's because it's the first time I've been able to string three months of painting together."The large canvases in Man feature Do's friends painted with thick swathes of paint. Each portrait in the show is numbered, rather than named, with the viewer left to work out the character, history and occupation of Do's faces."I picked them because they've really lived a big life," he says. "Lots of ups and lots of downs, probably more downs you know.""That's what sort of fascinates me," he adds. "What's funny as well as what's sad. What's the hero and the really cool dad and the flip side the alcoholic father."A renowned comedian, author and television personality, Do's skill as an artist was brought to wide attention last year with a touching portrait of his ailing father Tam."That's a son's painting of a dad that he worries he might not see again," Do told Fairfax Media last year.  Do told the story of his relationship with his father and the family's arduous journey to Australia as boatpeople in his award-winning 2010 autobiography, The Happiest Refugee, which he later turned into a stage show that he continues to perform. The latest edition of his travelogue series Anh Does Italy screens on the Seven Network later this year.An avid drawer in his school days, Do took up painting about four years ago, enrolling in a TAFE course following the death of a close friend.Besides Irwin, he also enlists a number of artist friends to critique his work."I'm trying to catch up," he says. "I started late and I'm trying to get as good as I can be. And I'm really enjoying it."If everyone gives their tick of approval to a painting, Do is satisfied."If it's half and half, then I get to decide if it's good or not," he says. "If they all go it's not good, I slash it and chuck it in the bin."Do credits his parents with encouraging him to chance his arm and not fear failure. He also speaks of the resilience he learned from his mother Hien, who raised three children single-handedly after Do's father succumbed to alcoholism and abandoned the family.As a teenager, Do was the family's spokesman, calling landlords to ask for extra time to pay the rent: "That gives you resilience so if I have to slash a painting or two so what?"Do admits his mother appreciates his art more than his humour."She doesn't really get it," he says. "She doesn't know why people are laughing. She doesn't understand smart-arsedness. But she can look at a painting and go 'You know what? That's good'."Do's four children are also fans of his work, venturing downstairs to his studio housed in the double garage, with enviable views of the Illawarra coast, to help out their father."Every now and then I'll get a visit from one of the little tackers and they try to help out, you know," he says. "They'll give me hints and tips and, they know nowadays not to, but when my youngest was four a couple of times he got in and thought he'd fix up a guy's chin."Do says he will often slip downstairs in the middle of the night to work on a painting – a lesson taught to him by "an angry girlfriend"."I've learnt that the muse is like an angry girlfriend," he says. "If she comes knocking you better be home because if you're not, she doesn't leave a note saying pick up after 3pm from the post office. The gift she had is gone forever."Anh Do's Man is at Olsen Irwin Gallery from April 22 to May 10.
UN Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-Moon  The United Nations on Saturday launched an appeal to raise slightly over $174 million to support Nigerian refugees who have fled to Chad, Niger and Cameroon to escape Boko Haram Islamist insurgency.The UN’s Regional Humanitarian Coordinator for the Sahel region, Robert Piper, said this to newsmen in Dakar, according to a Reuters and News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report. Report says Boko Haram fighters have killed thousands of people in their six-year bid to create an Islamist emirate in north eastern Nigeria. “Though a military campaign by Nigeria and its neighbours has driven Boko Haram out of many positions it previously held. The UN still expects refugee numbers to rise from 192,000 to 240,000 by the end of this year. The refugees, some of whom walked or even swam long distances to escape the violence,” he noted.He said they were spread out across the countries bordering Lake Chad in a mostly arid zone that encompassed some of the poorest regions of the world.He added that most of them were sheltering with local residents, rather than in refugee camps, partly out of fear of becoming targets for cross-border reprisal attacks.“Boko Haram has been so vicious in targeting civilians that there is a psychosis among the refugees. But this means they are spread out and logistically it is much more difficult to reach them,” he said.The 23 UN agencies and NGOs involved in the support plan each drew up their cost estimates, which came to a combined $174.4 million.According to the UN, in addition to the refugees, there are over 1.1 million people displaced within northeast Nigeria by Boko Haram.

The Federal Government has been urged to quickly look into the activities of idol worshippers and their priests, which is fast causing devastating havoc in the country.The call was made by Evangelist Maduabuchi Obumneke of St. Luke’s Anglican Church, Kuje, Abuja. Obumneke, while briefing newsmen.He appealed to the government, both at state and federal levels, to act as refuge for the fallen and would-be fallen victims of a ‘worthless religion’ that is full of wicked, cruel, barbaric and diabolical activities that is thwarting human rights and freedom of worship.According to him, “There was this kind of havoc caused by worshippers and priest of an idol in a shrine in Amori Town in Nkanu South Local Government Area of Enugu State last month which was just a replica of what happened some years ago, and to be precise, it was on Sunday 22nd July, 2007 in Adum Shrine at Oloibiri village in Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa State that caused the death of Pastor Kadiri who was in charge of Real Soul Gospel Church in the village.“Pastor Kadiri was mysteriously killed alongside his helper and guardian of some members of the church he was pastoring simply because he refused to partake in the activities of worshipping the idol in Adum shrine as his forefathers did.“These silent killings in the name of idol worshipping or any other form should be addressed for the sake of the country, its growth and development”, he added.

Intense lobbying for the position of the Senate president’s seat has been the focal point of political discussions since the National Assembly elections held on March 28. STANLEY NKOCHA writes on the intrigues, power play and likely candidates shaping the race.That a new order has been enthroned in the political system of the country, especially as it affects the leadership of the National Assembly, is not in doubt. The recent majority status attained by the All Progress Congress (APC) after gaining majority votes at the just concluded National Assembly elections, ensured this new order.As it is, no soothsayer is needed to state that realignments of positions and offices will take place to enable the new order take its due course.The eighth senate session of the National Assembly would take off early June, 2015, after it must have been proclaimed by the clerk of the assembly, who would preside over the elections of the four presiding officers of the two chambers of Nigeria’s highest lawmaking body namely: senate president, speaker, deputy senate president and the deputy speaker of the House of Representatives.Suffice to say that, with the president and vice president from the North-west and South-west respectively, the positions up for grab in the National Assembly would be filled by the North-central and North-east geo political zones. The South-south and South-east are as it stands, out of the contest, following the inability of the two zones to return any ranking member of the two chambers of the National Assembly under the platform of the APC.It is important to note that the standing rules of the Senate gives preference to seniority of senators for the positions of senate and deputy senate presidents. In fact, it bars new members from aspiring to hold these positions. This is so because, in the wisdom of the Senate, only senators with cognate parliamentary experience can effectively lead the upper legislative chamber and examples are drawn from advance democracies like the United States of America as well as India.The seniority/ranking factor was first tasted in 2007 when the current senate president, David Mark, first contested the number three position in order of protocol against the current senate minority leader, Senator George Akume and defeated him even though ranking was not yet included in the senate’s standing rules. But within the life of that very assembly, under the leadership of David Mark, it was imperative to insert the clause in the standing rules of the red chamber so as to properly guide lawmakers and possibly limit the contest to only experienced senators for effective leadership.It was then first applied as a written rule in 2011 when the likes of Senator Danjuma Goje from Gombe State, who was elected into the senate for the first term, was prevailed upon to drop his ambition to vie for the office of the senate president, hence David Mark, from the ruling PDP emerged unopposed.As the race for the Senate presidency hots up, and with APC winning the majority seats in the senate, the North-west and South-west having produced the president and Commander-In-Chief and, vice president respectively, it is a direct contest between the North-central and the North-east, featuring Senate minority leader, George Akume, who would be returning to the Senate the third time and Senator Bukola Saraki, who would be making a second return to the red chamber from Benue and Kwara States respectively, from the North-central zone.From the North-east, it would be between Senator Ahmed Lawan (Yobe) and Senator Bukar Abba Ibrahim (Yobe). Both would be coming back the third time as well as Danjuma Goje from Gombe State who would be returning a second time.Given the standard set by the president of the Senate, David Mark, in the last eight years as chairman of the National Assembly, his dexterity and deep understanding of the legislative procedures as well as the ability to navigate through tough political terrains to bridge the gap between parliament and executive have placed him in a class of his own. The need for a senate president that is humble, a team player, stabiliser as well as one that is respected amongst his colleagues, irrespective of political party differences, is the task before the APC which is expected to zero in on a candidate as consensus and avoid elections.Therefore, as the build up to the inauguration of the eighth National Assembly gets under way, three names have prominently featured in the calculations and permutations for the senate presidency and deputy senate president. They include the Senate minority leader, Senator George Akume (Benue ); Senator Ahmed Lawan (Yobe) and Senator Abubakar Bukola Saraki (Kwara).Senator George Akume Senator Akume is the current Senate minority leader from Benue State. He was first elected into the Senate on the platform of the PDP in 2007 and secured a second term under the platform of the defunct ACN now APC in 2011. He will be returning to the red chamber for the third time.He was a former governor of Benue State between 1999 and 2007. It would be recalled that Senator Akume laid the structure for the opposition in the state through the enormous goodwill he enjoyed and still enjoys from the people of the state. He is a well-respected member of the Nigerian parliament among his colleagues. He is a team player with robust relationship at all levels. His eight years in the parliament has equipped him for the job of Senate presidency and that huge experience would certainly come to bear. He is also in the good books of the APC leadership at the national level. Senator Akume is favoured by the zoning arrangement and party strength in the senate. Senator Akume is a Christian.A former member of the House of Representatives, Senator Lawan was first elected into the Senate in 2007 and since then, he has been the chairman of the Senate Committee on Public Accounts. He is also a well respected parliamentarian and a team player as well. He is said to be thorough in his dealings. Senator Lawan has not held any leadership position at the level of the executive but he has spent more years in the parliament cumulatively than Akume and Saraki. Some analysts have argued that senator Ahmed, who hails from Yobe State is well favoured by the zoning arrangement bearing in mind that the North-east zone has not produced the Senate president since the advent of democracy in 1999. Some are, however, of the view that the emergence of Ahmed as Senate president would narrow the space in the zoning of the offices of the speaker, deputy senate president and deputy speaker, particularly while considering religious factor. He is a Muslim.Senator Saraki, a former governor of kwara State between 2003 and 2011, was first elected a senator in 2011 under the platform of the PDP. He would be returning to the Senate for the second term under the APC platform having decamped from the PDP earlier. Well favoured by the zoning arrangement, he is also qualified as a ranking senator who is said to be brilliant and well composed. He is also respected among his colleagues. He is a Yoruba Muslim.An analyst highly conversant with the workings of the National Assembly, Andrew Oota asserts that except a choice is carefully made, it may be difficult balancing the religious interest in the National Assembly and polity at present as the APC has received several bashings in this respect in the past.Pundits are of the same opinion that should Senator Bukola Saraki emerge Senate president from the North-central zone as a Yoruba Muslim, it would be difficult to balance the religious factor in the North-east, since all the senators from that region are Muslims unlike the House of Representatives where a ranking member, Representative Yakubu Dogara is a Christian from Bauchi.It is therefore said in many quarters that the emergence of Senator Akume from the North-central would be the sure way of expanding the options for the APC in both chambers, having put all considerations in place.As intense lobbying and consultations are ongoing, it would not be long before the clear favorites emerge. It is expected that a consensus arrangement may be adopted in chosing the leaders as the APC may not be open to election, which is always known to provide room for divisions in every hitherto peaceful political party.
No fewer than 28 persons were reported dead in various states across the country as governorship and states Houses of Assembly elections held.Eight persons, including a policeman, were killed yesterday before actual voting started in Rivers State.The policeman was killed in the morning at the Rex-Lawson area of the old Port Harcourt Township even before accreditation commenced.Though the cause of the cop’s death was not known, the State Police Public Relations Officer, PPRO, Ahmad Muhammad, who confirmed the killing, said there were traces of violence before the policeman died.Muhammad said, “The policeman killed was one of thos e deployed to monitor the elections today (Saturday). We saw that there was evidence of violence before he was killed. His remains have been moved from to a nearby morgue and we have commenced investigation into the killing.”The police image maker further explained that over 17, 000 policemen were deployed to monitor the poll across the state, with a minimum of two policemen at each polling unit.It was gathered that one person was beheaded, while two others were shot dead in Asari-Toru local government area of the state.Hoodlums also stormed INEC office and reportedly threw substances suspected to be dynamite into the office, destroying election materials andThough the cause of the killings was not immediately ascertained, there were indications that it may not be unconnected with the power tussle between the two main political parties in the state.Also, eyewitnesses said there were heavy shootings on Friday night preceding the election up until about 7am yesterday morning in Buguma, headquarters of Asari-Toru local government area, with supporters of parties spotted burning tyres on the main roads.The situation heightened tension in the area, while many residents stayed at home for fear of being hit by stray bullets.Meanwhile, in Rumuomasi, a reporter with Channels Television, Grace Ekang, and his photographer were attacked and beaten by angry youths. The details of the attack were not clear.Also, in Bomu, Gokana local government area, a reporter with Silverbird Rhythm FM, Ofonime Okon, was beaten by thugs who asked if he was sent by a particular governorship candidate in the state. The vehicle he was travelling in was damaged.Also, in Okpogo community, Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government area, a group of youths reportedly snatched ballot boxes, while two unidentified men were shot dead.In Odual local government area, there were shootings which resulted in the loss of one life, though the police are yet to confirm this report. Policemen and other security personnel were spotted along Omuku town looking for hoodlums who allegedly snatched ballot boxes.It was also gathered that the state commissioner for women affairs, Mrs Joyba West, was attacked by hoodlums and her home burnt down.Her information and communications counterpart, Mrs Ibim Semenitari, who confirmed the attack on Mrs West, said her colleague was still in hiding.Meanwhile, Governor Chibuike Amaechi and his wife, Judith, after being accredited at ward in Ubima, Ikwerre local government area, described the election in the state as a sham.Amaechi told journalists that the governorship and House of Assembly elections were characterized by ballot box snatching, intimidation and harassment.He also disowned text messages allegedly traced to him calling on Rivers people not to vote and for the election to be cancelled. He said his phone number must have been cloned.Mrs Semenitari, who spoke for the governor, said her principal had at no time called on INEC to cancel the polls.In Oyigbo local government area, explosion from substances suspected to be dynamite went off near a polling unit, but voters defied the scare and later went to be accredited before 1pm.In Kano State, thugs suspected to be hired by unscrupulous politicians burnt ballot papers and attempted to snatch election materials in Madobi and Kibiya local government areas of Kano State, respectively.The state commissioner of police, Ibrahim Idris, confirmed that violence broke out at Kaura-Mata in Madobi local government area where political thugs burnt ballot papers and boxes.In a separate telephone interview with the police spokesman in Kano, ASP Magaji Musa Majiya revealed that what caused chaos at Kauran-Mata was that a PDP ward leader, Kauran Mata, specifically tore a ballot paper and requested his hired thugs to disrupt the process.However, INEC, Resident Electoral Commissioner, Alhaji Hussaini Halilu Pai told our reporter that in the early hours of yesterday, suspected hired thugs attempted to snatch election materials in Kibiya local government area while officials were on their way to Kahu ward.According to him, police quick intervention prevented the youth from carrying out their evil plan.Also, in Kebbi State, soldiers yesterday allegedly shot dead three people in Suru local government of Kebbi State after pandemonium broke out during the polls.According to an eyewitness who spoke to LEADERSHIP SUNDAY on condition of anonymity, the incident occurred at a village called Bayan Dutsi when voters suspected the INEC supervisor in the area of malpractice and descended on him, beating him to coma.The eyewitness explained that following the incident, soldiers were called in to restore order, but the angry voters, most of whom youths, threw stones at the soldiers, prompting the soldiers to open fire, killing three.Police public relations officer in the state, Nafiu Abubakar, confirmed the incident and said it would be investigated.“Yes the incident happened but you see I am in Birnin Kebbi for election work but it will be investigated”, he said.A similar incident of killing also occurred at Kanya in Danko Wasagu local government of Kebbi State when unknown gunmen shot dead one Umaru Gomma, a renowned APC politician in the area. Reports said the gunmen stormed his residence and opened fire on him.On his part, former governor of Akwa Ibom, Obong Victor Atta, described the governorship and House Assembly elections in the state as a sham and a disgrace to electoral process.Atta told newsmen he monitored the polls at his country home in Ibeskpo Asutan local government area, but that he was not even allowed to vote as thugs with the support of some unscrupulous security operatives brazenly carried off all electoral materials from his ward.“This is a monumental evil, and a rape on democracy. I cannot believe my eyes on seeing what happened in my dear state today. Thugs hired by the ruling party in the state, the PDP, came directly to my unit and removed all the election materials and bolted, leaving the people who had come to vote, perplexed”, he said.Atta lamented the agony of his people who were prevented from performing their civil right and called on the INEC to cancel the elections because of irregularities that pervaded the whole exercise.Meanwhile, over five persons were said to have lost their lives at different locations during the governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state.A middle-aged man was reported killed at Nsit Ibium local government area, the home of the state APC governorship candidate, Umana Okon Umana, who called for an outright cancellation of the elections in the state.Umana, who made the call while addressing journalists in his country home, Ndiya, said that elections could not hold in several polling units across the state because of malpractices and intimidation by PDP thugs who allegedly hijacked materials.He explained that hired thugs carried off all the election materials meant for his ward and other units in the local government area.“Reports from our men on the field indicate that there was massive invasion of all polling stations by thugs and agents of the PDP,” he stated.In Uyo, the state capital, LEADERSHIP SUNDAY reports that two youths were shot dead as they engaged thugs who had invaded their polling units on Ikot Ekpene road.There were also reports that three people died in Imo State, while Ebonyi, Cross River, Plateau, Katsina and Benue states lost an individual each.
Whether you are a graduate new to the workforce, or looking to move to the next stage in your career progression, the process of looking for the perfect job is a daunting one, particularly in the digiworld's uncertain and unstable atmosphere.Corporations are constantly evolving to fit in with the rapid flow of market fluctuations, technological advances and world events. There's every chance that by the time the application process is complete, the position you have gone for has either completely changed in scope or even changed location.So how do you as a jobseeker put key strategies in place to make certain you are protected against outside forces battering your 'definitely will bes' into 'might have beens'?One of the best ways to futureproof your chances of career success is to think and act collaboratively at a commercial level. If you take an isolationist approach to stepping up the career ladder, then a common sense perspective says that you are automatically missing out on opportunities for advancement.Collaboration within the business sphere – or what could be called the 'We' space as opposed to the 'Me' space – means taking the opportunity to engage and ideate with big thinkers, mentors, sponsors and leaders who can assist your journey upward. More than that, it means connecting with others who share the same business ethics, values and ideals as yourself, and creating a network that will stand you in good stead for the long trek.If you are looking from a graduate perspective to your first role, then a good place to start is by identifying both peers and leading figures you admire in your sector or industry. Is there the opportunity for mentoring, even if you don't yet have a position? Engaging at this level not only indicates that you are ahead of the pack when it comes to wanting to succeed, it also starts good habits in terms of leadership style and strategic thinking. It may also show you more clearly what you don't want in terms of career objectives.If you are in the market for a new role, then look to the company's sponsorship record. Do they have an active history of encouraging sponsorship and mentoring? Sponsorship in particular can have a massive impact on career progression, with both the sponsor and the recipient investing time, effort and an expectation of return into the relationship. Are you ready to accept a two-way relationship? If so, then look to sponsorship as part of your collaborative approach to a new role.This in turn leads to your network. It actually doesn't matter where you are in the company tree; the bottom or the top – networks are a vital way of not only supporting your progression, but also your career and personal growth. Networking, when done the right way – with a focus on what you give, rather than what you are going to get – brings understanding of a team environment and other industries, professions and sectors. It allows you to form relationships both within and without your own workplace. Above all, networks can upskill you, which is invaluable when you are looking to move on career wise.If you close yourself off to an understanding of what it means to work with others at two critical points of your career path – the beginning and the progression – then inevitably you will be behind the eight-ball compared to others who have opened themselves up to working in a collaborative environment.The temptation to think 'I can do it all myself' might be great – but just think about those who have had the biggest success stories. Steve Jobs didn't have a company called 'Jobs'. Richard Branson didn't have 'Richard'. There's a reason why Apple and Virgin are the brands they are.  The teams behind them.Janine Garner is the author of From Me To We – Why commercial collaboration will future-proof business, leaders and personal success. She is the Founder and CEO of LBDGroup and works with senior leaders to build high performing teams.

Three years ago, they were filmed kicking and screaming as Australian Federal Police removed them from their mother. But the Vincenti sisters, who were forcibly sent from Australia to Italy to be with their father, have now revealed they are happy living with him overseas.There was a widespread outcry when footage of the four sisters being forcibly taken from the Sunshine Coast home of Australian woman Laura Garrett to live with their father was aired in 2012.The sisters – aged just nine to 15 years old at the time – were shown kicking and screaming as AFP officers dragged them from their mother's home and forced them on to a plane.The scene in 2012 when the girls were taken away by police.Born and raised in Italy, the girls had been at the centre of a custody battle since their mother brought them to Australia in 2010.In a 60 Minutes interview due to air on Sunday in Australia, the two eldest sisters, Emily and Claire, aged now 16 and 17, described what it was like to be wrenched from their mother."That night, they came all of a sudden and took us away and it was traumatising… I didn't want to get on the plane. It's the truth, I didn't want to go back to Italy," Emily told Channel Nine.Claire said she believed her mother had taken them from Italy because she wanted to return home."I just think [at] that point mum wanted to return home. That's why she did it I think," she said.The picture of the two girls seemingly happy and settled living in a village near Florence is a stark contrast to the traumatic scenes from when they first arrived and pleaded to return to Australia.Garrett raised nearly A$10,000 in online donations to  get her girls back after the case went public.The girls' parents met when Garrett was an exchange student in Italy. Her host family were the parents of Tomaso Vincenti, the girl's father.The pair married and had four girls, but in 2007, when the youngest daughter was only four years old, the couple split.Under Italian law, both parents were granted joint custody.However, in 2010, Ms Garrett took the four girls back to Australia, telling their father she wanted to take them for a holiday for a month.Garrett reportedly told the Australian embassy she was fleeing an abusive husband.The four daughters remained in Queensland for two years while their father fought to bring them back to Italy.Now, according to the Channel Nine program, the girls are attending school, planning to study at university and have Italian boyfriends in Florence.According to the show, the four Vincenti sisters had not seen their mother since they were removed but Ms Garrett has subsequently visited them in Italy when 60 Minutes went to film the story.
If working in a corporate environment has taught me one thing it's that crushing disappointment of the professional variety is always lurking just around the corner like some creepy, heavy-breathing degenerate, ready to jump out and put you in a foul-smelling, absurdly long headlock.Sorry if that sounds unduly pessimistic, but unless you've found a triple-A-rated, once-in-every-four-lifetimes job – come on! You know I'm not exaggerating. And if you have found that job, what are you doing reading this column? Go out and cavort with Staffordshire terrier puppies in a thornless rose garden, you lucky bugger.The hardest part about these disappointments is that they never get easier to bear. Unless, of course, you've developed callouses. And you can't develop these callouses from work alone. You need to have something else in your life that inoculates you against the consistent and profound feeling that you've been thoroughly let down. For me it's football.You don't know relenting despondency until you've supported an elite-level sporting team that almost never plays at anything near the elite level – the Melbourne Football Club.It's just one moment of jaw-dropping, soul-pulping incompetence or incomprehensibly bad luck after another. For years it's agonising, and then you find yourself becoming anaesthetised to it all. Things that were once tormenting become mildly bemusing. You learn to embrace a certain perverse equanimity. Work travails pale into insignificance by comparison.Yes, nothing can prepare you for the vagaries and vicissitudes of corporate life like investing yourself in the success of a team like Melbourne. So, am I telling you to switch your allegiance to the Demons in a bid to overcome the inevitable disillusionment of corporate life? In a word: yes.

The Raptors formally ended an NBA era on the shores of Biscayne Bay on Saturday, sticking a stake through the heart of the once-mighty Miami Heat in a dreary affair.Against what was left of the Heat, Toronto all but eliminated Miami from the playoff picture in a 107-101 victory that tied the franchise record of 48 wins, set last year.DeMar DeRozan had never won in Miami in 10 tries and left for a bit after taking a hard fall in the third, but returned to close the game and said he was fine. Not only did DeRozan return, he hit a tough driving layup with less than two minutes remaining in a razor-tight game for the second night in a row, hitting the free throw as well to give Toronto a 99-94 advantage with 1:21 left to play.With the lead down to two, Lou Williams, the best Raptor all evening, calmly sank a three-pointer, then made his way to the corner to block a Luol Deng three-point attempt to seal the deal.The Raptors clinched home-court advantage in the first round of the playoffs and tied a franchise record with 22 road wins this season and they are feeling mighty pleased about those accomplishments.There is a strong case to be made that Williams has been the NBA’s top sixth man this season and this two-night Florida sojourn has provided a lot of ammunition to that argument.“Yeah, I’m having a pretty good week, but this one especially, feels good,” Williams said, saying the Raptors set a goal of home court and 50 wins before the season.“It’s my first time ever having home-court in my 10-year career, so I look forward to it ... (the ACC) is going to be rocking.“We’ve got to appreciate having home court, these guys fought for it, they scratched for it,” added head coach Dwane Casey.“They earned it. I think you’ve got to honour that and appreciate that, not be satisfied but appreciate that for our organization.”Williams finished with 29 points, DeRozan added 22 and the Raptors needed all of that offence, with Kyle Lowry struggling again in his second game back after missing nine-of-10. Lowry shot just 3-for-14, including 0-for-8 from three, but Tyler Hansbrough played well again and Terrence Ross turned in a solid 17 minutes.Hassan Whiteside was unstoppable for Miami, with 16 points and 18 rebounds, but he missed 12-of-16 free throw attempts, nearly negating all of the good work. Dwyane Wade’s 30 points were not enough as the Heat missed 20 free throws in all.Miami had won 16-of-17 against Toronto coming in and had been pretty dominant against the rest of the league as well, making four straight trips to to the NBA Finals in the LeBron James era, with two title wins. It is a strange thing to see a superpower crumble, but you just can’t replace a talent like James. Injuries to Chris Bosh and others didn’t help either.But the future looks bright for the Raptors, even if one of the young cornerstones — Valanciunas — picked up two early fouls, forcing an early exit for the third game in a row.It’s not a coincidence that Valanciunas has struggled defensively without old reliable Amir Johnson beside him. Johnson missed his fourth straight.Valanciunas could only play 10 minutes before fouling out, giving a dismissive thumbs up to the officiating staff as he made his way to the bench.The Heat led by two after three quarters in a truly ugly contest, marred by non-stop parades to the free throw line for both sides and the fourth was tight all the way through, but the Raptors did enough to pull it out.“We got some timely stops,” Williams said of the final minutes.“Our two captains did a great job. I looked up and Kyle had three or four big rebounds in a row where we got stops. DeMar made some big shots like the and-one we needed it. And I made that shot at the end. I think everybody did what they’re supposed to.”The Raptors were coming off of a tight, 101-99 win in Orlando the night before.DeRozan scored 29 in that one and found Williams for the game-winning three-pointer.
When the National Troupe of Nigeria decided to stage the musical titled, “Spectacle’’, the first thought was:  “Why spectacle?’’ For any theatre artiste, spectacle as a title is as commonplace as drama, comedy or song. But looking at the content of the four-part piece, it is a mirror of the Nigerian state and there really is no better word to describe it other than spectacle. Naturally, the view on stage was beautiful. For the first time in a long while, people were turned back at the door of the cinema hall two where the performance took place. The hall was full beyond its capacity and it was pointless to admit more persons to occupy the aisle. That was good news. There was a time when brilliant performances would only attract a few but last Easter held a different tale for the theatre.The performances began with the group performance of Nigerian folk-songs. Songs transporting the audience from Ilaje to Tiv and Fulani land, making a detour along the coast of cross river to head for the eastern side, were performed. They were richly covered in descriptive costumes, some traditional while others are contemporary. The sight was not a bore rather it was a reminder of the beauty in our national unity which is the theme of the performance.It was not just the tribal diversities that were showcased. The varieties of artistic elements of the African performance space were explored such as dance, songs, narratives, mime, masks and chants. Individual performances shone through the group performance. According to Shuaibu Husseini, who is a member of the National Troupe, some of the artists joined the troupe for different reasons. Those who came in as singers ended up dancing or drumming. The point is that the troupe trains artists to be well-rounded. If the performances were anything to go by, one could safely conclude that there are less limitations to what can be performed on stage. National theatre has been known for fully-scripted drama, performed in the same old strait-jacket framework for performing art. But, the variety show allowed for self-development and limitless talent display.Consider the couple, who are actually couple in real life, who performed the acrobatic dance cum ballet. They told their story through dance and movements. From their view, the marital union is a continuous performance requiring duo effort to sustain. Trust is a crucial element for the marriage institution to survive. In the dance, the husband would suspend the wife in the air with his legs and turn her around and between his legs to the audience’s astonishment. The wife would exercise trust to make this possible. In reality, a lot of decisions may be taken by the husband that could alter the life of the wife. It may take the wife’s trust to support the husband on such decisions and the end result will look like a perfect finish, even if it isn’t. That was the nature of the expressive duo performance.Have you seen obsession yet? Well, it came in form of a dancer on stage that evening. After a group performance, this dance freak kept at it and she was simply electrifying. Her husband in the sketch tried to stop her so that they could go home but she wouldn’t budge. Eventually, the husband joined her in the dance and led her home cleverly. Maybe that is another marital tip expressed in dance that even when the wife is stubborn, the husband may have to stoop to conquer. The artistic director and CEO, National Troupe of Nigeria, Akin Adejuwon, was thankful to the President, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan for his unwavering support for the theatre. He also commended the cast and crew for their commitment to the production in making it a success.
WASHINGTON - Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her candidacy for US president Sunday, ending prolonged speculation that she once again seeks to become the first woman elected to the White House.Seven years after her bitter nomination defeat to Barack Obama, the former secretary of state and one-time first lady would enter the race as the Democratic Party's overwhelming favorite, as Clinton and her rivals gird for a bruising, 18-month campaign slog.Her announcement is expected to be delivered via social media -- perhaps in a tweet -- and accompanied by a campaign kickoff video highlighting her economy-focused political philosophy, according to US news outlets citing sources close to Clinton operations.It is likely to trigger a donor deluge from a vast network of supporters who have long waited for her to officially enter the race, a move that would allow them to contribute directly to her 2016 election effort.Clinton's campaign-in-waiting has organized for months behind the scenes, bringing on key staffers and advisors, plotting outreach operations and strategizing.On Saturday, the campaign team hunkered down in Clinton headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, where upcoming campaign manager Robby Mook reportedly delivered a memo to staff urging teamwork in the months ahead."We are a diverse and talented family... and have each other's backs," the memo states, according to Politico, perhaps in an effort to avoid the infighting among top aides that marred Clinton's 2008 run.The 2016 campaign goal, the memo adds, is "to give every family, every small business, and every American a path to lasting prosperity by electing Hillary Clinton the next president of the United States."On Saturday, she earned high praise from Obama himself."She was a formidable candidate in 2008. She was a great supporter of mine in the general election. She was an outstanding secretary of state. She is my friend," Obama said at a regional summit in Panama."I think she would be an excellent president."Her Sunday announcement is expected to be followed by low-key campaign swings through Iowa and New Hampshire, states that hold the first votes early next year to determine the parties' nominees.Clinton, 67, already has a team of organizers in Iowa, a fertile political proving ground ahead of national elections.After the campaign launch, Clinton should "jump on a bus and barnstorm through Iowa touching all 99 counties and meet with people in cafes and other small venues" as she reintroduces herself to Americans, Iowa State University professor Steffen Schmidt told AFP.The one-time US senator and wife of former president Bill Clinton leads opinion polls among Democrats, some 60 percent of whom say they would vote for her in the primaries, according to the website RealClearPolitics.A humble approach may help dispel doubts about Clinton raised in recent weeks, after it was revealed she used a private email account while secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.But she could face uncomfortable questions about the issue from voters, including why she deleted thousands of emails that she described as personal, then wiped her server clean.Clinton would be the biggest political headliner to enter the race, although not the first.Conservative Republican Senator Ted Cruz, 44, made a splashy presidential campaign launch last month, and on April 7 fellow Senator Rand Paul, a libertarian-leaning first-term Republican, threw his hat in the ring.Clinton's rollout may well steal the thunder of another Republican senator aiming for the White House, Marco Rubio, who is scheduled on Monday to make his own all-but-certain campaign declaration.Ex-Florida governor Jeb Bush, son and brother of two presidents, is exploring a run and would be considered a Republican frontrunner should he enter the fray.
At around 4.30pm on Saturday at Augusta National golf club, a mighty roar signalled the news the golfing world had feared would never come. Tiger Woods was back, mixing it with the best and proving he was capable of increasing his haul of 14 majors some time soon.Woods had just holed from four metres for birdie on one of Augusta's most magnificent holes, the 13th, after being in a seemingly impossible position off the tee. As the crowd cheered, he pumped his fist. And when he collected the ball from the bottom of the cup, he pumped his fist again. That birdie took him to seven under par and although Jordan Spieth was still galloping away in the distance, it was clear Woods had refound his mojo.The dozen deep crowd was so lost in the occasion that several lost all sense of perspective. Later, as Woods stood over a putt for a birdie on the 17th that would have taken him to eight under, one suggested: "This could be the tournament clincher."He missed and bogeyed 18, but that was of little consequence.Woods finished his third round in a tie for fifth, a distant 10 shots behind Spieth, but it is clear he is delighted with how his return to competitive golf after nine weeks has gone. He had improved his score in each of his first three rounds (73-69-68) and recorded his first consecutive sub-70 scores here since 2005, the last time he won at Augusta."I've gotten better each day," said Woods, who hasn't won a tournament since 2013 and a major since 2008. "I'd give myself a good grade."I had my chances to make this a really special round. A realistic score would have been six or seven (under), they way I played."What I've done all week has been pretty good, from where I've come from."Having to change my entire release pattern. People have no idea how hard that is to do."To come back here and to play a major championship and be in the mix. I'm happy."There is a growing feeling at Augusta that golf is healthier now than it has been for several years - and that will be boosted further by Woods' re-emergence."We need Tiger to be playing great," said world No.6 Adam Scott.  "It's good for golf. A lot of guys are playing really well. And I think we need him up there, as well. It makes the game what it is."It was somewhat ironic that Woods signalled his return as a force paired with a player whose company he'd prefer not to keep.The animosity between Woods and Sergio Garcia goes back to the 1999 US PGA championship, in which Woods beat the Spaniard by a shot. Since then they have clashed several times, notably two years ago, culminating in Garcia insulting Woods by saying if he came round for dinner he'd serve him fried chicken.Before they reunited, Garcia was at pains to play down any suggestion there would be friction.'@TigerWoods and I might not be best friends but we do respect each other and that respect will stay the same today!' he tweeted.The pair barely seemed to exchange a word and walked well apart on almost every fairway. Woods distanced himself from his long-time rival on the scoreboard as well, beating him by three shots.Afterwards Garcia admitted that he likes to "chit chat a little bit" but said he and Woods simply exchanged pleasantries. "Mainly it was saying good shot, well done, good putt, good birdie. Things like that. Normal stuff, but I thought we were both very good. It was the way it should be."Everybody makes this a bigger deal than it is for us," he said.One senses any issue with the relationship is a bigger deal for Garcia than it is for Woods.The American was scheduled for another blockbuster pairing on the final day, with world No.1 Rory McIlroy. And if either was to make a charge, Spieth said he knew he'd hear about it.
The mother of a heavily pregnant teenager killed when her fiance crashed their car is devastated after a charge against the P-plate driver was dropped yesterday.Shona Leigh Caley, 19, and her unborn baby girl were killed when 18-year-old Alex John Riley allegedly lost control of their Mitsubishi Lancer on a bend on Brookton Highway and hit a tree on February 24 last year.Ms Caley was seven months pregnant and the couple had just been in Perth celebrating the impending birth of their first daughter at a baby shower with family and friends.They were returning to their home in Corrigin when the car driven by Mr Riley left the road, rolled several times and crashed into a tree.Almost three months after the crash, Mr Riley was charged with dangerous driving in circumstances which resulted in a death.But in Perth Magistrate's Court yesterday, prosecutors discontinued the charge against Mr Riley.Ms Caley's mother Jen Higgins said she did not understand why Mr Riley was able to get away "scot-free" when the crash had claimed the lives of her daughter and unborn granddaughter."All I know is he is getting on with his life," Ms Higgins said."He has never said sorry."Ms Higgins said the past year had been hard. She said the decision by prosecutors to drop the charge had revived the trauma of Ms Caley's death and left the family feeling that they had been denied justice."There is not much that we can do but try to put the pieces back together and get on with our lives without Shona," she said. "We have spent the last 12 months trying to repair ourselves and it is not going to happen."It would have been her 21st this year, but I don't get to spend her 21st with her. It is every Christmas, it is each Easter and birthdays and Mother's Day. But he gets to spend his with his family."A statement from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions said that "on the available evidence, the DPP concluded there were no reasonable prospects of conviction".Mr Riley declined to comment when he left court.'All I know is he is getting on with his life. He has never said sorry.' "Shona Leigh Caley's mother

And so the Melbourne Victory juggernaut keeps rolling along. Impervious. Imperious. As we head towards the climax of a season that will leave more questions than answers, the Victory have once again comfortably drawn the biggest crowds (average 25,626), and will end up making the most money. Excellence brings its own rewards.Sydney FC may be making some encouraging moves, but it's the Victory who continue to set the benchmark. They're a bigger business, and a better business, than some AFL clubs in town. With a market value of around $30 million, the Victory are proof that if the right people make the right decisions at the right time, running an A-League club can be made to work. In the wake of the salary cap scandal that has engulfed Perth Glory, the contrast could hardly be more pronounced.It may be that the Victory, with perhaps some help from the Sky Blues, will end up putting an exclamation mark on a season that has tapered off dramatically since the Asian Cup. A grand final at ANZ Stadium between the two traditional heavyweights would certainly lighten the mood of those who fret about the A-League's viability, although the four other finalists would undoubtedly disagree.The top six, of course, has now been decided thanks to Football Federation Australia's heavy sanctions on the Glory, but the minor premiership hasn't. The Victory are in pole position with a game in hand over the Sky Blues and a vastly superior goal difference, and few would begrudge them a third Premier's Plate.For a club of their size, six years without a trophy is a lifetime. Neutrals have admired  the football they've produced (they've scored more goals than anyone else) but they've struggled to handle the pressure – never more so than against the Jets last Friday. The nerves have been especially surprising given Kevin Muscat was one of the best big-game players we've ever produced.For all that, the Victory remain well on course for a third championship, and a first title for Muscat as coach. The former Socceroos firebrand was groomed for the role well before he stopped playing, which again underlines the benefit of taking a long-term approach. Some might argue that the Victory can afford to ride the peaks and troughs better than most, but stability often brings success – eventually. Could impatience have been a factor in the Glory's creative accounting? Perhaps.Success for the Victory this season – of all seasons – would be a timely reminder to the other owners who are agitating to change the world without changing themselves. In theory, Victory chairman Anthony de Pietro represents the clubs in discussions with the FFA. In practice, he's finding himself more isolated among his peers because he prefers a more measured view. My advice to de Pietro? Don't change.In the NSL era, there was a moment in time when Marconi Stallions could have pushed themselves to a level way beyond their rivals.They didn't. Tony Labbozzetta, their chairman, would often say he had to compromise his ambitions in order to protect the weaker clubs. Look where that got the Stallions, and the NSL. There's a warning there.Of course, for economic, geographic, and demographic reasons, some clubs simply can't measure up to the Victory. But that doesn't mean the Victory should lower their standards to bridge the gap. The best thing for the A-League is if the other clubs raise theirs.
Big deal: Captain-in-waiting Henderson is likely to sign by season's endJordan Henderson is ready to commit his long-term future to Liverpool by signing a new £100,000-a-week deal.Sunday Mirror Sport understands the deadlock over a new contract for the man set to succeed Steven Gerrard as the Kop captain has been broken in the last few days.Midfielder Henderson, who has just over a year left on his current deal, turned down an £80,000-a-week offer as he wanted a package that reflected his growing influence at the club.It now seems likely he will seal the four-year deal by the end of the season.It is a major boost for boss Brendan Rodgers, who is still reeling from Raheem Sterling’s refusal to accept a new contract also worth £100,000 a week - and the 20-year-old’s TV interview suggesting his decision was based on ambition.Liverpool are reluctant to increase their offer – especially as they are likely to take a financial hit on £16million misfit Mario Balotelli.Roberto Mancini, who worked with the Italian striker at Inter Milan and Manchester City, is back in charge at Inter and ready to offer Balotelli another lifeline.Mancini will be given funds but Inter want the 24-year-old on loan - given Liverpool’s failed gamble.
Hot wheels: Hamilton still topped qualifying despite the uncomfortable glitchLewis Hamilton is used to being in an Formula 1 hot-seat but on Saturday it left him with a toasted backside, writes Byron Young in ShanghaiA leaking pipe or possibly an earthed wire turned the temperature sky high under world champion Hamilton's highly-sculpted, £5,000 moulded Kevlar seat and had him pleading on the team radio for a solution.“It was so hot it feels like my bum had a whooping [beating],” said Hamilton.The source of the rocketing temperature had Mercedes’ expensively assembled team of engineers scratching their heads late into the night here at the Chinese Grand Prix.But Hamilton insisted even the extreme heat would not prevent him becoming champion.“If you win, you can take anything,” added the Englishman.Champion: Lewis Hamilton on the podium after winning the F1 world title last year“Sometimes you have heat coming into the car and your ankles get warm and sometimes the tubes from the radiators and the wires in the cockpit start getting warm.“This time, I have also changed the seat which had less insulation and it was getting kind of warm. It doesn't burn through the overalls, but it gets pretty hot."Top of the pile: Hamilton on pole after Chinese Grand Prix qualifying, ahead of Nico Rosberg and Sebastien VettelNot as hot as it is getting in team-mate Nico Rosberg's cockpit as Hamilton topped qualifying for the third race in succession.The frustrated German missed out on pole by just 4/100ths of a second.
Struggles: Bony has found it hard to reach top form since move from SwanseaWilfried Bony has written off this season – and promised Manchester City fans they’ll see the real deal next term, writes Steve Bates in the Sunday People.The Ivory Coast striker has endured a frustrating spell since his £28million January move from Swansea with Africa Cup of Nations duty and injury hampering his bid to hit the ground running.The 26-year-old striker misses Sunday’s Manchester derby at Old Trafford with ankle and knee injuries – but he’s vowed to be firing on all cylinders next season.“Yes it’s been very frustrating, first because of injury and second because we are not winning games,” he said.“No one expects you to be 100 per cent in the first few weeks. I’m working very hard to get it back.Goal: Bony has scored 10 times in the league this season - but nine were for Swansea"It’s not coming as I would have expected and it’s not 100 per cent yet but I hope to get quicker and score more.“I still want to do something this season but next season I will be very good.”Bony revealed that fellow countryman Yaya Toure played a role in his move to Manchester City.“He told me it would be the perfect club for me,” he said. “He said there was a lot of competition among the strikers but he told me he knew what I could do.”

Gwyneth and Chris: Fortune split down the middleGwyneth Paltrow and husband Chris Martin are to split their £200million fortune straight down the middle.The A-list couple, who are to divorce a year after revealing they were “consciously uncoupling”, will also share custody of their children Apple, 10, and Moses, nine.Gwyneth, 42, will remain in the family home in the LA suburb of Brentwood.Chris, 38, will live in a beachside mansion in Malibu – just four miles away.The Coldplay frontman will spend most of his time in the States so he can be close to his children.Friends say the couple, who wed in 2003, are determined not to fall out over money.A source said: “They’re worth pretty much the same amount so are planning to halve ­everything."They have too much dignity to row about who has what, who should have the most money and who should see most of the kids.“From the moment they decided to go their separate ways, they decided they would not allow the world to see them fight over money."Now they are both moving on with their lives, they see no need to complicate things – they are just keeping it nice and simple.”Gwyneth is dating Glee producer Brad Falchuk, 44, and the pair were recently seen together at Robert Downey Jnr’s 50th birthday party.The actress lives less than a mile from Brad’s ex-wife, TV producer Suzanne Bukinik, the mother of his two children.Both women use the same local shops and restaurants.Chris has been linked to Hunger Games star Jennifer Lawrence, 24.Spokesmen for Chris and Gwyneth declined to comment.
Holders Paris Saint-Germain lifted the first silverware of the French season with a comprehensive 4-0 win over 10-men Bastia in the League Cup final on Saturday.In a repeat of the 1995 final, a first half brace by Zlatan Ibrahimovic, completed by Edinson Cavani's second half double, kept Ligue 1 leaders PSG in the hunt for an unprecedented quadruple.Laurent Blanc's side face Barcelona in the Champions League quarter final first leg on Wednesday and tackle Auxerre next month in the French Cup final.It took Blanc's men just 21 minutes to find the back of the net after Bastia defender Sebastien Squillaci was harshly sent off for taking Ezequiel Lavezzi down inside the box, with Ibrahimovic converting from the spot.The Swedish forward scored his tenth goal in just five games a few minutes before half-time, controlling Mathieu Peybernes' poor headed clearance before lashing a shot inside the bottom corner.Cavani added a third with a superb header, finding himself at the end of Serge Aurier's cross.The Uruguay striker grabbed his 20th goal of the season and put the final nail in the Corsican side's coffin in injury time thanks to a brilliantly-timed pass by Ibrahimovic that sent him through on goal.Against a team currently sitting in 14th, five points above the relegation zone, PSG secured their fifth win in the competition after lifting the trophy in 1995, 1998, 2008 and 2014.With no time for celebrations, PSG will now turn to Barcelona, whom they host at the Parc des Princes on Wednesday.They can then focus on national competition as they top Ligue 1 with seven matches to play and face Auxerre in the final of the French Cup on May 30.
There are few things more exciting for an AFL fan than your team unearthing a hidden gem, but that may be what St Kilda have got in Josh Bruce.Recruited as a defender from Greater Western Sydney in exchange for a draft pick the Giants didn't even use, Bruce played the game of a lifetime on Saturday against Gold Coast.Lining up in the Saints' forward line for the second match running, Bruce tore the Suns apart as he picked up a career-best six goals in the 28-point win at Metricon Stadium.The long-haired 22-year-old had only kicked nine goals in his past 25 games but kicked four alone in the second term as the Saints ran rampant over the Suns.Bruce's majors were highlighted by strong contested marks on Suns' defenders Rory Thompson, Steven May and Sam Day while he threw in a couple of left-footed checkside goals as well.In total Bruce snared eight marks - six contested - and even used some clever hands to feed Jack Sinclair for the youngster's first AFL goal.The hope now is Bruce will be able to help lift the burden on Saints captain Nick Riewoldt in the forward line.Riewoldt's lone hand for the Saints in recent times is highlighted by Bruce's haul being the most goals by a St Kilda player other than the skipper since Stephen Milne's eight goals in round 18, 2011."I didn't even notice during the game," Bruce told AAP."They just kept kind of falling my way. It was just one of those days."Hopefully I can keep giving a good contest week-in, week-out and hopefully take a few more."After being largely frustrated by his defensive role at the Giants, Bruce says he's determined to make his move forward a permanent one."I probably feel more comfortable forward," he said."Obviously I can give a good contest down back but I feel I can naturally feel my game up forward."It's a work in progress but making good steps."
Whether interim head coach Tony Walmsley is calling the shots from the bench or not next A-League season, he is planning for Central Coast to punch above their weight as risk-takers and entertainers.Walmsley had his second win as Mariners coach when they defeated Western Sydney Wanderers 1-0 on Saturday night.A second-minute goal from Josh Rose proved the difference in an open and entertaining match that was the final home game for retiring foundation player John Hutchinson and striker Matt Simon.It was the sixth match since Walmsley, the long-time Central Coast youth mentor, switched from technical director to head coach after the sacking of Phil Moss.There is mounting speculation Walmsley will stay on next season and he did rule out the possibility."I'm enjoying it thoroughly at the moment," Walmsley said."I think as technical director, it's allowed me to get a first-hand look at the players and to actually live and breathe the first steps of a proactive and entertaining playing style, and it's really enjoyable."I'm in this for the players and to see the results of their efforts."And to see them rewarded and feel good ... when I came in they weren't feeling too good about themselves. So that's the bit I'm most pleased with."He said he would gain great satisfaction in doing the job or recruiting the right person but believed it was vital for the new coach to foster an exciting style of play."We're in the entertainment business and we have to really, as a Mariners club, the smallest club in the league, play with an expansive, risky, adventurous playing style," he said."There's a lot more sophistication to be had. It's a very rudimentary work in progress at the moment, but there's really good signs."Despite two minor premierships, one major title and four grand final appearances across 10 seasons, the club has traditionally struggled financially.Walmsley quipped when asked about the Perth Glory salary cap penalty that: "I'm pretty sure the Mariners are not breaking any salary cap rules".But despite the financial restrictions in recruitment, Walmsley believes the Mariners need to take risks with what they have to wow fans and he was encouraged by the display against Wanderers which came after a 6-1 loss to Brisbane. "There was almost an expectation that, 'Hang on, we've just been beaten 6-1, I wonder if we are going to take a more cautious approach for the next game?" he said."That's not the way we are going to play football anymore. We're going to put a peg in the ground and, home and way, big teams, small teams, marquee players or whatever, we're going to be going for it."The players have an appetite for that. They want to do that. They need to be shown how, there's more sophistication required, but that's the fun bit."The Mariners play Wellington away on Friday then finish the season on the road against Melbourne Victory.
The  Lions survived a stoppage-time scare to defeat the harks 23-21 Saturday and secure a Super Rugby top-six place for the first time this season.After building a nine-point lead early in the second half of the ninth-round clash, the Johannesburg Lions looked set for a South African derby victory before being rattled by a late Sharks comeback.Substitute prop Thomas du Toit barged over for a try two minutes from time which fly-half Fred Zeilinga converted, leaving just two points between the sides before a 38,000 Ellis Park crowd.And the visitors from Durban had a chance to snatch victory after the full-time hooter sounded when awarded a 57-metre penalty close to the touchline.Zeilinga, deputising for injured Springbok Patrick Lambie, had the distance but not the accuracy with his kick sailing to the right of the post.It would have been cruel blow had the Lions lost as they dominated the second half, starving the Sharks of possession.But poor goal-kicking by fly-half Elton Jantjies, who succeeded with only three of seven shots prevented the hosts building a commanding lead.Substitute back Howard Mnisi, scrum-half Faf de Klerk and centre Harold Vorster scored a try each for the Lions, who trailed 14-11 after a frenetic opening half.Like Jantjies, Zeilinga had a mixed evening when it came to kicking at goal, missing all three penalty attempts.Victory lifted the Lions four places to sixth, the last play-off spot.It was the fifth win in six outings for the Johannesburg outfit, who were considered likely whipping boys when the season began two months ago.Sharks picked up a losing bonus point and remained eighth on the combined standings.LIONS 23 (Faf de Klerk, Howard Mnisi, Harold Vorster tries Elton Jantjies con 2 pens) bt SHARKS 21 (Renaldo Bothma, Thomas du Toit, Lwazi Mvovo tries Fred Zeilinga 3 cons) at Ellis Park. Referee: Stuart Berry. Crowd: 37,184.
A group of six Greenpeace activists, including an Australian, protesting on a rig travelling to the Arctic have spent their first night in cold conditions.Six Greenpeace activists, including an Australian, have spent their first night on a Shell oil rig in the Pacific Ocean.The group climbed on board the 38,000-tonne Polar Pioneer platform, 1200km northwest of Hawaii, on Tuesday morning.The Polar Pioneer is being transported on a vessel called Blue Marlin.The protesters have a website and are regularly using Twitter to promote their campaign against drilling for oil in the Arctic.The group plans to stay on the rig "for the long haul," one of the group, New Zealander Johno Smith, told NZME via satellite phone.He said the group were enduring cold weather but were coping well.Australian Zoe Lennox, 21, on Tuesday tweeted she was "safe and secure" on the rig.The other activists are from Germany, the US, Sweden and Austria.They travelled to the platform on the Greenpeace ship Esperanza and have supplies to camp for several days, sleeping in hammocks.They're hoping to highlight Shell's plans to drill for oil in the Arctic in less than 100 days.Shell confirmed on Tuesday that the protesters had boarded the platform."[They're] jeopardising not only the safety of the crew on board, but the protesters themselves," United States spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh said.Ms op de Weegh said Shell had met with organisations and individuals who oppose energy exploration offshore Alaska."We respect their views and value the dialogue."We will not, however, condone the illegal tactics employed by Greenpeace. Nor will we allow these stunts to distract from preparations under way to execute a safe and responsible exploration program."
Cadbury has given the V sign to fans of its most popular teatime treat.It has quietly cut its traditional pack of 24 chocolate fingers to just 22.And the price has gone UP despite it being two digits short and 11 grams lighter.The move will further anger Cadbury lovers infuriated when Creme Eggs packs were cut from six to five earlier this year.Chocs away: Cadbury's Creme Eggs have been cut from six to fiveFavourite choc bars such as Mars, Cadbury Dairy Milk, Snickers and Yorkie have already been downsized, with makers insisting shoppers prefer smaller products to higher prices. But the practice has been blasted by consumer watchdogs.Burton’s, the firm that makes Cadbury’s biscuit products, says stores have been asked to reduce the recommended price of the new 114g chocolate fingers.But research by mySupermarket shows the old 125g pack, worth £45million a year in sales, cost around £1.19 last year while the 114g one sells at an average £1.43.It cost £1.50 at Sainsbury’s. Cadbury has also sliced two chunks from its Dairy Milk bar and reduced sweets in Roses tins.No illusion: Nestle have cut Black Magic from 376g to 348gThe Sunday Mirror also discovered other downsizing. Burton’s has reduced its Cadbury Collection biscuits from 380g to 335g while Fabulously Fox’s biscuits shrank from 650g to 600g. Nestle cut Black Magic from 376g to 348g while Terry’s Chocolate Segsations dropped 330g to 300g.A Burton’s spokeswoman confirmed the fingers pack weight reduction but would not say how many fingers each box contained. She claimed they were cheaper than ever.Richard Lloyd of consumer group Which? said: “Shrinking products can be a sneaky way of putting up costs for consumers because pack sizes shrink but the prices don’t. It’s now time for action on dodgy pricing practices.”

Finding happiness: Aimee West, fiancee of Lee Rigby, who has struck up a close bond with a cadet majorThe fiancée of murdered soldier Lee Rigby has struck up a close bond with a cadet major 27 years her senior.Aimee West, 24, has found happiness with father-of-three Major Paul Draper, 51, a friend of Drummer Rigby, who attended his funeral.Aimee was devastated in 2013 when Lee was hacked to death in the street outside his army barracks in Woolwich, south-east London.But in recent months she and Major Draper have been on several dates.“I like to see Aimee” he said. “We are very good friends and we enjoy each other’s company.”A source said: “If anyone deserves to be happy, it’s Aimee. She’s had a dreadful time. She’ll never forget Lee – he was so important to her, but everyone wants her to be happy.“Paul is a lot older than Aimee but he’s been there for her since Lee died.”Major Draper – a well respected and decorated member of the Middlesex and North West Army Cadet Force – parted from his long-term partner last November.He was previously married to the mother of his three children.He and former Royal Military Policewoman Aimee, who have known each other for a number of years, then struck up a close friendship.Our source said: “They’ve been to a number of functions together held by the cadets, and it’s common knowledge they’re dating.”Tributes: A boy lays a floral tribute at the scene of fusilier Lee Rigby's murder on the first anniversary of his death on May 22Aimee is planning to run the London ­Marathon later this month in honour of Lee and the armed forces charity SSAFA.In a posting on JustGiving called Remembering Lee Rigby, Aimee writes: “So after raising so much money last year for the SSAFA’s Lee Rigby fund I thought I’d give it another go but on home soil.”So far, more than £25,000 has been donated by well-wishers.In an interview in November last year Aimee spoke movingly about life without Lee, who was just 25 when he died.Widow: Lee Rigby's ex-wife Rebecca attended the unveiling of a memorial in Middleton in MarchShe said: “Lee’s just there all the time. I talk to him all the time. He was so crazy, so outgoing. As soon as he turned up, everyone knew he was there because he was energetic and fast-paced, and like nobody else I ever met. He was just so alive.”Aimee, a staff sergeant with 19 Company of the ACF, met Lee in August 2012 at an army cadet training camp in Sennybridge, South Wales.Lee, who had been married and had a two-year-old son Jack, was attached to a cadet unit led by Major Draper’s ex-partner.Over the following months, Lee and Aimee fell in love, and he proposed.In May 2013, Aimee was coming to the end of a three-month deployment in Camp Bastion in Afghanistan and was looking forward to planning their wedding. But her desperate attempts to contact Lee in Manchester for a scheduled chat were in vain.Father: Lee Rigby, with son Jack, had three childrenRadicalised killers Michael Adebolajo , 29, and Michael Adebowale, 22, had mown him down in the street before hacking him to death in broad daylight outside his army barracks.Armed with a meat cleaver and a gun, they targeted Lee because he was wearing a Help For Heroes hoodie.They claimed their heinous act was revenge for the killing of Muslims by British armed forces.Both were found guilty of murder and given life sentences.Killer: Michael Adebolajo clutching a knife in a bloodied hand following the murder of RigbyIn an interview last year, Aimee said: “All I can think about is the time me and Lee were together. I’ve got to keep his memory alive and I need to focus on making sure I don’t spiral out of control.”She added: “I remain devastated by his death but he totally won my heart, so he will always be part of me.”Last month Major Draper comforted Aimee when she attended a service at St Paul’s Cathedral to honour fallen soldiers in Afghanistan.A source said: “Aimee still struggles with the loss of Lee, and when she went to the service for Afghanistan she found it twice as hard – she lost friends during the war.“But Paul has been there to help her through. They’re really close.”
Eating behind the wheel, shaving, applying makeup, doing the crossword -- even tooting a trumpet.Bad as distracted driving once was in Canada, it was tame old-school stuff compared to the gadgets competing now for drivers' attention and, increasingly, killing them and others.Now, think texting a short novella to your BFF.Think yakking on your smartphone, updating your Facebook status or playing air guitar as you shuffle your iPod for tunes.It's so bad many police forces routinely stake out busy intersections to pick off the scofflaws red-handed.Little wonder frustrated police are pleading for a return to old-fashioned common sense and safety on the roads.Why? Because the safe-driving, hands-free messages just aren't taking.Too many drivers cast blind eyes -- or ones fixed to mini-screens -- to the dangers of piloting vehicles that can weigh close to two tonnes and rocket along at speeds of 100 km/h or more, covering vast distances in mere seconds.A scourge greased by the digital revolution with its explosion of attention-demanding devices, distracted driving was already a problem when provinces and states started writing it into their traffic law books years ago.Ontario, for one, had one of North America's toughest laws against distracted driving when it debuted in 2009, banning use of hand-held devices while driving and underlining that with fines ranging as high as $500.That was then; this is now.Distracted driving has since become the No. 1 killer on Ontario roads, its deaths expected to eclipse those from yesteryear's top killer, impaired driving, for the seventh straight year in 2015. So dramatic has the sea change been, annual crackdowns on distracted driving now loom as large as the roadside sobriety checks of old.Ontario is not the only place scrambling to keep up. It's trying to stiffen its distracted driving law with proposed legislation that would jack maximum fines up to $1,000 and slap offenders with three demerit points.The grim statistics on Ontario Provincial Police-patrolled roads speak for themselves, says OPP Sgt. Peter Leon."In 2013 we investigated 78 road fatalities related to distracted driving," he says. "That surpasses the 57 alcohol-caused deaths and 44 for driving at excess speeds, so it is now the No. 1 cause of death on our roads."In the first four years Ontario's law was on the books, from 2010 through 2013, nearly 251,000 charges were laid. That's the equivalent of a major city of drivers thumbing their noses at laws meant to protect both them and others."There is absolutely no reason for this and the resultant injuries and very preventable deaths," says Leon.So, what will it take for drivers to sit up and pay attention?Already, many driving schools focus more on distracted driving as the digital generation slips behind the wheel."We used to spend maybe three or four minutes on the subject," says Jean-Claude Madore, an instructor at the Ontario Driving School in London, Ont. "Now, it's a whole segment of our teaching program."Among the films the school shows students drivers "is a very compelling film of a 19-year-old Londoner who died doing this while driving," Madore says."Ten years ago we weren't that concerned with the smartphone, but now it seems everyone -- young and old -- is guilty."But is the intended audience listening, or just twiddling its texting thumbs?There are the hospital emergency room cases to attest to the bane, along with higher insurance premiums for the convicted."If you are convicted of a violation that involves anything from going through a stop sign to using a handheld device, it will be reflected on the premiums you pay," warns Pete Karageorgos of the Insurance Bureau of Canada.The industry group, on Twitter, has taken to the safety slogan, "Drive Now.

"That's a big concern for us and should be for everyone."Leon's question is obvious: Why are so many drivers compelled to read inconsequential Twitter posts or to chit-chat online?"Not every message is that important and it's just not safe to split your attention in two or three ways," he says,But if tough laws, stern warnings, ghastly crash figures and costly fines aren't doing the trick, maybe it's time to up the ante by yanking offenders' licences or forcing them to qualify to drive all over again.Maybe then, we'll all get home in one piece.
Health officials say that more than 100 people in southeastern Indiana have tested positive for HIV, an expansion of an outbreak that caused the state to declare a health emergency last month.Health officials had said they expected the number of HIV cases in Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Ky., to rise ever since they discovered the problem. The spread of the virus, which causes AIDS, has been linked to the use of contaminated syringes and the painkiller Opana in the area.Almost all of the confirmed HIV cases have been from Austin, a rural city of about 4,200 people.“The fact that we now have more than 100 cases of HIV related to this outbreak speaks to the urgent need to raise awareness about injection drug use and its connection to HIV,” State Health Commissioner Jerome Adams said in a statement.The state declared an emergency after health officials reported more than 70 HIV-positive tests since December, far more than the five cases typically found in Scott County each year. There have now been 106 HIV-positive tests related to the outbreak, including 95 confirmed and 11 preliminary cases.Republican Gov. Mike Pence authorized a short-term needle exchange to fight the spread of HIV last month, an exception to the state’s conservative anti-drug policy barring programs that trade dirty needles for clean ones.The needle-exchange program, which is only for Scott County residents, gives out enough needles for one week based on reported drug use.A total of 437 syringes were turned in and 1,151 syringes were distributed by Thursday afternoon, the state’s health department said.The state also established a public awareness program to provide information on safe sex and needle disposal, as well as a hotline to sign up for HIV testing and treatment.For more national news, follow me on Twitter: @ParviniParlance
A security guard has been involved in a physical altercation at a Sydney shopping centre after asking a man and his six friends to leave the premises, police say.Police were called to Dixon Street in Haymarket just before 5pm on Saturday following reports of two men being injured.It is understood a security guard outside a shopping centre asked a man and his six friends to leave.A physical altercation followed which resulted in both men being injured.The 37-year-old security guard was treated by paramedics for cuts and bruising to his head.Meanwhile, a 21-year-old was arrested and taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital and also treated for a cut to his head and bruising.Police are trying to establish if the security guard was attacked by more than one person and why the guard asked the men to leave the shopping centre.Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
As he prepares to bid farewell to his loyal audience later this year, the face of RTHK's long-running City Forum has a word of advice for all the officials who have refused to join in the debate."You cannot force dissidents into the corner and leave them with nothing," Joseph Tse Chi-fung told the Sunday Morning Post. "You've got to listen and give them a chance - even if they break the rules."The veteran journalist, who has hosted and produced the public affairs programme for 12 years, has been "asked to retire" in October, when he turns 60. He had hoped to stay on at the public broadcaster.Tse said he had always taken a tolerant approach to the show, filmed live every Sunday in Victoria Park and which celebrates its 35th anniversary today.He was referring to the 30 or so regular members of the forum's rowdy park audience, ageing Beijing loyalists known as "Victoria Park uncles".Tse said the "uncles" were always given a chance to vent their spleens - usually heckling pro-democracy speakers and airing their patriotic views - during the hour-long show. They only got kicked out if they broke the rules, for example, by swearing, or if they did something like brandish a weapon, but even then they would only be banished for a short time, he said."These uncles are my people. I must protect their freedom of speech. In fact, the forum is like a microcosm of society. And I think the government should welcome a diversity of voices," Tse said.The show invites politicians, academics and public figures to discuss current issues, and the audience can take part in a Q&A session.But, much to his disappointment, Tse said far fewer officials had taken the microphone at the forum since the 1997 handover. He said Leung Chun-ying's administration seldom sent officials to the debate - whether the topic was constitutional reform or public finance.Tse made a point of this in 2012, when he placed an empty chair on the stage to mock Secretary for Education Eddie Ng Hak-kim after he declined Tse's invitation to join the discussion on whether patriotic classes should be made compulsory in schools.It was a move said to have annoyed broadcasting director Roy Tang Yun-kwong, a government administrative officer without media experience who took the helm at RTHK in 2011. The appointment was criticised by staff and he has faced accusations of political interference.Ahead of the forum's anniversary broadcast today, Tse acknowledged that the absence of younger faces in his regular audience was a worry.In 2010 the "uncles" were joined by a group of young "Victoria Park brothers", who breathed new life into the forum with their pro-democracy ideas and sharp wit. But it was short-lived, and by the next year they were nowhere to be seen."It was indeed unfortunate," Tse said with a sigh. "They came because they were discontented with the unjust political and economic systems. But they soon realised they could change nothing and left, disappointed."For Tse, there is another worry - his looming retirement. He said he had not expected the station's decision. Tse was not hired as a civil servant and thought RTHK's strict policy of requiring civil servant staff to retire at 60 would not apply to him.He was told in December that his contract would last only 10 months and he would have to retire at 60. "I thought I could have stayed on, like other veterans who are in their 70s or even 80s. I didn't realise. But I can't say whether this decision is right or wrong," he said."I've been in journalism all my life. If I have to leave, I will look for a job in journalism. But I won't retire," he said.
In festering cages, chickens being reared for food are forced to scrabble over the rotting flesh of other birds.These are the shocking scenes inside a squalid poultry farm which supplied meat to high street restaurants and shops.A Sunday Mirror investigation can lay bare the cruelty that was business as usual for Paul Flatman, the owner of Hawkshill Farm.The birds were so tightly packed together that many of them had died from heat stroke.As well as the horrific scenes inside, the disturbing images also show a mound of dead birds piled three-feet high in the yard.Inspectors found conditions so horrendous they could not establish an exact toll of dead birds – but estimated nearly 7,000 littered the farm at the time of their visit.For those still alive, feeding plates were covered in faeces while many were found pecking the rotting remains beneath their feet.The pictures came to light after a sickened ex-employee reported Flatman, handing over this haul of damning evidence.Describing conditions on the farm in Great Leighs, Essex, the whistleblower said: “It was horrendous. These chickens were living in their own faeces and he didn’t care.“We would tell him it was inhumane but he would just say, ‘If you don’t like it, find something else.’“I had a mortgage and bills to pay. There was no way out.”Inspectors from Essex Trading Standards visited the farm in 2012 after a tip-off. They said the “scale of putrefaction” made it impossible to count the dead birds.Flatman, 65, later admitted six animal welfare offences at Colchester magistrates court. He is due for sentence next month after the case was delayed by legal wrangling.His firm, Paul Flatman Ltd, went into administration in May 2013 with 40 staff being laid off.The business had supplied halal meat to shops and restaurants across the UK, including Birmingham, Gainsborough and London.It processed between 80,000 and 90,000 birds every week. The firm reported a £10million turnover in 2012, but a pre-tax loss of £82,000.Elisa Allen, of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said: “Although sickening, the conditions are simply another level of hell for the gentle birds condemned to a life of suffering on poultry farms.“We can only hope the judge throws the book at him.”Steve Lynch, service manager at Essex County Council Trading Standards, said: “Consumers are entitled to expect the meat they buy has been humanely treated.“The discovery of nearly 7,000 dead chickens due to heat stroke in overcrowded conditions, some in a putrefied state, is a serious breach of animal welfare legislation.”Last year, Flatman paid £190,000 for Colchester’s “Jumbo” water tower, saying he hoped to build a restaurant on the top.
A blacksmith got a shock - when a client asked him to craft some Fifty Shades of Grey-style S&M torture equipment.The kinky request was a new one for the Adam Blockley, who makes 17th century armour."I didn't ask too many questions, to be honest," laughs the father-of-two, whose chain-mail business crafting is fast proving a global success.More orthodox orders come flooding in from Australia and the Netherlands, reports the Birmingham Mail.Adam recently celebrated scooping a lucrative order for pikes, breastplates and helmets from the soon-to-be-opened Civil War Centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire.He came up with the cast-iron business plan after being made redundant from his engineering job.A dedicated member of civil war re-enactment society Sealed Knot, Adam thought it was the ideal way of combining business with pleasure."I was doing it as a hobby," he explains, "making a few bits and pieces for friends."I've got a background in fine art, sculpture and blacksmithing, so it wasn't a total leap in the dark."He even hammered out a sword and helmet for 40-year-old wife Jocasta, who is also in Sealed Knot.Adam began work in a shed at the bottom of the garden, but now uses a workshop close to the site of the Battle of Edgehill.Now his work is much sought after by historical societies with more and more orders coming from abroad."On the continent you had the Thirty Years War, which took place around the same time as our civil war," says Adam."I use the same techniques as the 17th century armourers, and do a lot of research to get things right, even down to leaving hammer marks on munitions-grade breastplates."It is time-consuming, but I want to get things right."In the summer, when the forge is busy, it's hot; in the winter it gets chilly."But it's a rewarding job and something I'm passionate about."Ninety per cent of orders come from fellow re-enactors who need custom-sized gear.It's a long, painstaking process, with a pikeman's helmet taking two days to shape out of mild steel.Adam uses an original crimping technique to join the two halves.A breastplate can take 20 hours and cost around £400.He adds: "During the civil war such metal was reserved for the higher status soldiery, with the rank and file using softer iron."Paradoxically, the latter proved better at absorbing the impact of musket balls when used for breastplates – an early version of a bullet-proof vest."The civil war centre, set to open on May 3, is dedicated to the conflict which raged from 1638 to 1653, and has been boosted by a £3.5 million Heritage Lottery grant.
Former Ming Pao chief editor Kevin Lau Chun-to called for greater dialogue between young and old to mend the deepening rift in a society that is "more chaotic and difficult than before".Lau, who was seriously injured in a knife attack last year, was speaking at the Jesuit Education Forum held at his old school, Wah Yan College, in Wan Chai yesterday.He said the challenge for educators was how to equip the young generation with the values and skills they needed today."The world used to be more simple … [it] has since become a lot harder to explain … and much more chaotic and complicated," he said. "We need to go in, immerse ourselves in their world, to understand them."Lau recalled his own youth in the 1980s, when he said the world was more stable compared with today. "The China and Hong Kong a 40-year-old teacher knows is very different from the China and Hong Kong a 15-year-old student knows," he said.He added that dialogue between the generations was the only way to address serious divisions in society.Young people were at the forefront of the 79-day pro-democracy protests last year, and the city is also grappling with social issues including tensions with mainland visitors, a housing shortage and a huge wealth gap."The challenge for educators today is not just holding on to tradition, but how to instil in young people the maturity, relevant values and skills to deal with a more difficult world," Lau said.He told the audience to tolerate dissent: "If young people can agree to disagree, there is hope."Lau added that young people should not be so fast to delete friends from their Facebook accounts just because they disagreed with them.He also referred to his time as a student at the school, where he said he learned about tolerance, acceptance and equality."Thirty-four years ago, I had real experience of democracy when I ran for vice-chairman of the student association of Wah Yan. All students from Form Three or above can vote," he said, adding that he won the election.Former education secretary and Wah Yan student Michael Suen Ming-yeung also spoke, along with Father Jose Mesa, from the Society of Jesus, and Chris Lowney, an author, Jesuit and a former JP Morgan managing director.
The Tories are planning to axe the Navy’s flagship helicopter carrier as part of severe cost-cutting measures.The disclosure comes days after Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed a Labour government could not be trusted to fund the military properly and replace the Trident nuclear submarines.But senior defence sources say the Tories have listed HMS Ocean – the Navy’s amphibious assault ship and helicopter carrier – to be withdrawn from service in 2019.Details of the plan have emerged just a year after the Queen attended ­celebrations to rededicate HMS Ocean after a £65million refit at Devonport dockyard in Plymouth.The decommissioning of the ­helicopter carrier will leave the Navy and Royal Marines with just one operational assault ship because a second vessel has been mothballed.Experts say the cuts will hit Britain’s ability to mount assaults from the sea.A Navy official said: “No decision has been taken with respect to the future of HMS Ocean.”But a document placed in the House of Commons library says: “HMS Ocean will remain in service until 2019. There are no current plans to replace her.”Sources also claim David Cameron’s Tories have drawn up plans to sell 55 RAF Eurofighter Typhoons.The sale comes as the RAF are so short of aircraft they were forced to urge Mr Cameron to delay the retirement of the Tornados now attacking Islamic State in Iraq.An MoD spokesman said the aircraft were being replaced one-for-one with newer aircraft.The size of the Army has also been slashed by 20,000 and it now has just 82,560 trained soldiers.Labour’s Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said: “The Tories’ desperate attempt to smear Labour with lies can’t hide the fact that they are making severe cuts to our defence capability.“When Michael Fallon says there will be no further cuts to our Armed Forces nobody will believe a word he says.”Last month experts said the Forces face more cuts no matter which party is in power.The Royal United Services Institute suggested it was inevitable defence spending would fall below the Nato target of 2% of GDP.
The government should come up with a more comprehensive youth policy and diversify the economy to help young people spread their wings, says the head of the Council of Social Service.Chua Hoi-wai, chief executive of the council, said there was a lack of overall planning and leadership on youth policy. He did, however, acknowledge that Financial Secretary John Tsang Chun-wah had announced measures to address housing problems and encourage start-ups in his recent budget.Chua was addressing teenage members of the Boys' Brigade at Polytechnic University in Hung Hom yesterday.The council is a non-governmental organisation that acts as a bridge between social service NGOs and the government."The Commission on Youth is under the Home Affairs Bureau. But a lot of resources go to education and welfare authorities. It is yet another department which oversees economic development … Hong Kong does not have a comprehensive youth development strategy," he said.The teenagers told Chua about the challenges they faced in pursuing their goals. One of them said Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying's policy address in January had focused too much on housing and had ignored other issues facing the young.In response, Chua said the government was doing more to help young people, but the problem was that initiatives were often carried out by different departments working independently of the others, with no overall direction."I hope the Commission on Youth can come up with a strategy which gives some overall direction [on youth policy]," he said.Chua added that, in the long run, the city should branch out beyond finance and tourism to give youngsters some alternatives.He said the West Kowloon Cultural District could provide opportunities, and noted that the city's rapidly ageing population meant there would be huge demand for elderly and nursing services in the future.
The nation's top celebrity chefs have rallied behind Dame Alison Holst after it was revealed the "Godmother of New Zealand food" has been diagnosed with dementia.The much-loved chef, 77, has hung up her apron for the final time, prompting the outpouring of praise from chefs.Award-winning chef Michael van de Elzen, who grew up on Holst recipes, said while the end of a career is a major loss, her recipes will live on in kitchens.A well-used 30-year-old copy of an Alison Holst cookbook sits on his mother's bookshelf.His mother's cooking centred around Dutch recipes from her childhood so, if she needed to bake something Kiwi, she would turn to Holst."When she was asked to make a sponge cake she'd go straight to the Alison Holst cookbook.Holst's retirement is an end of an era for cooking, he said."She is the godmother of New Zealand food."Television cooking shows are now about drama, tears and arguments.For Holst, the food was the most important component of cooking shows."We've lost the beauty of someone demonstrating their cooking in front of you."MasterChef judge Simon Gault said Holst was not just a good cook, but also a warm and likeable person.His mother also used to copy her recipes and he was sure they would live on in his household."She's an iconic chef and it's very sad news. "She can rest assured her recipes will live on for years to come."Holst signed off as a food columnist in her community Orewa paper last month after memory problems became too much.The Holst family have asked for privacy at this time.Simon Holst has written 27 best-selling books with his mother and the pair have built a successful cooking and kitchenware brand.Her daughter, Dr Kirsten Holsten, is a senior clinician specialising in helping Alzheimer's patients in Manawatu.Holst lives in Orewa with her husband.

She is famous for her everyday recipes which appeal to both children and parents.In 1987 Holst was made a CBE for Services to Home Science.The Holst family have encouraged people to support the work of Alzheimer's Society and Age Concern.
Wang Jieming, 39, has a flair for connecting people and things. In university, where he read Swedish, he founded a student-run news agency; upon graduation, he used his language skills to produce concerts and became the Chinese agent for sports stars. The Zhejiang native has worked as a correspondent in Sweden for China's top official news agency and also ran a magazine-reading app in a start-up. He is now working on his own venture.Why did you learn Swedish?It was a once-every-four-year programme organised by Xinhua and the Beijing Foreign Studies University. They wanted 14 secondary students to learn Swedish at the university and work for the news agency's outpost in Sweden upon graduation. It was a special way of entering university because I didn't have to take the national higher education exam.Was the language hard to pick up?It was very tough. There weren't Chinese-Swedish dictionaries, so we had to use English-Swedish ones. At the time, there were no exchange programmes, so we all had to rely on the sole Swedish teacher who was sent here to teach us.When did you go to Sweden?I began to work with the Swedish government not long after, when their foreign office invited me to be a producer for a huge concert in Beijing's Workers Stadium. It was to mark the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Sweden. It was quite a big gig for a 23-year-old to produce, and after several more shows, their government was so impressed that they invited me to Sweden to learn about their arts and culture. Interestingly, it was in Sweden that I met the lawyer of the legendary table tennis player Jan-Ove Waldner and I later became his agent in China.Was the work there tough?I spent some years working as an editor with Xinhua. Then I was in Sweden between 2003 and 2005. You may think there shouldn't be a lot to report on in Sweden, but in fact the job took up most of my time there.What was it like living there?It was a life-changing experience, mostly because of how the country is run. Swedes think very highly of their social system, and they think their system - which emphasises fairness, freedom and innovation - is second to none. I was really struck by the wide use of technology in people's everyday lives. I had my driving licence renewed, among other paperwork, using a computer. That was very different from how people did things in China.What did you do after you returned to China?I applied for a transfer to a magazine affiliated with the news agency. Then I went into business development for the magazine. After some time, I returned to Xinhua to help it develop its new media. Meanwhile, a friend had a business idea that involved projecting interactive adverts onto billboards or buildings, and we did it together while I kept my day job. Things were looking up until the head of the Beijing airport was arrested for corruption and every project he approved had to be terminated.What did you do next?A friend and I set up this online community of freelance translators to rate and rank different translation agencies, whose treatment of translators was very exploitative. It became China's biggest translator community, with more than 40,000 people registered. So we set up a platform that allowed agencies to put out jobs that translators could bid for. It went well and won us some awards in entrepreneurship contests.So you kept your job at Xinhua all this time?Yes. In fact I did pretty well and climbed the ranks up to the level of a division head, comparable to the head of a county government. But in 2010, after 13 years at Xinhua, I resigned and joined a start-up that was making a magazine-reading app. The app is now the top in its field in China and has been downloaded by more than 100 million people. However, I've since quit the start-up to focus on my own venture.What is so special about the app?It is going to roll out a new feature that provides content to service-based apps that do not offer any content. For instance, many people use taxi-hailing apps these days, but we start up the app only when we need a car and when we pay. The time in between can be used to provide users with content, such as magazine or news articles. The content is customisable depending on the nature of the app's business. The scheme would allow the magazine app to sell more adverts.I've been enthralled by smart technology lately. Smart wristbands have been very popular with the tech-savvy but they have yet to become mainstream. I've been busy making smart jewellery that ladies would find pretty. I've been working with an Italian jewellery group who'll be responsible for the design. The product won't see the light of day for another six months or so, but many investors have already shown interest.
It is important to note the name of this show, one word in particular: "presents". As in Paul Kelly presents not Paul Kelly and friends or just Paul Kelly. While, bar some neatly chosen covers, the songs performed were written by Kelly – alone or with various combinations of most of the musicians and singers on stage – the night, like the album from which it sprang, was really about everyone else but Kelly.Like the recently retired-to-the-great-pavilion Richie Benaud (a comparison the cricket-loving Kelly would appreciate), the main man left space for the talent around him to be seen, heard and celebrated while he made telling interjections to focus minds again. It was his work but their show and that generosity lifted everyone.This applied not only to the singers, about whom more soon, but to his unshowy, not particularly famous outside muso circles, yet sans pareil band. Mr Bill McDonald and Gentleman Pete Luscombe are a rhythm section who always have power but never abuse it, who swing and groove but never resort to easy cliche. Keyboardist Cameron Bruce is as adept with the churcified as he is with the bar-ified (not a word? It is now.) and never looks to overplay. And guitarist Ashley Naylor can be choppy, funky, snaky, prominent and subtle, and while he lacks the reaching-for-heaven hair of the absent Dan Kelly, he has charms of his own.They could punch in freshness to Sweet Guy and Dumb Things, shake in their metaphorical gospel robes for Hasn't It Rained, slowly put the torch to Where Were You When I Needed You and much of the time make you think you were if not in the Apollo Theatre, then certainly a room where soul was served warm and lightly perspiring.Up front of these fellows, and doing much more than merely fronting, the stalwart Vika and Linda were marvellous, whether pushing hard in the brassy What You Want, going girl group doo wop on Down On The Jetty or just taking you to chapel, their class is almost a byword now.Less known to the room, but bringing some of the Bull versatility was the PVC-adorned Clairy Browne, who didn't show her full power range but still won newcomers over with the suggestion of a growl under that coffee tone, and the fresh promise of Kira Puru whose voice seems crafted for sad soul songs.Oh yes, there was a chap there too who I'm told is not only awfully good looking, sex on legs and a fair old guitar player but can sing both big and small, heart and hips, rhythm and blues and smoked a duet with Browne on When Something Is Wrong With My Baby. This is all true but I don't see the need to publicise such an unfair allocation of qualities beyond confirming his name is Dan Sultan.Yes, not all of us have the generosity of spirit of Paul Kelly. Or the songs. Or the talented friends. But we did get to share in it.
President Obama delivers remarks during the first plenary session of the Summit of the Americas in Panama City on Saturday. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)President Obama and President Raúl Castro symbolically ended more than a half-century of official estrangement between the United States and Cuba here Saturday in a historic-face-to-face meeting that Obama said put them on “a path toward the future.”In a small room with two chairs side by side, Castro smiled as Obama said that they would relay their concerns about each other’s policies but could disagree with a spirit of respect.“Over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries,” Obama said. He said their immediate task is to reopen embassies in Havana and Washington.After the two shook hands, Castro, speaking in Spanish, said he agreed with everything Obama had said.“We are willing to discuss everything, but we need to be patient, very patient,” Castro said before reporters were ushered from the room. “We might disagree on something today on which we could agree tomorrow.”The meeting, on the sidelines of the 35-nation Summit of the Americas being held here, lasted roughly an hour, and the two leaders did not set a date for the reestablishment of diplomatic relations or the reopening of embassies in their respective capitals. In a sign of the difficulty for the two countries in making basic, concrete progress toward overcoming their longstanding enmity, Cuba’s foreign minister, Bruno Rodriguez, said the two countries would meet again for talks “as soon as possible,” but were still working to achieve the “appropriate context” for formal ties.Despite his offer to discuss “any issue,” Castro also told Obama that his government would not accept U.S. efforts to “bring about changes in the political and economic system in our country,” according to Rodriguez.Their meeting followed a dramatic speech to the gathering in which Castro called Obama “an honest man . . . a humble man,” who is not to blame for what he said was more than a century of U.S. oppression of Cuba and is “courageously” trying to persuade Congress to lift its embargo against his country.Speaking for nearly an hour, Castro first pounded the table and recounted the history of what he called U.S. oppression and abuse of Cuba, from early military incursions and occupation to the Bay of Pigs invasion and what he described as U.S.-sponsored terrorist attacks on the island., etc.“I apologize to Obama for expressing myself so emotionally,” Castro said. “President Obama has no responsibility for this. There were 10 presidents before him; all have a debt to us, but not President Obama . . . I have read his books — parts of them — and I admire his life.” As he spoke, Obama sat without expression, his eyes downcast.The two leaders announced in December that they would normalize relations and that they intend to reestablish formal diplomatic ties. The opening of embassies in Washington and Havana has awaited the U.S. removal of Cuba from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that Obama is preparing to make in the coming days, if not at the summit itself.Before the highly anticipated bilateral meeting, each of the 35 hemispheric leaders at the summit first delivered formal speeches in the public plenary session.In his speech, Castro angrily denied Cuban participation in international terrorism, saying that although his country had supported other revolutions, its experience with terrorism came primarily from what he called U.S.-sponsored terrorist attacks inside Cuba in decades past.Obama spoke immediately before Castro. He told the gathering that he had committed the United States to a “new approach” to the region when he attended his first Americas summit in 2009. “I met that commitment,” including the decision to restore ties with Cuba, he said.Just before Obama’s speech, Ecuador’s leftist President Rafael Correa, an ally of Cuba, railed against the embargo and recounted what he said were the sins of U.S. multinational companies in his country. He demanded the return of U.S.-occupied Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and spoke of “North America and our America.”Obama, in what appeared to be extemporaneous remarks that were not part of his prepared speech, addressed Correa by name, saying he was “not interested in theoretical arguments.” The Cold War, he said, “has been over for a long time, and I’m not interested in having battles that, frankly, started before I was born. What I’m interested in is solving problems and working with you . . . in the spirit of alliance.”“I always enjoy the history lessons that I receive when I am here,” Obama said evenly. “I’m the first to admit . . . there are dark chapters in our history. . . . We can, I suppose, spend a lot of time talking about past grievances. And I suppose that it’s possible to use the United States as an excuse . . . for political problems that may be occurring domestically” in Latin America. “But that’s not going to bring progress.”Instead, he said, he would rather talk about climate change, economic growth and security.Debates about the past, Obama said, in a clear jab at Correa’s economic and political difficulties at home, are “not going to solve the problems of children who can’t read, who don’t have enough to eat. . . . I just want to make very clear that when the United States speaks out on human rights, it’s not because we think we’re perfect, but because we think the idea of not killing people because they disagree with us is the ideal.”Speeches from heads of state were theoretically limited to eight minutes, but Castro, who was making his first appearance at the summit, held every three years since 1994, asked for some indulgence.“Since I was excluded for the past six summits,” because of U.S. insistence, “I ask you to excuse me if I go a few minutes more,” he said, indicating he would speak for “six times eight minutes.” He ended 50 minutes later, saying that Cuba, “a small country with few natural resources, has lived under hostility” and that his lengthy remarks were of historical importance.Later Saturday, after Obama had left the room, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro began an equally lengthy speech. After denouncing U.S. sanctions imposed on officials in his government, as well as a U.S. declaration that Venezuela is a “national security threat” to the United States, Maduro said he, too, respected Obama, “in spite of the fact that he has threatened our motherland.”Maduro, too, spoke emotionally, shouting parts of his speech and rejecting Obama’s call for a forward-looking vision in the region unburdened by old grievances. “We talk about our history so much because we’re proud of it,” he said. “We don’t have a dark past that we regret because we’ve killed people in other countries and dropped bombs on them.”The Venezuelan leader seemed to have planned his remarks thinking Obama would be present while he delivered them, which left Maduro calling for “dialogue” and extending an open hand to the U.S. president’s empty chair.Maduro said he wanted to believe Obama’s statements in favor of better relations “but didn’t trust” the U.S. president.“If you want, we’ll talk, but if you don’t want to talk, that will be your legacy with Venezuela,” he said.Maduro said he would give U.S. diplomats the 11 million signatures he was planning to hand Obama, collected by his government in opposition to the U.S. sanctions.At one point in the speech, Maduro, a former guitar player in a rock band, voiced his admiration of Jimi Hendrix and Eric Clapton as evidence that he is not “anti-American.” Clapton is British.The U.S. and Cuba will soon agree to reopen their embassies. Here’s what happens next.After 23 years, the U.S. is dropping its claim that Cuba sponsors terrorism. Here’s what it means.
He made hugely flawed decisions on monumental issues. But I don’t have to agree with what he did, does or says to recognise his strengths. As a leader he had, and has, immense cap­ability and clarity of thought. His party would benefit from some now.His decision to hold a referendum on Scottish devolution in 1997 was controversial and opposed by many who thought it was back-sliding on a commitment. But he ended up unifying the country and brought the SNP and Labour together on the side of progress. It was a good moment. A very good moment. And a signal of what the SNP and Labour in combination could achieve.Last week, as I contemplated the often risible Labour election campaign of the moment, I wondered how much difference his talents would make. Thinking about the controversy around the renewal of the Trident nuclear weapons system, I dipped back into his memoirs to remind myself of what he has to say about the issue. It is instructive.In 2007 he admitted to hesitancy over the decision. “I could clearly see the force of common sense and practical argument against Trident, yet in the final analysis I thought giving it up too big a downgrading of our status as a nation… and too big a risk for our defence.”He was riven with doubt. “The contrary decision would not have been stupid. The expense is huge, and utility in a post-Cold War world is less in terms of deterrence, and nonexistent in terms of military use… It is true that it is inconceivable we would use [it] alone, without the US.”Remember he was speaking in 2007 before the financial crisis and colossal resulting pressures on the public finances. If the decision was 50:50 for him then, where would it have been in the context of grating, punishing austerity?By 2009, senior retired military leaders Field Marshal Lord Bramall and generals Lord Ramsbotham and Sir Hugh Beach went further than Blair and denounced Trident nuclear weapons as “irrelevant”. They argued they were neither a deterrent nor independent and, instead of renewal, funding should be focused on equipping our forces to cope with the actual challenges they faced. Blair would have nodded in some agreement, no doubt.What is a monumental decision of importance requires deep financial consideration – the full cost is estimated at £100 billion. It requires complex strategic military thought and a clear sense of purpose around what Britain’s modern role in the world is. In the context of the election debate, though, it is reduced by the Conservatives to a cheap measure of political and jingoistic manhood.Labour remains riven just as Tony Blair was. Jim Murphy argued in the STV leaders debate that he wanted a world free of nuclear weapons but that we needed to renew Trident and negotiate with all the other holders of weapons. I get the point but it seemed deeply disingenuous. Is the commitment to multilateral disarmament real or lip service? Are any summits planned? How could £100bn on a new system help rather than be seen as proliferation?Murphy’s former Cabinet colleague (Lord) Des Browne would appear to agree.He argued in 2013 that “[Updating Trident with a like-for-like replacement]… will demonstrate to the international community that we intend to keep nuclear weapons on permanent deployment for decades while seeking to deny those weapons to everyone else. In the process, it will destroy any chance of building the broad-based international support required for a stronger non-proliferation and nuclear security regime” .A recent survey of Labour candidates in the election found that three in four opposed renewing Trident. That sounds realistic to me.But were it not for the strong voice of the SNP would this issue even be a live one in the election?Opposing renewal is not a margin-al, eccentric or radical position. It is acutely reasonable given the realities of the world military, diplomatic and financial.It appears to boil down to a very high price to buy Britain a status that speaks to the nation it once was rather than a modern vision of what it could be.If the debate is reduced to election-eering jingoism we take decisions of inter-generational and international importance on the basis of crude, simple-minded cynicism.We shouldn’t have to wait for mem-oirs to hear the truth. Regardless of your view, it demonstrates a major benefit of the SNP voice in this election and, as many progressives across the rest of the UK appear to hope – in the parliament that follows. «
The former Dragon was one of 100 high-profile high-flyers, who signed a letter warning of the threat that a Labour victory would pose to Britain’s economy.Bannatyne warned that a Labour government would “threaten jobs and deter investment”.Within a few days he was on Twitter praising Ed Miliband’s “courage” in coming up with a proposal to scrap non-domiciled tax status saying it would get his vote.His remarks reinforce the adage that a week is a long time in politics. One wonders if a week is just as long in business. When faced with such a mixed message from a budding entrepreneur in the “Den”, one suspects Bannatyne would have wasted little time in saying: “I’m out”.Teed up for further golf talesTHE Dream Shall Never Die sees Alex Salmond bore for an independent Scotland on the subject of his golf game. Having broken 90 a couple of times during the referendum campaign, Salmond appears to be close to developing a Seve Ballesteros complex (or at least becoming a clubhouse bore).Given his preoccupation with the game, perhaps readers could send him their favourite golfing tales. After all, the reading public would be delighted to buy a book containing accounts from high-handicappers about the time they holed a 30 footer to save bogey after coming to grief in the gorse bushes at Nairn.HE may now be a best-selling author, but one suspects Alex Salmond may be missing the political high life.While his successor Nicola Sturgeon was “starring” with the other Scottish political leaders in STV and BBC debates last week, Salmond was far away from the television studios.Indeed while Sturgeon was appearing in the BBC debate in Edinburgh, Salmond (the Scottish National Party candidate for Gordon) was taking part in a local hustings event in Inverurie Town Hall.GREAT news for the Rupert Murdoch publishers William Collins, who produced Alex Salmond’s referendum memoir The Dream Will Never Die.Salmond has announced that there is going to be a paperback and a revised edition of the bombastic classic, which devotes much space to diatribes against the BBC and the “metropolitan, mainstream media” – simply because they sometimes chose to challenge his views and assertions on Scottish independence.The former first minister’s plans for the book were announced in an interview he did to get down with the social media kids on the Commonspace website.“There is going to be a paperback and a revised edition.“Because it is topping the bestsellers list across the UK for two weeks running. I would like the metropolitan media to explain that one,” the former first minister said, with just a hint of smug, self-satisfaction.
Geoff Ellis, of DF Concerts, claims the biggest stage show in Scotland, which boosts the economy by £15 million, might never happen again if planners side with those opposed to the proposed new site at Strath­allan Castle in Perthshire.Despite tickets for the 21st T in the Park being sold out, the three-day concert is still awaiting planning approval from Perth and Kinross Council. Public consultation on the plans ends on 24 April and councillors will debate the app­lication at a meeting still to be arranged for next month.Ellis, who was challenged about concerns raised by the Woodland Trust, insisted Strathallan was the “right venue” to take over from Balado.Asked on BBC Radio’s Good Morning Scotland programme yesterday whether the festival would continue if it did not take place at Strathallan, he said: “I don’t think there is a venue, without going very far north in Scotland, which would be viable for T in the Park; so yes, I don’t think it would carry on if we didn’t host it at Strathallan this year. Scotland needs T in the Park.”After the programme, he told Scotland on Sunday: “The point I was making was that by the logic of the Woodlands Trust, if T in the Park can’t work at Strathallan then how could it work anywhere in rural Scotland?”There have been issues about an osprey nest at the site, but organisers stress they have a good working relationship with the RSPB in anattempt to deal with that.However, Charles Dundas, of the Woodland Trust Scotland, said “irreplaceable” ancient woodland could be lost if the festival goes ahead at Strathallan, adding that festival organisers had not done enough to satisfy them that nature would be protected.But Ellis said: “We’re in the middle of a live planning process and when the final location of the osprey becomes clear, we will work with the relevant organisations on the development of our plans to agree an appropriate buffer zone and manage it accordingly.“Aside from this, our planning application and environmental statement answers all questions posed by the statutory consultees and we remain confident that we can ensure the long-term protection of wildlife as well as the future of the event of Strathallan.”The organisers announced in 2012 that the event would have to leave Balado due to its proximity to a pipeline.Last year they said the preferred option was Strathallan Castle. The discovery of ospreys on the site meant that the criteria changed and DFC submitted a planning application and an environmental statement.A spokeswoman for Ellis later added: “The Woodlands Trust had the wrong classification of the woods, claimed that we might harm wildlife, such as badgers, that don’t live on the site, and referenced trees that have not been present at Strathallan Estate for almost 40 years.“If we were to accept their logic, no festival should take ever take place near old woodlands – which would effectively rule out outdoor events taking place anywhere in the countryside.“We’re confident that we can not only deliver T in the Park but that our aspiration is to safeguard the site’s environment for the long-term,” said the spokeswoman.
In the final weeks before the general election, party leaders are pulling out all the stops to attract voters - but not everyone is impressed.On Wednesday, a six-year-old Boulton schoolgirl made headlines when she was seen plopping her head down on her book in apparent boredom as David Cameron tried to read with her.And the Prime Minister isn't the only politician guilty of causing kids to cringe; Ed Miliband, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg have all been pictured sharing awkward moments with youngsters.In 2011, Labour leader Ed Miliband was pictured visiting a school, where he sat down on a pink sofa to chat with some young schoolgirls.But rather than engage with the children, Ed was snapped awkwardly sipping tea from his cup as the girls watched him and rolled their eyes.Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls likely had the best intentions when he sat down to play make-believe with a primary school youngster and her doll.But the girl couldn't hide her boredom in a picture from the meeting, resting her chin in her hand as she looked wearily away from him.It seems the unrelenting enthusiasm of politicians is what annoys kids most.Indeed, one little boy in a photo from a school visit appeared desperate for a nap as George Osborne leaned over him, smiling brightly at the other pupils.And Nick Clegg didn't quite fit when he sat down at a table of school kids, who uniformly went about their business as he looked around at them, apparently trying to make friends.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown didn't have much luck either when he got down on all fours to talk to a baby.The Scot looked like more of a looming giant than a friendly face, his dark business suit contrasting with the rainbow carpet and toys on the floor.William Hague has been met with incredulity by children on multiple occasions.In one particularly funny photo, he is seen awkwardly looking over the shoulder of a student as her friend rolls her eyes, seemingly annoyed at his presence.In another, a boy looks downtrodden as the Leader of the House of Commons apparently scrutinises his drawing of a fox.
Josh Warrington beat Dennis Tubieron in an official eliminator for the WBC featherweight title in Leeds.Warrington increased his unbeaten record to 21 fights with a unanimous points victory, the judges awarding him the bout 119-109, 119-110, 119-109.A bout against champion Gary Russell Jr still looks a way off but a domestic fight with Lee Selby is a possibility."I've got plenty more to bring," Warrington, 24, told Sky Sports at the First Direct Arena.Wales' Lee Selby, soon to fight for the IBF featherweight title, was ringside and Warrington suggested the pair could sell out Leeds United's Elland Road."I wish him all the best and I hope he gets the world title," added the dental technician."But me and him would fill out a stadium if me and him could get it on, so that is the one I'm after."Selby added: "I think I'm well ahead of him but he is improving with every fight. It won't be long before I will be fighting him in front of this fantastic crowd."Warrington, already a European, Commonwealth and British featherweight champion, also landed the WBC 'international' featherweight title with Saturday's victory.Earlier, Essex's Martin J Ward picked up the vacant WBC international super featherweight title with a fifth-round stoppage against Maxi Hughes.Yorkshire's Hughes retired on his stool during the re-match in Leeds, following a draw between the pair in December.
The governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Akwa Ibom State, Mr Udom Emmanuel, says the call for the cancelation of elections in the state is a defeatist approach that does not reflect the true state of things.In a telephone interview with Channels Television on Saturday after the elections in the state, Mr Udom said the election process was peaceful.He said that the call for cancelation based on claims of violence in the state should not be welcomed, as the pockets of issues were not enough for cancelation of the election results.“In Akwa Ibom, we have a very large number of voters. I am not saying that there were no pockets of issues here and there, but it is not the way it is being analysed at all.“People came out. They were orderly. The voting was good and peaceful.“We have gotten reports from the 31 local government areas of this state.“Apart from those pockets of people getting anxious here and there. Immediately they started accreditation, everywhere went peaceful,” he said.Mr Emmanuel further expressed surprise that people could call for the cancelation in Akwa Ibom.“People are calling for cancellation and writing that there are crises in Akwa Ibom. Things are not the way it is being reported.“We don’t like this defeatist approach with people running to the studio to start crying foul.“We had a very peaceful election. Things are not the way people are reporting it. People should wait for the result to be announced,” the PDP governorship candidate stressed.
In a land prone to schism and where diverse peoples exhibit fissiparous tendencies and propensity for going after each other’s jugular, words are capable of fanning conflagration. It can particularly be more volatile when there are high political stakes polarized along primordial clannish ties. It is worse when a clan among several others in the multiethnic community fears a loss of grip on its ancestral lands, heritage, commerce, wealth and political hegemony; and that it is conceding too much to another clan considered foreign. At this point, all can be thrown to maintain relevance, and caution can be hurled away, while strategic deterrence or offence becomes the instrument of inter-group relations. This is when altercations, threats, death wishes or the curse of drowning in lagoons can come from any quarters, even from sacred places as the palace of His Royal Majesty.The royal dimension to the ongoing 2015 elections reared its controversial head last week when the highly respected paramount ruler of Lagos, King Riliwan Akiolu took it to the wires while hosting an Igbo interest group, a platform he employed to issue a stern warning (call it threat) to the Igbo community to vote for the choice of the paramount ruler and “owner” of Lagos State failing, which would naturally result in perilous times in the Lagoon. It is historical as well as institutional that the Oba of Lagos is the head and father of all, and that he is the “landlord extraordinaire” while all the inhabitants- indigenes, non-indigenes, traders, fishermen, farmers, teachers, adults, children, men, women, foreigners from other African nations or outside Africa, et cetera- are his subjects and by extension, “tenants”. Even the Europeans acknowledged this when they dealt with Oba Kosoko and Oba Akintoye in the second half of the nineteenth century, precisely from 1851 up to the colonization of Lagos in 1861.The Oba was a very powerful man and in the context of British colonial rule, the Oba was regarded as an important and indispensable middleman in reaching to the people of Lagos. Lagos has retained its heritage, customs and traditions so much that it is in the consciousness of any newly crowned king that he is the father and lord of all the peoples in the domain. Incidentally, Lagos, like Benin and Abeokuta, despite the early contact with the Europeans, has not let go of its ancestral roots, the Oba is the “alese ekeji orisa” (second in command to god) and his words are taken with utmost seriousness, just as his rites, rituals and festivals, such as the internationally famous ‘Eyo’ are regarded as untouchable and undeletable. The other Obas in Lagos, including the Akran of Badagry, monarchs of Ikeja, Ikorodu and Ajah, among others, regard the Oba of Lagos or Eleko of Eko as the supreme head.But in Yorubaland, the king is not quick to talk and is subdued in temper. This is for two basic reasons: he is the father of all, which makes him the last court of appeal (call it Supreme Court as in pre-colonial days); and he is the repository of deep, deep wisdom. Elders and cabinet members are not expected to react spontaneously (in fact, elders in Yorubaland are regarded as wise men that provide solution in every delicate situation). The king is therefore the primus inter pares in knowledge, tact and wisdom. The very reason therefore why Obas spend longer years on the throne is not just because it is customary; but the fact that their exhibition of maturity and high level native intelligence and wisdom makes it customary to stay longer or forever in power.It is however also expected of Obas to defend their domain. Any Oba who loses his domain to any internal or external force is not worthy of the throne. Kings in native Africa are war generals who lead platoons or entire battalions to battles to defend the territorial integrity of their domain. When kings or war generals lose battles or make their domain vulnerable, they are condemned to die or go on exile. This was the fate of Are Ona Kakanfo Afonja, whose defeat in a war of Oyo Empire’s territorial expansion led to his self exile and establishment of Ilorin kingdom. Even at that, he lost Ilorin again to the wily Fulani pastoralists under Alimi, which ended the Yoruba control of Ilorin and its provinces. Shaka, king of the Zulu people in Southern Africa would do anything, including use of full military weight or cunning tactics to keep the Europeans at bay in protection of his people and lands. Shaka personally led his wars and won all, warding off immediate neighbours and western imperialists. In pre-colonial Benin, particularly in 1897, Oba Overamwen Nogbaisi and his chiefs in the course of restricting any British visit and subsequent incursion, went on eliminating all the British party led by their English colonial officer. The backlash was horrendous, but the objective had been achieved.Lagos in the post-colonial times cannot however, be the African society of the pre-colonial or colonial times. A lot has changed and constitutionally, the “owner” of Lagos now are the people and the custodian of their rights, the elected governor. Kings have now taken the traditional position of reminders of cultural heritages and leaders of thought, with or without whom progress can still be recorded. However, in the consciousness of African monarchs of the present, the “divine right of kings” still persists and they still are, no doubt, powerful influences and voices in the system. They could still be agents of stabilization and their touch and firm control of the grassroots can be a huge advantage for any politician seeking elective posts.Oba Akiolu’s direct threat to the Igbos was perhaps coming against the background that the Igbos were evidently dominant and taking over the economic, social and political spaces of the metropolis. The National Assembly elections, in which the “Ndigbo” massively voted for the party considered opposition in a largely APC-dominated state and the emergence of some Igbo politicians from Lagos as House of Representatives members-elect, were probably the fears that the Oba was losing his domain to external forces. Constitutionally, Lagos, like any other states, belongs to all and there should therefore be no fuss or fear about which clan is dominant. But there is also the angst that Lagos, in a Yoruba enclave, has been conceding so much to their brothers from Eastern Nigeria all in the belief that it is a “No Man’s Land”. But the Oba would not agree with this because even at coronation and with all he is told by oral historians and custodians of palace customs, he is the “lord” and “owner” of Lagos and as such, a fighter for the protection of all that his forebears had left behind to protect. The threat to the Igbo, to do his will of voting his homeboy, Ambode of the APC or face the dire consequences of drowning in the Lagos Lagoon, was thus coming from the attachment to the past, that the king’s will must be done and that any king who loses political and economic control to strangers has lost the moral authority over the domain.But why is Lagos a No Man’s Land? Since colonial times, when it became the political headquarters after Calabar, Kaduna and Lokoja, Lagos has transformed into a cosmopolitan city and its being the Federal Capital at independence for decades made it an all-comers’ stronghold. But geographically, it is still situated in Yorubaland, a domain of the Eleko, with traditions, customs and history embraced and celebrated by all. The cosmopolitan nature of mega cities around the world has not necessarily made them to lose their socio-cultural identity.But in retaining such identity, there are modest and appealing ways of communicating to other clans, without drawing ethnic blood. The great Eleko should have addressed the issue more appealingly and yet authoritatively.
The Queensland Reds sank to the bottom of the overall Super Rugby standings after a 43-22 loss to the Bulls in South Africa on Sunday morning.Continuing their forgettable season, the struggling Reds could only hold on for so long at Pretoria's Loftus Versfeld before they were inevitably dealt their sixth consecutive defeat.It was about as encouraging as a 21-point failure could possibly be under the circumstances.Richard Graham's troops battled manfully without some key names and refused to lie down but ultimately lacked the firepower to make their second half comeback count.Following the Blues' first win of the season over the Brumbies on Friday, Queensland are now officially the worst team in the competition, two points adrift of their nearest rivals Western Force.With chief playmaker Quade Cooper back on the sidelines with injury and livewire James O'Connor struggling with a calf issue, Queensland's attack lacked cutting edge.Particularly in the first half, they had significant stretches of possession but were unable to breach a disciplined Bulls defence.Goalkicker Lachie Turner also struggled to find his range at altitude, hitting just one from four attempts.Warm favourites heading into the match, the Bulls - who rested Springboks trio Jan Serfontein, Handre Pollard and Adriaan Strauss - established a 10-0 lead after an early penalty and a breakaway try to Francois Hougaard that started deep in their own half.The Reds responded just after the quarter hour with a clever chip-and-chase from makeshift flyhalf Nick Frisby opening up Turner for a run through on the right.But the Bulls crossed twice more in short order - first through Pierre Spies, then again through Hougaard - to establish a comfortable 24-5 halftime lead.It would have been easy for Queensland to lie down at that point but Will Genia's try five minutes into the second stanza at least gave them a spark.The France-bound halfback came away with the ball from an attacking scrum and somehow crawled his way to touch down under the posts, setting up Turner for an easy conversion.Genia provided the kick for a Frisby five-pointer almost immediately afterwards to reduce the margin to 24-17.But the Bulls were able to weather the storm, withstand another Queensland try through Mario Kotze - who finished off a brilliant run from the bustling Samu Kerevi - and close out the game with relative ease.BULLS 43 (Francois Hougaard 2, Burger Odendaal, Pierre Spies, Marcel van der Merwe, Piet van Zyl tries Jacques-Louis Potgieter 3, Tian Schoeman 2 cons Potgieter pen) bt QUEENSLAND REDS 22 (Nick Frisby, Will Genia, Marco Kotze, Lachie Turner tries Turner con) at Loftus Versfeld.

Former banker, Adesunmbo Ajaba Adeoye, is married to Senior Pastor, Royalty Christian Centre, David Adeoye. Sunmbo who runs Esob Events is the initiator of Esob Heroes and Inspiring Change. She tells Adetutu Audu she is fulfilled helping others to discover their potential.ADESUNMBO Ajaba Adeoye is an amazing and passionate entrepreneur whose devotion to entrepreneurship and excellence has brought her to the up-tables with other successful entrepreneurs in the events management industry in Nigeria. She runs Esob Events, an event management company, and, over the years, she has successfully carved a niche and built a name for herself in the industry.Her desire to help people explore their potential to the fullest birthed the initiative, Esob Heroes, which she founded as a platform to push her passion.  It was this quest to inspire many more that became the catalyst that initiated the birthing of the “Inspiring Change with Adesunmbo Adeoye” initiative, focusing on educating the girl-child and bringing to fore a consciousness on entrepreneurship as the way forward, setting up free conferences that will inspire every woman to take the initiative in fulfilling their dreams.This philanthropic foundation held its first conference in 2014 in celebration of the International Women’s Day and highlights of the day was the presentation of Esob Heroes awards to outstanding women in business. In May same year, Esob Heroes took a deliberate step further to enhance the knowledge of children in public schools by donating free books and other educative materials to over 3000 school children.This year’s, themed “MAKE IT HAPPEN”, featured skill acquisition training, aimed at empowering women, with the presentation of work tools (in different categories) like grinding machines, standing hair dryers, sewing machines among others to the less-privileged women in business as part of 2015 International Women’s Day celebration. Other notable women who graced and inspired other women at the event included Pastor Nomthi Odukoya of Fountain of Life Church who was the special guest; On-air-personality, Toke Makinwa; popular fashion designer, Nkechi Harry Ugonadi of NHN; and Wazobia FM’s On-air personality, Omotunde Adebowale-David (LOLO1).The former banker explained that Esob heroes is a vision borne out of her ceaseless desires to support entrepreneurial ideas through capacity building, mentorship and free conferences, seminars and trainings. This determination to help others discover the treasure they carry on the inside, she revealed, was what propelled her, after she was awarded a scholarship by Goldman sachs, to study entrepreneurial management at EDC Pan Atlantic University under the Lagos Business School umbrella in 2011.‘Having completed the course, I realised the need to deliberately educate and enhance the knowledge of women around me and afar off, in my own little way of ensuring that more women ruled in the entrepreneurial frontier. So far, we have been able to help many women with great ideas and passion seek meaningful and fulfilling careers by organising meetings where we collaborate with like minds and help each other connect with other leading entrepreneurs to achieve far-reaching goals together,’ she noted.Adeoye added that the privilege to inspire change came last year January, when a call came through from a representative of the EDC, requesting to know if she would embrace the challenge. ‘And since I have been recommended by EDC Pan Atlantic University to host women and influence them to inspire change, I agreed to it and today I’m grateful I didn’t resist,’ she said excitedly.‘I remember being nervous when I was recommended to host women on International Women’s Day. The anxiety alone brought sleepless nights. I didn’t doubt the amazing power of God, so I gave it a shot and indeed it was a huge success. Looking at my life’s journey, the pain, reproach and struggle led me into God’s amazing grace. I am so thankful I embraced God and didn’t let go of His grip,’ she revealed.The amazing lady added that in such a short time, she is blessed and lifted beyond words. ‘I want to thank God for giving me the voice, the platform and the grace to inspire change,’ she said.For her, it is a daily vision and she feels fulfilled in helping others accomplish every bit of their God-given potential. ‘My uttermost desires are that they succeed and pay forward what they have received as benefactors of the inspiring change movement,’ she pointed out.Now that she is married to a pastor, how is life as one? Adeoye disclosed that life as a pastor’s wife is an endearing one, filled with an aura of glory and grace, guided by the principles in the word of God. However, like every leadership role, it comes with few (not so attractive) challenges and responsibilities which help her to wholly trust in God and strengthen her relationship with the Holy Spirit (the master of all knowledge).Despite being an entrepreneur, has she ever thought of returning to her banking job? The Ogbomoso-born passionate entrepreneur was quick to say that ‘moving from a guaranteed 30-day pay slip into the world of uncertainty or indefinite earnings for me was like jumping off a parachute for the first time. It was both frightening and exhilarating. If you have ever done a 9-5 job, you will realise that you are limited in time, resources and remuneration, but an entrepreneur’s income is not limited by routine or calendar days.’She went on: ‘In as much as I enjoyed my years in banking, and appreciate those in that line of career, I have never thought for a second to return because there are so many opportunities in the world of an entrepreneur.’So, who influenced her early in life? Adeoye who also doubles as Royalty Christian Centre music minister said her mother really influenced her. ‘She was and still is an independent super woman, a business mogul who diversified into several lines of businesses, like trading (whole sale/retail), catering/restaurant businesses and a lot more.’What then is her beauty secret? ‘My beauty secret is in my daily walk with God and my inner peace with man. I learn from the scriptures daily to show love to everyone irrespective of colour, race or gender. We are all one before the creator who, despite our sins, died for us. He expects that we will share and show same to the world,’ she gushed.On her personality and style, Sunmbo Adeoye said she is the kind of woman one will describe as the “happy go lucky”. ‘I like decent and dignifying outfits,’ enthused the pastor’s wife.
IN a new action thriller that mirrors fear and exploitation of a people by their government and expertrates, a cast of veteran actors like Olu Jacob, Richard Mofe-Damijo and Taiwo Ajai-Lycett bring the verve of thematic film to bear.Titled Oloibiri, the film, which is revisiting the subject of militancy in Niger Delta Nigeria, explores the pitiable condition of a people whose natural resources constitutes an irony.Although the movie is centered on a government’s pacification of a long-abused people, it addresses this theme through three subject matters: the tragic journey of Oloibiri into developmental retrogression, the socio-cultural under-runs that birth militancy and the governmental intervention to compensate a land, which arguably has been raped of its resources.It will be recalled that the Easter weekend was abuzz with a teaser, an online campaign tagged #GuessTheHand, which was conceptualised by the team at Rightangle Productions Ltd to herald the movie. The campaign requested participants online and onsite Silverbird Galleria and Ozone Cinema in Lagos, as well as Silverbird and Ceddi Plaza in Abuja to guess the hand of a male Nigerian sticking out of an oil well.Interestingly, the campaign got noticeable attention as the clues led some participants to guess correctly – that the hand belongs to Richard Mofe Damijo, who was a supporting actor in the movie.The movie which also stars William R. Moses(CSI, Touched by an Angel), Ivie Okujaye(AMVCA winner) and Ifeanyi Williams, prides itself with a crew that includes, Rogers Ofime; Canadian-based producer/director (Mnet Tinsel, Africa Magic Original films) as the producer, Samantha Iwowo (Bristol, UK) as the scriptwriter and Curtis Graham(GreyHouse Films,USA) as the director. Producers say Oloibiri will première across Nigerian and international cinemas from May 2015.Interestingly, they are also planning to screen the movie at this year’s edition of Cannes Film Festival on the 19th, 21st and 22nd of May.
Two police officers have been injured following the closure of a dance party in Sydney involving approximately 1000 people.Police were called to an abandoned industrial area on McPherson Street, Botany at 10.30pm on Saturday after receiving complaints about the rave.Police had to be assisted by back-up officers as well as the riot and dog squads to shut down the party due to safety concerns.About 1000 people were moved on with relative ease, but it is alleged a number of partygoers began throwing glass bottles at police.One of these bottles struck an officer who suffered cuts to his head. The officer was taken to Prince of Wales Hospital to have pieces of glass removed from his head.Another police officer was allegedly assaulted by a 26-year-old woman, who was taken to Botany Bay Police Station for questioning.Police were forced to use capsicum spray to subdue unruly partygoers. A number of people were treated for minor capsicum spray contamination.Police are investigating the incident and trying to determine if the party was promoted on social media platforms.Do you know more?

A young mum who was crippled after she dived 40 feet off Appley Bridge quarry in Wigan has described how her children inspired her fight back to health.Natalie Prescott, 26, was not expected to survive after she dived into a quarry in a dare-devil stunt which went horribly wrong.Her family was warned she was unlikely to pull through and that if she did, she would almost certainly lose her legs.Through perseverance, she is finally on the way to recovery – and says her children are her inspiration.But after learning that a teenage boy tragically drowned in the same quarry on Friday, Natalie is campaigning to have the area closed off to the public.Mother-of-three Natalie, from Wigan, said: 'This tragedy brought it all back to me. I almost died there too – and I want all young people to learn from my stupidity - please stay away from lakes and rivers because tomb-stoning can kill you.'But in a way, I'm glad it happened to me, because it taught me what's important in life. All that matters to me now are my three lovely children.'The accident, in June 2012, happened at Appley Bridge quarry, Wigan, near the farm owned by Natalie's mother, Susan.Susan was later to see the air ambulance over her farm – unaware it was carrying her own daughter.Natalie, who is mother to Saskia, 7, Harley, 5, and 19 month old Scarlett, says: 'I hooked up with some old friends and on a sunny afternoon we went for a day out to a beauty spot, where rocks overhang a disused quarry.'My mum lived nearby and she was looking after my two children whilst I went out with my friends.'We were daring each other to jump in the water, and even though I knew it was stupid, I went along with it. I had never done anything like that before.'I just fancied doing something crazy. I wasn't thinking about my children, I was thinking about myself.'As Natalie jumped, her nerves got the better of her and she hesitated. She smashed against an overhanging cliff, before hitting the water.She says: 'As I hit the water, I saw a large gaping hole in my knee. I had no pain but I was shaking and in shock.'Natalie's friends dragged her onto the banking and gave her mouth to mouth resuscitation as she began to struggle with her breathing.Unconscious, she was flown to hospital by a mountain rescue team and placed in ICU.Natalie says: 'My mum and my children saw the air ambulance land near their farm, and they watched it – unaware that it was me who was injured.'Her family was at first warned she might not survive – and were then told she would lose both of her legs.Natalie says: 'My memories of those first days in hospital were very hazy.'I was in so much pain and my legs were just a mush. My knee cap was smashed and my ankles were pulverised.'She had several operations during a three month hospital stay, including surgery to fit metal plating in her ankle and an artificial knee joint.Though doctors managed to save her legs, she was left unable to walk or stand.She was transferred to rehab, where she began to learn to walk again.Natalie said: 'It was a very low point for me. I felt so guilty that I had put my family through so much pain and worry.'Every time my children visited me in hospital, they would cry and beg me to come home.'My son, Harley, said to me: 'Get out of that big pram mummy and start walking again.''It was very painful and so frustrating, but I just had to work hard, every day, to get myself well again.'Natalie finally took her first steps one year after the accident.And in August 2013, she gave birth to a new baby, Scarlett.Natalie says: 'Scarlett's birth really inspired me to get back on my feet. I had to get better, because I had a new baby to look after.'I was determined to look after her on my own because I've needed so much help with my older children.'I feel like I'm back to being a mummy again, and that is such a precious role and one I won't take for granted ever again.'I won't ever be back to how I was; I have a limp and I can't walk far. I won't ever be able to ride horses again.'But in a way, I'm grateful for the accident.'It made me grow up and appreciate what is important in life.'When I heard that the young boy had drowned in the same spot it sickened me, and I now I'm going to do everything I can to get the area closed off.'I'm starting a petition because I want people to listen to me before another life is lost.'
Rabat – The magical region of Imilchil is located in the eastern Atlas Mountains; a small region bounded by mountains. In the horizon, you will find a mighty mountain telling an ancient tale. The region’s inhabitants have given each mountain a name bearing historical Amazigh connotations. In the middle of region flows a river with green banks surrounded by agriculture. Besides breeding, agriculture constitutes the population’s main source of revenue.Economically speaking, the region is relatively poor, but rich in terms of culture and tourism. Its abundance in touristic qualifications makes Imishil a destination for many foreignerswho flock there each summer, but also Moroccans obsessed with mountain tourism; constituting a significant but seasonal source of revenue as the number of tourists dramatically decreases during winters.One of the main attractions marking Imilshil a touristic destination par excellence is the myth its mountains tell: a love story ending with the formation of the two lakes ‘Isli’ and ‘Tislit’. The region is also famous for the engagement season organized each year after harvesting.The origin of the word ‘Imilchil’In the northern entrance of the region exists a place called ‘lchil’. According to its inhabitants, it was a place wheat and cereal were weighed and it is from here that the name was coined. The word ‘Imilshil’, in the Amazigh language, it is composed of two words: ‘Imi’ and ‘Shil’; literally, ‘the mouth of the weighing wheat place’. ‘Imi’ or ‘mouth’ in Amazigh is used to refer to a place in front of something, for example, the mouth of a cave. The second part of the word, ‘lshil’ means wheat.Less known than the romances of Romeo and Juliet, Qais and Laila, and Antar and Abla, ‘Imilchil’ is the source of an Amazigh love story. Once upon a time, there was a serious conflict between two of Ait Heddou’s most important tribes: Ait Azza and Ait Ibrahim. Their problem revolved around irrigation and pastures, leading to a radical break between the two tribes. At the height of this conflict, a young man from Ait Ibrahim fell in love with one of the girls of Ait Azza. This was considered an outright defiance against the tribes though all that the two young people aspired was that their love result in a marriage sealing their pure love. But the growing enmity between the two tribes prevented their love, forcing the lovers to flee to neighbouring mountains. They burst into tears lamenting the impossibility of their union; the floods of their tears drowning them into two lakes: Isli and Tislit, forming the great tableau between the mountains. Since that time, the two tribes vigorously celebrate the marriage season, in an attempt to make up for their mistake. This tradition continues and has become known as the engagement season.After summer time in Imilshil, the rhythm of life starts to slow and the winter brings sub-zero temperatures that cover the region with a white gown. An eerie calmness prevails and transforms what was once a crowded village into an abandoned void. The streets are empty and the only movement seems to be chimney smoke coming out from the white houses. The happy tunes of Ahydous songs are replaced by the bleating of sheep and goats struggling to survive.In this period begins the real suffering of the inhabitants of Imilshil and neighboring regions. Roads are closed, power is cut and villages are completely isolated from the world for days. Those who did not prepare well for the cold are likely to suffer as it becomes impossible to reach the weekly market to get the most basic necessities. The sick people either live with their sickness or die and bodies are transported in a coffin on the back of an animal; an animal which plays the role of an ambulance. The sick endure their ailments if they are lucky, but some, won’t make it to the spring. Despite the challenges inherent to Imilchil, life goes on.This article was originally published in Arabic on Morocco World News Arabic and translated by Najah Elyahyaoui.

This was the message from President Jacob Zuma at the opening of the Sefako Magatho Health Sciences University‚ formerly known as the Medical University of South Africa in Ga-Rankuwa today.“You must promote the legacy of Sefako Makgatho by producing qualified‚ highly skilled and patriotic human resources‚” said Zuma.“If you serve the country and you are patriotic‚ you will do a lot. Patriotic South Africans will stand up and do what he or she sees is not being done‚ [rather] than to criticise what is not being done. That’s patriotism.”Minister of Higher Education and Training Blade Nzimande‚ who took the decision to uncouple Medunsa from the University of Limpopo‚ said part of the liberation of the country was about freeing all South Africans from a system that was “fundamentally dehumanising and used education as one of its weapons”.The president said that R298 million rand had been allocated to the university for student subsidies and R210 million for its establishment.The university offers undergraduate courses in the areas of medicine‚ health care sciences‚ oral health care‚ pathology and pre-clinical sciences. It opened its doors in January this year.Sefako Makgatho was a politician‚ educator and journalist. He formed the Transvaal African Teachers Association in 1906‚ one of South Africa’s first education unions‚ and fought for a non-racialised and equal education system.He utilised the courts to challenge legislation that affected and undermined Africans in urban areas‚ particularly those affecting the freedom of movement. He died in 1951 in Riverside‚ Pretoria at the age of 90.

The Chelsea Fringe runs from May 16 until June 7, while the Chelsea Flower Show is underway in London. It started in 2012 and is a new festival for everyone who’s interested in gardens and gardening. The Fringe has an increasing international participation, but, till now, had not found its way to Scotland.However, the National Trust for Scotland’s Drum Castle has joined the gardening ‘avant garde’ and have become the first Scottish venue to be included in the official programme.Drum’s Head Gardener Diana Robertson said: “Chelsea is the world’s most prestigious flower show. The Chelsea Fringe is a way in which communities can celebrate the beauty and art of gardening locally, whilst still being part of the amazing energy of the main festival. We might not be able to travel the 544 miles to Chelsea, but we can still take part and be proud that we are the most Northern and first Scottish venue.”To mark the occasion, Drum is running a Garden Photography competition. The team are looking for shots in three categories: 1) My favourite gardener – (this could include garden ‘helpers’, like hedgehogs who helps keep slugs under control, as well as human subjects), 2) A view of Drum Garden, 3) All that grows – (this is a close-up of a plant, flower, tree or similar).Entries are welcome in three age groups – adults, senior pupils and primary pupils, before May 18. For more details, to register, and terms and conditions, please email drum@nts.org.uk. Please note that entries must be submitted in printed form.The competition entries will be judged by three noted professional photographers and gardeners, including the Trust’s Head of Photographic Images, Marcin Klimek, Head of Gardens, Robert Grant, and Simon Hall, who has his own professional photography business.Being the Head Gardener of the stunning gardens and grounds of Drum Castle, Diana Robertson is hugely knowledgeable and considers the springtime festival as incredibly important. She said:“Spring is a really important time to celebrate gardens. Everything is bursting in to life, and getting out into the gardens, listening to the birds sing for their territory, watching the first bees come back to the hives saturated with cherry and lime blossom, anticipating the beauty of summer flowers and the bounty of the autumn harvest, gives you a real feel good factor. It just makes you happy!”The winning entries from the photography competition will be displayed in the castle during its ‘4 Ps in our garden’ which runs on Saturday 30 and Sunday 31 May.Diana continued: “Our event involves photography, poetry, people focused workshops and planting. We will be celebrating the magic of trees with a special tree walk; marvelling at the beauty of moths with the Aberdeenshire Moth Group; creating Chelsea Bonnets using natural materials, planting a door step herb garden in a bag for life, and the Lemon Tree Writers Group have composed a new poetry collection for the inaugural Scottish Chelsea Fringe. There will also be a wishing tree for visitors to hang their own thoughts, willow weaving workshops, and stories being ‘woven’ around the garden.”Entry cost £4 for adults, £2 for children, £10 for a family.

A hospital failed to carry out tests for malnutrition on a number of elderly patients within the necessary time, inspectors have found.The checks - known as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) - should be carried out within 24 hours of a patient being admitted.But inspectors found that 18 out of 33 patients whose records they reviewed were not tested in the target time at the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy, Fife.In the case of one patient the test was not carried out until two weeks after they were admitted, while another had to wait nine days.Healthcare Improvement Scotland (HIS) identified 10 areas for improvement in the report, which NHS Fife must address "as a matter of priority".These include ensuring nutritional screening is carried out for all patients within 24 hours of admission.However inspectors also noted nine areas of good practice.The unannounced inspection was carried out from Tuesday February 17 to Thursday February 19 as part of the HIS programme of inspections on the standard of care for older people in acute care in Scotland.During their visit inspectors also noted that completion of fluid balance charts showing how much a patient had drunk was "generally poor" and the completion of food record charts "variable".The health board has been asked to ensure food and fluid balance charts are started and accurately completed for patients who require them and appropriate action is taken in relation to intake or output.Jacqui Macrae, HIS head of quality of care, said: "This inspection found evidence that NHS Fife have made significant improvements following our previous inspections in May and December 2013."In particular, we found the completion of adults with incapacity documentation and the completion of assessments for patients on admission to hospital had improved."Staff told us they felt supported and we saw evidence that the majority of wards had made changes to improve the environment for patients with dementia."However, we did identify areas where NHS Fife must improve the care provided to older people. For instance, the completion of fluid balance and food record charts was poor, and medical and nursing documentation was not always dated and timed."This inspection resulted in 10 areas for improvement and nine areas of good practice. NHS Fife must address the areas for improvement we have identified as a matter of priority."NHS Fife said it is working to address the issues raised in the report.Professor Scott McLean, director of acute services at NHS Fife, said: "NHS Fife welcomes today's report which highlights that significant improvements have been made in a number of areas and that patients felt positive about their care and treatment."The report notes new initiatives aimed at improving patient outcomes, good use of frailty assessments, well managed mealtimes, good teamwork and strong leadership within wards, alongside ongoing work to support patient flow."Whilst these improvements are encouraging, we would reassure patients and their families that action is being taken to address the areas highlighted by the inspectors which require further work."A comprehensive plan has been drawn up to address the issues raised, with many actions already under way."

Durban - Another home was set alight in the continuing faction violence in KwaMaphumulo, near KwaDukuza, this time on Sunday night.The feuding areas, KwaNdaba and KwaMzulini, have experienced a series of gun and fire attacks over the past week when three people were killed and three homes burnt.Speaking about Sunday’s incident, which occurred in the KwaNdaba area, a neighbour said he first heard several gunshots from a distance and when he peeked through his window, one house belonging to the Manqele family was ablaze.“I later learnt from a family member that they had also hadgunshots fired into their home,” said the neighbour who asked to remain anonymous.The local induna, Bongani Khanyile, said he received a call from a member of the family at about 8pm letting him know that they had been attacked.The affected family was not available for comment.A years-old stick-fighting incident between young men from the two warring areas in which one man was killed is said to be the cause of the continuing violence.Provincial police spokes-man, Colonel Jay Naicker, confirmed that three cases of arson were being investigated by the KwaMaphumulo police.He could not yet confirm Sunday’s incident.Naicker said no arrests had been made in the arson and murder cases and investigations were continuing.Meanwhile, the police have appealed to anyone with information about the killing of four men, including a Tactical Response Team police officer, in eZakheni, Ladysmith, on Friday night, to come forward.Constable Mboniseni Zungu, 33, Nkosiyakhe Mabaso, 33, Thanda, 31, whose surname had not yet been established, and a fourth person who had not been officially identified, were found dead with multiple bullet wounds inside a silver-grey VW Polo just before 8pm.Police said a number of heavy calibre cartridges were recovered at the scene.KZN police commissioner, Lieutenant General Mmamonnye Ngobeni, condemned the killings, saying that the SAPS had suffered a great loss in Zungu.

Beirut: Ayham al-Ahmad sits cross-legged atop a building damaged by mortar fire, a small electric keyboard across his knees, as the camera pans across the devastated buildings of Yarmouk and his latest song rings out over the rooftops.Since the so-called Islamic State laid siege to the devastated Palestinian refugee camp just outside Damascus, 27-year-old Ahmad, the renowned piano player of Yarmouk, can no longer roll his treasured piano on his uncle's vegetable cart and play music in the grim laneways.Under threat from the extremist group that for now controls much of the camp, he is less mobile but far from silent, as his friend, co-composer and Yarmouk exile Abo Gabi, told Fairfax Media.A Palestinian-Syrian musician and filmmaker, 31-year-old Abo Gabi fled Yarmouk in May 2013, six months after the clashes between Syrian regime forces and the Palestinian militant group PFLP-GC on one side and Syrian rebels on the other marked the moment the camp became one of the most vicious epicentres of Syria's four-year civil war."For us, it became a milestone when in December 2012 the camp was hit by air strikes," Abo Gabi says. "People started to say . . . before the MiG [fighter jet] and after the MiG."Since then the situation inside the camp - established in 1957 and once home to 180,000 Palestinian refugees and their families who were forced to flee from what is now Israel - has moved beyond desperate, he says."In Aleppo there have been barrel bombs and mortars being thrown over the people but they can still eat. In Yarmouk, people are dying of starvation and the UN is unable to convince the regime to send in food for people," Abo Gabi says."Meanwhile, only 50 metres from the entrance to the camp people are living a normal life - they have supermarkets, bakeries, they go to the mosque . . . so the tragedy is increasing, everyone is waiting for the death of another, sons are watching their elderly fathers die, nobody knows who will die first."IS militants overran much of Yarmouk early this month, giving the group its first stronghold close to Damascus, just over six kilometres away. The renewed fighting has pushed more of the area's remaining 16,000 residents - including 3500 children who have already endured a two-year siege and ongoing bombardment from Syrian regime forces - close to starvation and death, the United Nations has warned.An activist from inside Yarmouk who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals from all the warring factions told Fairfax Media via text message that rumours IS had agreed to leave the camp were premature. He says there were renewed clashes in the south of the camp between the Palestinian Aknaf Beit al-Maqdis militia and IS fighters, backed by militia from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front.Salim Salameh, head of the Palestinian League for Human Rights Syria and a former Yarmouk resident, says many inside the camp are back to consuming water with spices, "the famous meal people had during 2014 when starvation took the lives of around 200 people".  "This news is extremely scary because it means the basic food storage which people had accumulated in the 2½-year siege is already exhausted," Mr Salameh, who is now based in Sweden, told Fairfax Media.Along with the threat of starvation, the Syrian regime forces dropped two barrel bombs on the one remaining hospital that is still operating inside Yarmouk on April 9, further eroding what's left of the healthcare infrastructure of the camp. There are just 42 medical workers - two of them doctors - left in the camp with next to no medication for pre- or post-emergency treatment, he warned.On Monday, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) announced it had distributed humanitarian assistance to 500 civilians in the nearby neighbourhood of Yalda, to which many of Yarmouk's residents have fled. However the security situation remains so dangerous that UNRWA remains unable to enter the camp and provide aid to those most in need.Ayham al-Ahmad and Abo Gabi remain separated by the siege - a situation beautifully and painfully illustrated in Abo Gabi's short film  Blue, set on the grim streets of Yarmouk and featuring the pianist's pointed, political compositions.In the film, young men gather around his piano, Ahmad at the keys, and they sing with gusto: "What is with these days, the world sends delegations, delegates come and go, delegations multiply and so do their promises, while our people die.""I think about nothing but music," Ahmad says in Blue. "The future is a nasty question." Then there is the sound of mortars and the group quickly moves the battered piano to a safer location.Fairfax Media was unable to contact Ahmad for this story - Abo Gabi says it is increasingly difficult to connect with people in the camp, such is the chaos that surrounds them."Now we are composing a song together over the internet, I am writing the lyrics for Ayham and he will compose the music," Abo Gabi says.With friends in Yarmouk, he became involved with Palestinians Gathering For Creativity, so young people in the camp could come together and explore their creativity despite the suffering, he says. "We started with stand-up comedy during the war, we used to focus on social issues and later on when the siege began on the camp, the focus turned towards politics and speaking about the revolution."These days most of those involved in the Gathering have fled and are scattered around the world, and the two artistic collaborators struggle to connect between Paris and Damascus via what little internet service there is left in Yarmouk."As a refugee, the film [Blue] reflects the suffering of the people, the way they are having to live there in Yarmouk, where there is nothing except death for them," Abo Gabi says. "I am showing the presence of death along with the presence of the living."
Chinese police have quietly travelled to  the eastern suburbs of Melbourne to "persuade" a Chinese-born tour bus driver to return and face bribery charges in China.It is believed to be the first confirmed account of Chinese officers travelling to a Western country to deal directly with targets of Chinese President Xi Jinping's expanding "Operation Fox Hunt" campaign, aimed at repatriating corrupt officials and seizing their hidden assets overseasTwo officers from the iron ore port city of Rizhao were sent to Melbourne late last year to negotiate directly with Dong Feng, 49.Mr Dong works as a bus driver for Chinese tour groups and lives in Glen Waverley with his wife, Yang Xiaomei, and their school-aged daughter, all of whom are believed to be naturalised Australian citizens.A Rizhao police officer with direct knowledge of the investigation said he believed his colleagues had travelled in an unofficial capacity, raising questions as to whether Australian police or diplomats were notified of the repatriation efforts being carried out on Australian soil."We first contacted [Dong] from China, but he didn't quite believe what we were saying over the phone, he said it would be best if we spoke face to face," said the officer, who is attached to the city's economic crimes unit. "This is why we went, in December 2014."The high priority that Mr Xi has given Fox Hunt and its sister campaign, Sky Net, has raised incentives and pressures for police officials at all tiers of Chinese government to bring fugitives back home and uncover hidden assets.An Interpol notice against Mr Dong describes his alleged crime as "bribery" but does not mention that the amounts in question are relatively small by contemporary Chinese standards, that they relate to Mr Dong's work at a private company and that Mr Dong contests the allegations.Nor does the notice mention that Mr Dong is a practitioner of Falun Gong, which is banned as a subversive "cult" in China.Mr Xi's fox-hunting efforts have led to the extradition of 290 alleged fugitives from 69 countries, according to official figures from December. But those efforts have been frustrated by cautious government responses in Western nations including Australia, which is commonly listed as a top-three destination for Chinese fugitives.Chinese police have attempted to work around diplomatic obstacles by raising the importance of "persuasion work", which typically involves applying pressure upon family members who remain in mainland China."A fugitive is like a kite, the body is overseas but the thread is inside China - through family and friends, [we] can always find them," Li Gongjin, team leader of Shanghai police's economic crimes unit, told Xinmin Weekly in an interview late last year.Chinese authorities say 390 alleged fugitives had returned "voluntarily", according to the December figures.Anecdotal examples, however, suggest that at least some of these fox-hunting successes may not be living up to their billing.The case of Mr Dong was trumpeted by a local Communist Party newspaper as a successful example of "persuasion" work as part of Operation Fox Hunt.  The report confirmed the police visits to Australia and claimed that Mr Dong's wife had returned to China and Mr Dong was likely to follow suit.Fairfax understands that Mr Dong has misgivings about returning with his wife and daughter but nevertheless agreed to meet the visiting Chinese police because of concerns about the welfare of his wife's elderly parents back in China.Contrary to the Chinese newspaper report, however, Ms Yang brought her parents back to join her in Melbourne last week, rather than the other way around.The Australian Federal Police declined to say whether they were aware that Rizhao police had travelled to Australia to meet alleged fugitives in December. "This is not an AFP investigation," said a spokesperson for the Australian Federal Police. "Questions relating to this Chinese investigation should be directed to the Chinese authorities."A spokeswoman for Justice Minister Michael Keenan said only that the two countries have developed "productive" areas of mutual assistance.Mr Dong declined to speak directly with Fairfax when approached at his home and contacted via friends.Rizhao police allege a Shanxi coal company paid more than 1 million yuan ($214,000) in bribes to Mr Dong and his wife between 2005 and 2007 by transferring money onto two bankcards for their use. Police say the couple fled to Australia in 2009 when they began to investigate.Mr Dong has told friends that the matter was fabricated by "a former boss he had offended" at his company, the privately-owned Rizhao Steel, one of Australia's most important iron ore customers.In another case, reported last week, a former Chinese boss of a multibillion-dollar conglomerate, Zheng Jiefu, said he had been followed around Melbourne's bayside suburbs in connection with a corruption case involving China's former deputy spy chief.Mr Zheng said he did not know whether his stalkers were working for or against Mr Xi's corruption fighters and that he would not return to assist investigations in China until he received high-level safety guarantees.
New York: A handwritten notebook by British World War II code-breaking genius Alan Turing, who was the subject of the 2014 Oscar-winning film The Imitation Game, brought more than $US1 million at auction in New York.The 56-page manuscript was written at the time the mathematician and computer science pioneer was working to break the seemingly unbreakable Enigma codes used by the Germans throughout the war.It contains Turing's complex mathematical and computer science notations, and is believed to be the only extensive Turing manuscript known to exist, according to Bonhams, the auction house.The Imitation Game starring Benedict Cumberbatch in the role of Turing, won Best Adapted Screenplay at this year's Academy Awards.Turing's notebook dates from 1942, when he and his team of cryptanalysts were at Britain's World War II code and cypher school Bletchley Park. In one entry, Turing writes about a complex calculus notation."The Leibniz notation I find extremely difficult to understand in spite of it having been the one I understood the best once! It certainly implies that some relation between x and y has been laid down eg, y(equals)x2+3x."Turing was prosecuted for being gay at a time when it was illegal in Britain.He was convicted of indecency in 1952 and agreed to undergo hormone treatment as an alternative to imprisonment to "cure" his homosexuality.He died in 1954 of cyanide poisoning. It was ruled a suicide although his family and friends believed it might have been accidental. The notebook was among the papers he left in his will to friend and fellow mathematician Robin Gandy.
OTTAWA - Canada will send 200 military trainers to Ukraine, joining the U.S. and Britain in an international effort to shore up the eastern European country's battered and bloodied combat forces.Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Defence Minister Jason Kenney announced the long-anticipated move Tuesday at National Defence headquarters.The troops will join American and British soldiers early this summer, and the mission will last until March 31, 2017.Harper says Canada's latest military contribution addresses a number of requests from the government of Ukraine, is being provided to help the country in its efforts to maintain sovereignty, security and stability in the face of Russian aggression.Most of the Canadian trainers are expected to be housed at an existing NATO training centre located in Yavoriv, in the western portion of the embattled European country, near the Polish border.However, some instruction will also take place at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence Demining Centre in Kamyanets-Podilsky, also in western Ukraine.
A California police officer was put on administrative leave after he "manipulated" the body of a man who had been shot dead by police, including tickling the man's feet and attempting to open his mouth, according to officials and local media.The Bakersfield Police Department said in a statement on Monday that senior officer Aaron Stringer improperly touched the body of Ramiro Villegas inside a hospital room last November, a day after the man had been shot dead by police.The statement did not elaborate on Stringer's actions but said he was placed on leave the next day.The Bakersfield Californian newspaper reported on Friday that he pretended to tickle Villegas' feet and tried to pry open his mouth.The newspaper, citing reports it obtained from the department, said he told another officer at the hospital that he "loves playing with dead bodies," before laughing.The Californian said Stringer was not permitted by the county coroner's office to touch the body. It quoted the department's reports as saying he declined to comment on the allegations and had hired an attorney.Police said officers shot Villegas dead the night of Nov. 13 at the end of a brief high-speed pursuit, when he got out of his car and "aggressively" approached officers before he "reached towards his front waistband."No weapon was found at the scene.In February, the Kern County District Attorney's Office declined to bring criminal charges in the case, the statement said.The Californian reported that Villegas' family has filed a claim against the city over the shooting.
The brother of missing student Karen Buckley has appealed for anyone who may have seen her to contact policeThe brother of missing student Karen Buckley has appealed for anyone who may have seen her to contact police. Speaking from Sydney, Kieran Buckley told Newstalk’s Lunchtime presenter Jonathan Healy that his sister “would always contact someone and would always come home.”The 24-year-old student nurse from Mourneabbey in Co Cork has been missing since Sunday morning after leaving a Glasgow nightclub.“It’s very tough on everyone, so we are just trying to stay positive. Hopefully some good news comes soon, that I don’t know, some crazy excuse for Karen’s disappearance... that she just turns up safe and sound somewhere, we are all just hoping. That’s all we can do now really, just put our trust in the police in Glasgow,” Mr Buckley said.He was made aware that his sister was missing on Monday morning [Sunday night UK time].“I’m over here with my brother [Damian] in Sydney, so it’s very tough for both of us right now.“I found out on Monday morning early, I woke up, my brother told me she was missing and that was it, that’s all we know. That was Sunday night back in the UK, we are just hoping Karen would just turn up, maybe her phone went dead, or she lost her phone or something like that, it happens,” he said.Mr Buckley plans to travel to Glasgow from Sydney to support his parents in the search for Karen, who went missing after telling friends she was going to a nightclub toilet.“It’s not her character at all, it’s just very strange, [that she is] just missing. She would always contact someone, she would always come home. It’s very strange. I don’t know what has happened, but it’s not like her to just go missing, it’s out of character obviously,” Mr Buckley said.He appealed to anyone with information to contact police in Glasgow.He plans to, “Just get more coverage out there, and if anyone has information, or recognises her, that’s just vital to get to the police, that is the main reason behind the Facebook page, to get awareness [out there],” he said.Parishioners in the Buckley family’s native Mourneabbey, outside Mallow in Co Cork have organised a special Mass on Wednesday night (Wednesday) at Analeentha Church at 8pm to offer prayers for the missing student.
For the past decade, Australia has been one of the more consistent supporters of American military interventions in the Middle East. This week, the government of Prime Minister Tony Abbott announced it was deploying some additional 300 troops to Iraq, where a U.S.-led coalition is attempting to push back against the advances of the extremist Islamic State.On Tuesday, Australia's Defense Minister Kevin Andrews appeared in a meaty prime-time interview on ABC News, a major Australian network, discussing the role these personnel will play in the wider fight against the jihadists.It reaches a pretty awkward moment, though, when interviewer Leigh Sales queries him about the Islamic State's leadership structure, and then repeatedly asks him to name the organization's leader (Hint: he's pictured above). Andrews, though, demurs, citing "operational matters" and the "fluidity" of the situation even though Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is well known to all and has a $10 million U.S. State Department bounty on his head.Here's the video and transcript of the cringe-worthy exchange:LEIGH SALES: At the start of the war on terror, back after 9/11, the military campaign was heavily focused on the leadership of al-Qaeda, and it remained so for a long time. When it comes to IS, who is the top leader and what sort of focus is there on his capture? KEVIN ANDREWS: Well, there's a cadre of leaders, if you like, in the ISIL forces. And we're not just dealing with one organization. There's fluidity between organizations and individuals who are involved, and that's why… and that's… LEIGH SALES: No, but there is a leader and a cabinet of IS; they run like a government? KEVIN ANDREWS: And, and that makes it more difficult in terms of the overall objective that we're seeking to achieve here. But we will continue along the lines that we are. We're in constant discussion… LEIGH SALES: So, so, sorry, just to be clear: Who is the leader and what is the focus on his capture? KEVIN ANDREWS: Well, I'm not going to go into operational matters, obviously, Leigh. LEIGH SALES: Well, can you name the leader of IS? KEVIN ANDREWS: I'm not going to go into operational matters, but there are … LEIGH SALES: I don't think that's operational. I think it's a matter of public record? KEVIN ANDREWS: Leigh, I'm trying to answer your question as best as I can and that is, that ultimately our aim here is to degrade and to defeat ISIL. Now, ISIL operates not just in Iraq but across Syria as well, and there is fluidity between groups. There's not just one group involved and not one just group of individuals involved and so we have to counter that as best we can over the coming weeks and months. LEIGH SALES: Minister, you're responsible for putting Australian men and women in harm's way in the cause of this mission. I'm surprised that you can't tell me the name of Islamic State's leader. The U.S. State Department has a $10 million bounty on his head? KEVIN ANDREWS: Well, as I said, ISIL is a combination of groups, Leigh. There is not just one individual involved in this. There are Australians involved in the senior leadership of ISIL or DAISH, and there is a fluidity between groups that we've seen over the past few months in that area. It's not just one person involved. There's a series of people involved, and we must ultimately destroy all of them if we're going to degrade their operations in that area. LEIGH SALES: The specific person to whom I have been referring is Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Andrews has only been in his current post since a cabinet reshuffle in December. His government has been particularly concerned with the Islamic State, which has successfully recruited a number of jihadists from Australia's Muslim population.
China must carry out promised reforms and rebalance its economy to stem financial risks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said Tuesday, as it pointed to slowing growth over the next two years.The IMF estimated that the world's second-largest economy will grow 6.8 percent in 2015 before slowing to 6.3 percent in 2016, maintaining its previous predictions from January."For China, the main risk is failure to implement the reform agenda to address financial risks, rebalance the economy, and tap new sources of growth," the Washington-based Fund said in its latest World Economic Outlook."Without reforms to change the pattern of growth, vulnerabilities will continue to increase, and the available policy space will shrink," it added.The expected decline in growth from last year's 7.4 percent comes "as previous excesses in real estate, credit, and investment continue to unwind", it said, describing "an unsustainable pattern of growth that has led to rising vulnerabilities in the corporate, financial, and government sectors".The IMF's estimate for this year matches the median forecast in an AFP poll of 15 economists earlier this week.The National Bureau of Statistics will release the official gross domestic product (GDP) figures for the first quarter on Wednesday. China's GDP probably expanded 6.9 percent in January-March, the AFP survey showed, down from 7.3 percent in the final three months of last year.Separately, the World Bank said on Monday that China's economy should grow by 7.1 percent in 2015, slower than the 7.2 percent rate it projected in October.The Chinese government in March announced an official growth target of about 7.0 percent for this year, below last year's objective of about 7.5 percent.The forecasts come as Beijing seeks to transition China's economy from its old model of investment-fuelled growth that resulted in years of double-digit GDP expansion but is now seen as unsustainable.Authorities have expressed a willingness to accept lower growth rates as they try to make consumer spending the key driver of activity.But investment remains crucial and the IMF cited its possible intensified deceleration, including in real estate, as a near-term risk, after a slowdown last year that followed a 2009-2012 boom."Some further slowdown is already factored into the baseline, but it could be stronger than expected, as striking a balance between reducing vulnerabilities, supporting growth, and implementing reforms remains challenging," the report said.It specifically called for resource allocation efficiency to be improved with reforms in financial and state-owned enterprises."Reforms in the pension system and other social safety net areas will help shift the composition of growth toward domestic consumption, which is likely to prove more sustainable in the long term," it added.The IMF also forecast that China's consumer inflation rate will fall to 1.2 percent this year after hitting 2.0 percent last year, before rebounding to 1.5 percent next year.Beijing is forecasting consumer inflation of about three percent for this year.Economists have expressed concerns about the risk of deflation in China, especially after January's slump in consumer inflation to 0.8 percent, the lowest since November 2009.
The International Monetary Fund cut its outlook for US economic growth this year and next on Tuesday after a sharp slowdown during the winter.But it said the country will remain the key driver of the global economy, and weather the negative impacts of the strong dollar.In its semi-annual World Economic Outlook, the global crisis lender trimmed half a percentage point from its forecast for US growth in 2015 to 3.1 percent, which it branded "solid".It also cut 0.2 percent from the 2016 forecast, also to 3.1 percent.Just three months ago the Fund raised its prediction, expecting that a surge in hiring and consumer spending, and the plunge in oil prices, would add fuel to the country's pull away from the legacy of the 2008 financial crisis.But a downturn through the first quarter of the year suggested continued weaknesses that have trimmed expectations for the world's largest economy.Even so, the IMF said, the US economy has remained resilient to weaker external conditions and the surging dollar."Consumption -- the main engine of growth --has benefited from steady job creation and income growth, lower oil prices, and improved consumer confidence.""Conditions remain in place for robust US economic performance in 2015."The Fund's view for the US economy was more optimistic than that of the Federal Reserve, which said in mid-March that growth would be at best only 2.7 percent this year and next.For the near term, the main challenge is normalizing monetary policy, the IMF said.Even with that, the fallout of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates from the zero level is mainly going to impact other countries. Americans should weather the stronger dollar that could result from higher interest rates, even as it crimps exports.Cheap oil, tame inflation, and improved household and corporate finances should offset the dollar factor.However, the IMF said, the country faces a significant challenge of slow growth over the medium term, which signals the need for strong policy measures to invest for future growth."Potential growth is estimated to be only about 2.0 percent, weighed down by an aging population and weak innovation and productivity growth," it said.The Fund said Washington needs "an ambitious agenda of supply-side policies" on top of the priorities of closing the country's budget gap and lowering its borrowing needs.That includes, the IMF said, infrastructure investment that would have "relatively modest" costs in the near term and "important benefits" for long term output potential."Building political consensus around a medium term fiscal consolidation plan and supply-side reforms to boost medium-term growth -- including simplifying the tax system, investing in infrastructure and human capital, and immigration reform -- will continue to be a challenge," it said.

The U.S. and the African Union on Monday signed an agreement to create the African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.U.S. Secretary of State, John Kerry, and the, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, signed a memo of cooperation.The document formalised the collaboration between the African Union Commission and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“The West African Ebola epidemic reaffirmed the need for a public health institute to support African ministries of health and other health agencies.“This is in their efforts to prevent, detect, and respond to any disease outbreak,” CDC director Dr Thomas Frieden said in a statement.The African CDC is slated to be inaugurated later in 2015 with the opening of a surveillance and response unit.According to the statement, the unit will provide technical expertise and help coordinate response to health emergencies. As part of the agreement, the U.S. CDC will send two public health experts to serve as long-term technical advisers to the African CDC. The U.S. will also support fellowships for 10 African epidemiologists to help staff five regional African CDC coordinating centers.The centres are being established to help monitor disease activity on the continent.

Two people have been killed in a microlight plane crash in the NSW northern tablelands on Sunday morning.About 10.30am emergency services were called to a property off Nine Mile Road, north of Glen Innes, following reports of a plane crash.Both the 51-year-old male pilot and the 55-year-old female passenger - the only people on board - were pronounced dead at the scene. The pair are from the Oak Flats area, just south of Wollongong.The pair were staying at the Glen River B&B Farmstay at Dundee, north of Glen Innes, near where the accident  occured.The B&B farmstay is known for recreational flying and hosts two private airstrips for microlight pilots,with a longer airstrip for light aircraft nearby.It is understood that the victims were friends of the owners of the property.A Civil Aviation Safety Authority spokesman said that as it was a microlight crash it would not necessarily be investigated by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau.Police have established a crime scene and are investigating the cause of the crash.They will prepare a report for the coroner.
But the teenager's life now is one that was unimaginable 12 months ago.On April 14 last year, she was in a packed dormitory at the Government Girls Secondary School in Chibok, northeastern Nigeria, seeking a night's sleep before writing end-of-term exams.The mass abduction provoked global outrage and brought unprecedented attention to an insurgency that has devastated northern Nigeria since 2009.Deborah was one of 57 girls who escaped within hours of the attack. Her life has changed but for the other 219 hostages still being held and for families desperate for news, the nightmare continues.Despite promises from the government and military that the release or rescue of the hostages was at hand, there has been no credible information concerning their whereabouts in months.Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau vowed to sell the girls as "slaves" and later said they had been "married off". Experts say both are possible and they are unlikely to still be all together.Deborah and 20 other girls from Chibok who escaped Boko Haram captivity are now studying at the American University of Nigeria (AUN) in the northeastern city of Yola.The privately-funded AUN does not look like other Nigerian universities and certainly bears little resemblance to Chibok, which even before the Islamist uprising began was a deeply impoverished town with poor roads and limited electricity supply.Spread across a vast stretch of land on the outskirts of Yola, the campus includes an immaculate hotel, with a restaurant overlooking a pool that serves burgers and pizza, where faculty, including visiting Western professors, share sodas with their students."It is a beautiful environment," Deborah told AFP via university staff in an email exchange.The Chibok girls at AUN are studying a curriculum aimed at preparing them to start a four-year undergraduate programme next year.Deborah said her dream is to work at the United Nations "to help my community in Chibok, Nigeria and the world".Others talk of becoming doctors or lawyers. All stress the importance of education. With degrees from the well-regarded AUN those dreams may come true.But among the 21, the prospects feel bittersweet, as international attention returns to the plight of those still being held one year on.Thoughts of their missing classmates are never far away and in their prayers daily, they said."We feel sad with the advantages we have now because so many from our hometown do not have these advantages," they added.They also acknowledged they would almost certainly not be studying at the university had they not been kidnapped.Mary put this conflict in starker terms: "When the insurgency struck, I was devastated but little did I know it was going to be a blessing in disguise."The Chibok girls at AUN felt united in a common goal to ensure that some good must come from last year's tragedy."It has been a horrible journey yet we believe that coming to AUN is for a purpose, which is to be an instrument of positive change in our hometown," Sarah said."We have not been broken by the attack. We see ourselves as the people who have been chosen to make positive future changes not just in Chibok, but in our country and the world," she added.President Goodluck Jonathan's handling of the hostage crisis was heavily criticised, especially over his administration's failure to immediately recognise the severity of the attack and to swiftly launch a major rescue effort.Jonathan's defeat in last month's general election to challenger Muhammadu Buhari may have partly been caused by his inability to contain the Islamist violence.Boko Haram, whose name loosely translates from the Hausa language widely spoken in northern Nigeria as "Western education is forbidden", had already been suspected of committing crimes against humanity before the Chibok mass abduction focused global outrage.But the girls studying at AUN suggested the Islamist foot-soldiers who carried out the kidnappings ultimately deserve mercy.Northeastern Nigeria provides few opportunities and little hope of employment for young men, making them vulnerable to radicalisation, they said."I forgive Boko Haram for what they have done and I pray God forgives them too," Blessing said.
The roads around Nottingham are mostly quiet but it is the train tracks where delays have struck.A signal box had to be evacuated near Kings Cross, meaning trains to the London station were cancelled.The incident took place at around 7am, and although the line has now reopened, residual delays of up to one hour 10 minutes have been caused.On the roads, continuing work on the A453 at Clifton is still causing short delays, which are expected to get worse as the days goes on and traffic gets heavier.The A612 in Lowdham is also experiencing slow traffic, while the closure of Forest Lane in Papplewick is also causing small delays.
A brand of bleach in the U.S. has been forced to apologise after a tweet that was deemed racially insensitive.Clorox tweeted ‘where’s the bleach’ with a picture made up of lots of emojis following the introduction of new cartoons for iPhones last week.The problem is that the focus of reports was on the introduction of a new collection of racially diverse faces.Clorox said it was trying to make a humorous reference to other emoji symbols for objects like toilets and bathtubs.But it fell flat with some.Student Jazzmen Knoderer, 29, said: ‘I didn’t think it was malicious, but impact negates intent. This is someone being thoughtless, and really not focused on what was trending that day.Clorox has since apologised with this tweet:And a statement: ‘We did not mean for this to be taken as a specific reference to the diversity emojis – but we should have been more aware of the news around this.‘The tweet was meant to be light-hearted – about having an emoji shaped like a bleach bottle to represent doing laundry or cleaning – but it fell flat.’
When former St Kilda coach Scott Watters called Dermott Brereton looking for a key defender, the five-time Hawthorn premiership hero had no hesitation in suggesting Josh Bruce.Now Brereton says Bruce could develop into St Kilda's version of Cameron Mooney and could help extend Saints captain Nick Riewoldt's career.Bruce starred in St Kilda's 28-point victory over Gold Coast on Saturday, kicking a career-best six goals against the Suns.It almost doubled his career tally to 15 goals from 26 games.The Canberra product started out as a forward for Eastlake and kicked the Giants' first ever goal on Manuka Oval, but GWS decided to turn him into a defender because they also had the likes of Jeremy Cameron.But Bruce struggled for opportunities and had open ears when St Kilda came calling at Brereton's behest.Brereton had worked with Bruce at GWS, where he does some coaching of their key forwards.Saints coach Alan Richardson has switched him back forward and he's enjoying a breakout 2015.In round one he took a contender for mark of the year, which Brereton said helped Bruce "believe he belonged", and he's followed that up with a match-winning haul."Scotty called me and said, 'Who's not getting a game at GWS? They're full of talent,' and I said, 'This kid's good, he's a ripping competitor and he's got a great attitude ... I don't know if he's in their long-term plans. This kid deserves a real go at it'," Brereton said.He thinks the 22-year-old could emulate Mooney's career, saying the triple-premiership player wasn't the most talented player, but had turned himself into a "champion team man" through hard work."He should model his game on the likes of Cam Mooney, he's not going to be a Wayne Carey," Brereton said."Mooney turned himself from a toiler into a champion team man in the key focal position."One thing I'd say for Bruce, even though he's going super well, there's a whole lot of hard work ahead of him ... because even if he dominates a team, he has to do it with hard work and running."Brereton also felt Bruce's continued emergence could take the heat off Riewoldt and enable the 32-year-old to play on longer.He said it would also enable Riewoldt to play more one-on-one, rather than be swamped with defenders, and make it easier for the veteran."If somebody else can take the true heat and take the real physical bash-up that Nick's position always receives, if that can be Josh Bruce, he'll prolong Riewoldt's career by an extra year," he said.Bruce was full of praise for his captain, saying Riewoldt's work - along with that of his midfield - had provided space for him to move in.He again showed his ability to take strong, contested marks.But Bruce deflected the praise, happier to get the first win of the season rather than accept personal praise."I wouldn't have gotten on the end of any of them without [Riewoldt's] work up the field and obviously all the midfielders applying pressure," Bruce said."It was a whole team effort and I was just lucky enough to get on the end of a few."Bruce now has the chance to shine on the big stage when St Kilda take on Collingwood at the MCG on Friday night.
They were reported to have split up last month, but Bradley Cooper and Suki Waterhouse still look pretty smitten with each other.The pair were pictured sharing a hug and talking intently at Coachella on Friday night and now more shots of the ex-couple have surfaced.Fresh pictures show the Hollywood actor and model rattling around the famous festival on a golf buggy.Bradley, dressed in a blue jacket and shorts, is sat behind Clint Eastwood (yes, really) and a woman driving the buggy, while model Suki is sat at the back next to a female pal.Last month it was reported the pair had split after dating for two years, but judging by these pictures have clearly remained close friends.Following the split a source told People magazine the pair had parted ways before the Academy Awards in January, which they attended together.Yes, yes that is Suki there on the back of the buggyThe news came shortly after an insider said Suki was keen on marrying the Hollywood hunk.An insider shared: "Suki says she's been warming him up to the idea ofmarriage and he's starting to get excited about it."It's up to Bradley to pop the question, of course, but she hopes it happens soon."Could they be rekindling their romance? Hmm.Oh, and there's Clint Eastwood
