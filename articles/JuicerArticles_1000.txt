It may no longer be “America’s game” at the turnstiles or in the ratings, but baseball has always ruled on the big-screen. Hundreds of baseball movies have been made, and they number among the best sports movies ever.Maybe there’s something inherently relatable about baseball players. They don’t have to be seven-feet tall or 300-plus pounds. You wouldn’t find a physique like David Wells or Prince Fielder in any other sport, except maybe golf… or bowling.And the almost cosmic intangibility of the sport – dependent as it is on “breaks” – lends itself to bigger thoughts about life. Or maybe to a stray fastball in the groin. Whatever.On the occasion of the upcoming Blue Jays home opener, here’s an entirely subjective list of best, worsts and random observations about assorted baseball movies.Kevin Costner. He starred in arguably the best sports movie of all time, 1988’s Bull Durham and cemented his rep as the “baseball guy” the next year with Field of Dreams. He returned to the diamond in 1999 in Sam Raimi’s For the Love of the Game playing a pitcher whose last start, a nothing game against the Yankees, turns into one for the ages (punctuated by flashbacks). By accounts, Costner was a pretty good high school pitcher, too.Charlie Sheen in Major League (1989). As Ricky “Wild Thing” Vaughn, he took to the field like a gladiator with The Troggs’ biggest hit as a theme song, leaving everyone within 30 feet of the plate trembling in fear of something “just a little outside.” He’s everybody's favourite Wild Thing, except in Toronto, where Mitch "Wild Thing" Williams gave up the Series-winning homer to Joe Carter.Anthony Perkins as Jimmy Piersall in 1957’S Fear Strikes Out. Excellent movie. Should have hired a stunt double though. Runners up: John Goodman as Babe Ruth in The Babe (1992) and – I’m gonna say it – Gary Cooper as Lou Gehrig in Pride of the Yankees (1942).Brendan Fraser in The Scout. Widely considered one of the worst baseball movies ever. Released, appropriately enough, during the 1994 strike season.Animals playing baseball. We’re speaking specifically of Bud the golden retriever in Air Bud: Seventh Inning Fetch (2002) and Ed, the chimp in 1996’s Ed (for identification purposes, Ed’s co-star Matt Leblanc was the one who spoke words).From Moneyball. “An ugly girlfriend means no confidence, OK? I’m just saying, we are trying to replace Giambi and this guy’s girlfriend is a six at best.”A KID SAID THAT IN A FAMILY COMEDY? MAN, THE ‘70s WERE A DIFFERENT TIME:“All we got on this team are a buncha Jews, s---, n----, pansies, and a booger-eatin' moron!” Jackie Earle Haley as Tanner Boyle in The Bad News Bears (1976).Tommy Lee Jones as Ty Cobb in Cobb (1994). As miserable an interviewee as Jones is, there may be ex-sportswriters still alive who can confirm that the Georgia Peach was a sumbitch on a whole other level.To Fever Pitch (2005), in which Jimmy Fallon learns to give up all hope of the Red Sox winning a Series and give in to loving Drew Barrymore. Except that the Curse of the Bambino was finally broken after principle filming ended and they had to frantically reshoot the ending.STILL SOLID ADVICE – I’M LOOKING AT YOU, JETER:“There’s no crying in baseball!” Tom Hanks in A League of Their Own (1992).WHAT PART OF ‘THERE’S NO CRYING IN BASEBALL’ DID YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?:Bang The Drum Slowly (1973), with Michael Moriarty and Robert De Niro as best-friend battery mates. Next to Brian’s Song, the #2 movie guys can’t watch without getting something in their eye.Robert Redford as 35-year-old rookie Roy Hobbs in The Natural (1984). Dennis Quaid as real-life 35-year-old rookie Jim Morris in The Rookie (2002).Making the baseball-obsessed J.D. Salinger-esque author in the book Shoeless Joe into a black character (James Earl Jones) in Field of Dreams. You guys do know that was Jim Crow baseball, right?MOST UNDERRATED BASEBALL MOVIE (OR WHAT’S A SCANDAL WITHOUT CHARLIE SHEEN?):Eight Men Out (1988), John Sayles’ movie about the Black Sox scandal, featured Sheen as Happy Felsch, John Cusack as Buck Weaver, a young Michael Rooker (The Walking Dead) as Chick Gandil and D.B. Sweeney as Shoeless Joe Jackson. Cool flick.Robert De Niro is the title character in 1996’s The Fan (a knife salesman no less) who stalks newly-acquired San Francisco Giant Wesley Snipes. Yikes.YOU NEVER SAW IT, AND THEY NEVER WENT ANYWHERE:Million Dollar Arm (2014), the true story of a sports agent (Jon Hamm) who signed two Indian cricket players to minor league baseball contracts.
Three indigenous languages still spoken in Canada are among a group being studied as researchers attempt to understand how children around the world learn their vastly different mother tongues.The global project — spearheaded by the University of Zurich — is looking at Dene, East Cree, and Inuktitut among 10 languages.Researchers already know that children have little problem learning to speak their native language. What's not well understood is exactly how this happens."We're trying to get a real sense of how children can acquire or learn any language in the world," Dagmar Jung, a senior researcher from the University of Zurich, said in an interview."It's a miracle that any child can actually learn any language it's exposed to when it's young."As part of the study, Jung and Olga Lovick, an associate linguistics professor at the First Nations University of Canada, were heading to the Clearwater River Dene Nation in northern Saskatchewan on Sunday.It's one of only three places in the world where children grow up speaking Dene.About 7,000 languages are spoken around the world but most research to date has focused on the structurally similar large European languages."The question is how do kids go about learning a language that is structurally so different as Dene?" Jung said from Regina.Jung, who plans an initial two-month stay with the Clearwater River Dene, and Lovick plan to train community members to record children of two or three years old and to write down what they say over the next year.Lovick will help co-ordinate the research, which will involve Dene language experts, research and recording assistants, as well as participating families.At one point, Canada was home to more than 70 distinct First Nations languages. Recent figures suggest about a dozen have disappeared altogether and the others — with few exceptions — are extremely endangered."By our being there and fostering this interest in children learning the language, we're hoping that maybe this will remind people how important it is to speak Dene to their kids so that they keep learning Dene," Lovick said. "In many other places it's too late."One aim of the research is to identify ways to teach First Nations languages more effectively to adults."We know how hard they are to learn as adults," Jung said. "So everybody is actually really excited to see finally how children do it because we just don't know how to do it easily."One idea — currently being challenged — is that children's brains have a "hard-wired" grammar module called Universal Grammar from which all human languages can be derived.Another idea is that learning a language relies on general cognitive mechanisms.Much of the initial research on Inuktitut and East Cree is already underway or been done.The other languages in the study are Turkish, Japanese, Russian, Sesotho, which is spoken in southern Africa, Yucatec Maya in Mexico, Chintang in Nepal, and Indonesian.
Taraji P. Henson knows it’s not her roles in The Karate Kid remake or Think Like A Man Too that brought her to the Saturday Night Live stage. She’s there because of the instant breakout of primetime soap opera, Empire and a certain loud and proud character named Cookie Lyons, a woman who hasn’t met a scene she couldn’t steal.But, it turns out Cookie couldn’t stay the whole night (she only appeared in one digital short) so her alter ego Henson was upstaged by Kate McKinnon in almost every single sketch.This is how the cookie crumbled.Hillary Clinton (Kate McKinnon) attempts to come off as warm and friendly while recording a video message declaring her candidacy for president. Instead, she has trouble unfreezing her face from a terrifying grin and shouts “Citizens! You will elect me as your leader!” The best part of this sketch was when former SNL star (and current announcer) Darrell Hammond walked in the shot to reprise his classic Bill Clinton impersonation. The real Bill and Hillary back on the campaign trail and Hammond back as the skirt-chasing ex-president. Everything old is new again – and it’s kind of cool.Henson waits until her second sentence before mentioning Cookie, so that shows some restraint. From there, the rest of the monologue is a souped-up, over-the-top show-stopper with Henson singing about how she’s “made it,” backed up with a full gospel choir. Yes, Taraji, you’ve made it. But you’re also a little pitchy. Nothing those Empire producers can’t fix with some Auto-Tune.McKinnon takes the lead again – this time as a loopy Liza Minnelli-type designer hawking a line of red, sparkly ponchos on shopping channel QVC. She claims the over-sized smocks can be worn three different ways – just don’t ask her what they are. After using a model (Aidy Bryant) to demonstrate that the poncho can be worn normally (that’s the first look) or stretched to the side to expose one shoulder (that’s the second) – she zones out and spends the rest of the segment cluelessly talking to unsatisfied customers on speakerphone while the host (Henson) tries to jog her memory.In a rip-off of A League of Their Own, the all-female and all-white baseball team balks at the thought of letting a black female (Henson) join the lineup. When Leslie Jones’ character (also black but bigger and taller with braided hair) inquires about joining, she’s met with looks of terror. Whoa. That’s a lot of race commentary crammed into such a short sketch, and that line about sending Jones’ character “overseas to kill some Krauts” was just mean. It got exactly zero laughs, too. Which is exactly the right amount.Henson comes to Sesame Street as her Empire character Cookie to tell off Ernie, intimidate Mr. Snuffleupagus and Big Bird, take cookies from Cookie Monster and…um…turn Elmo into a red fur coat. The Muppets were good sports about this one.With the release of their new album Wilder Mind, British band Mumford & Sons shows off their more guitar-heavy sound playing The Wolf as their first song, which is a burst of energy from start to finish and really gives their drummer a workout. They choose the slow-build Believe the second time out.
THE Corrs are mourning the death of their father who passed away after suffering a heart attack.It’s understood Gerry Corr, who lived in their native Dundalk, Co Louth, had a heart attack last Sunday and was taken to the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin before passing away on Thursday.His friend Fr Michael Cusack described Mr Corr, who was in his early seventies, as a man of “great faith” who was adored by his children.“I’m very sad to hear of his loss and so will his children be, they all adored him.“He was a very kind and decent man,” he said.Mr Corr’s wife Jean passed away in 1999 aged 57 from a lung condition.His removal will take place on Monday at 11.30am to The Church Of The Holy Redeemer in Dundalk for funeral mass followed by burial at St Patrick’s cemetery.
Holocaust survivor Heinrich Rotmensch returns to the concentration camp were 70 years ago he escaped from hours before he was due to die.Survivors of the Buchenwald concentration camp near the eastern German city of Weimar gathered on Saturday to commemorate the camp's liberation by American soldiers on 11 April, 1945.Among them was Rotmensch, who spent more than seven years in various concentration camps until the end of World War II.“I grew up in concentration camps and spent time in eight of them,” he said.“I was transferred from the Gross-Rosen Concentration Camp in Poland to the Buchenwald Concentration Camp. And then I was transferred to a small town in Tuttlingen.”A local German, Rotmensch studied, played, lived and grew up just like any other German children until his family’s Jewish identity was revealed.Taken by the Nazi SS when he was just 15-years-old, Rotmensch never saw his parents again.Years later, he learned that his mother died in the gas chambers of the Auschwitz, while his father was shot dead by the Nazis army. His body was never found.His elder brother survived at the camp, but died later died in war in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.Read More: Survivors recall Buchenwald horrorsRotmensch and many others were rescued by the French Army after it marched into Germany."The French controlled the whole train as we were being sent to the execution site. Fortunately, we ran into the French Army and got saved," he said.Praying for his parents and brothers in Hebrew in front of the Monument to the Jewish Victims at the Buchenwald concentration camp, Rotmensch said that Germany had done well reflecting its Nazi history.
A motion for a disaffiliation vote will be submitted Tuesday during a special general assembly.In an interview with le Soleil, the CEGEP student association’s spokesperson Antoine Godin-Landry said that 200 students have signed a petition circulating since March seeking to disaffiliate.Last week, students at Cégep Garneau voted nearly 70 per cent against a strike day to allow its members to attend a protest in Montreal.Following the resignation — and subsequent symbolic firing — of ASSÉ’s executive last weekend, the group reiterated the necessity of continuing their fight against austerity measures, fossil fuels and “political repression.”ASSÉ’s executive was removed after distributing a text proposing a strategic break from striking to better coordinate with labour unions in the fall.
North Sound, Antigua and Barbuda West Indies and England face off in the first Test of a three-match series at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Monday, with both sides involved in reconstruction and rehabilitation following a wretched few months.Facing the wrath of the Indian authorities following an unprecedented abandonment of the tour there last October and with several of their star players either overlooked by the selectors or unwilling to represent the regional team, there is considerable trepidation over the prospects of the West Indies in the opening fixture, notwithstanding the ground's reputation as a batting paradise.Chris Gayle, who led the West Indies to an upset 1-0 triumph the last time England played a Test series in the Caribbean in 2009, announced his unavailability for the assignment, although he is turning out for the Royal Challengers Bangalore in the lucrative Twenty20 Indian Premier League.Dwayne Bravo, captain of the squad who walked out of the Indian campaign, appears to be paying the price for his role in that fiasco, although the official line from the selectors, headed by outstanding former captain Clive Lloyd, is that they are looking to younger players to try to take the team forward.While the West Indies were at least able to qualify from their preliminary group at the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand last month, England failed to advance beyond the group stage, inviting widespread condemnation at home and at the same time fuelling speculation over the possible return of controversial batsman Kevin Pietersen for the Ashes series against arch-rivals Australia in three months' time.One batsman who is expected to make a return in Antigua is Jonathan Trott.Seemingly lost to the game when leaving the last Ashes series in Australia after struggling to cope with the pace of Mitchell Johnson in the first Test in Brisbane, the 33-year-old South African-born player looks set to open the batting in his 50th Test with captain Alastair Cook.Without a century for his country in more than a year-and-a-half, Cook is likely to attract almost forensic attention, both for his leadership and form with the bat, as England embark on an arduous campaign of 17 Tests over a nine-month period.Rustiness will also be a concern as their last Test was more than eight months ago when they completed a 3-1 home series demolition of a dispirited Indian side.Their brief build-up to this series was hardly taxing as the couple of two-day matches against a St Kitts Invitational XI provided such a low standard of opposition that the tourists resorted to using some of their squad players in the home team for the second match.However the game unfolds, England and their army of travelling supporters are anticipating at least one moment of celebration as experienced seam and swing bowler James Anderson needs four wickets in his 100th Test to surpass celebrated all-rounder Ian Botham's tally of 383 – the most by an England cricketer in Tests.Ironically, Anderson and the rest of the England pace attack are being mentored on this tour by fast bowling coach Ottis Gibson, who was surprisingly removed as head coach of the West Indies just a couple of days before the home series against Bangladesh last August.Former hard-hitting West Indies opener Phil Simmons, previously in charge of Ireland, was only announced two weeks ago as Gibson's full-time replacement.Simmons has been preparing the squad at a training camp in Antigua where the continuing good form of Devendra Bishoo looks certain to result in the return of the leg-spinner to the Test fold three years after his last match against Australia in Barbados.Home captain Denesh Ramdin has spoken of relying on spinners to win the series for him, raising the prospect of a final XI including both Bishoo and left-armer Sulieman Benn.That would leave Kemar Roach and Jerome Taylor, the destroyer of England in the decisive first Test in Jamaica in 2009, as the twin spearheads of a bowling attack that will be seeking to exploit and magnify any self-doubt among opponents who inevitably have one eye on their impending home duel with the Australians.
We are far from being done, even though it feels like we are. It is a huge relief and a boost to our morale and sense of accomplishment that the…
Lagos Mainland Rep-elect Jide Jimoh on Sunday blamed poor political education by INEC for the low turnout of voters in Saturday’s Governorship/House of Assembly elections.Jimoh told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) that INEC’s inadequate time for electioneering also contributed to the voter apathy recorded in the poll.“It takes two to tango, the electoral officers must also embark on proper enlightenment, political parties must also intensify their enlightenment and campaign.“Voting is voluntary, you cannot coerce people to go out and vote; someone may have his permanent voter card and decide to keep it at home,’’ he said.The elected legislator added that: “For the fact that people have not come out to vote is not a crime, we just have to encourage people.’’He also stressed the need for government to improve much more on the provision of infrastructure and empowerment so that dividends of democracy will ginger and encourage people to vote.The rep-elect noted that the period of campaign should not be too close, saying that the period for campaign in this country is too short.“In U.S., you have up to three months for campaign before elections; in Nigeria, it is a few weeks you have left to campaign.’’He called for the review of the relevant laws, saying that the number of months for campaign should be increased for future elections.Jimoh, however, commended INEC for improving on its performance in the March 28 elections, noting the conduct of the governorship and state Houses of Assembly election was much better.“I tell you that there are some improvements which I observed in the conduct of this election, compared with the fortnight’s exercise.“For instance, the INEC personnel have improved much more on the use and workings of smart card readers,’’ he said.On the use of the Permanent Voter Cards (PVC) and card readers, Jimoh said it was a welcome development for this country.He urged the electoral commission to retain the use of the card readers in future elections and improve on them.“It has reduced drastically the number of fraudulent activities where in those days you see a local government bring outrageous votes.“The system ensures that voters must be seen and identified physically which made manipulation of figures difficult.’’The rep- elect, who attributed his success to God’s work and the love by the people, urged Nigerians to live up to their responsibilities in the governance of the country.

BBC Sport's football expert Mark Lawrenson is pitting his wits against a different guest each week this season.Lawro's opponent for this weekend's Premier League fixtures is The Vaccines singer Justin Young.Young is a Manchester United fan whose favourite player, David Beckham, influenced him in more ways than one."David Beckham was a great 'hair-spiration' for me as a boy, and an inspiration on and off the field too," he told BBC Sport."Eric Cantona and Peter Schmeichel were my other favourite players but Beckham was my number one."Without a doubt my favourite Beckham haircut was the Brylcreem-era curtains and I still haven't stopped trying to emulate them."A correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth ONE point. Getting the exact score correct earns THREE points.Last weekend, Lawro got five correct results from 10 Premier League games, with one perfect score.His score of seven points was beaten by darts legend Phil 'The Power' Taylor, who also picked five correct results, but with two perfect scores. That gave the 16-time world champion a total of nine points.Lawro also made a prediction for Aston Villa's rearranged game with QPR on Wednesday. He went for a 2-0 Villa win but did not pick up any extra points because the game finished 3-3.We are keeping a record of the totals for Lawro and his guests (below), and showing a table of how the Premier League would look if all of Lawro's predictions were correct (at the bottom of the page).All kick-offs 15:00 BST unless otherwise stated.Manchester United are on a very good run and their fans are suddenly all shouting about how they are going to finish above Manchester City.On current form, it looks like they might be right because United have been playing very well in recent weeks. City, clearly, have not.The biggest problem for the defending champions is that they have been too easy to play against and, therefore, too easy to beat.But this is a huge game for them and I think we will see City's big players like Yaya Toure rise to the occasion. They have done that enough times at Old Trafford in the recent past - City have won on their last three visits.I am expecting a closer encounter this time and I think it is going to end in a draw after an open game.Justin's prediction: David De Gea is perhaps the best keeper in the world on his day. He's one of the main reasons we are where we are. I'm a massive Wayne Rooney fan and I've really enjoyed seeing Ashley Young and Marouane Fellaini come good under Louis van Gaal, because I wasn't their biggest fan before.I think next year will be an important year for us, this season we just need to get in the top four and I think United will win. 4-0Liverpool got themselves over the line and to Wembley after beating Blackburn in their FA Cup quarter-final tie and that success will help their league form too.I can only see one outcome at Anfield on Monday, because Newcastle's poor form means they are the team everyone wants to play right now.Fourth place has gone for Liverpool but their aim now has to be to finish in fifth, get to the FA Cup final and try to win it.Do that, and they have had a good season.* Does not include scores for postponed game - Leicester v Chelsea
Tuen Mun Town Plaza recently caught the eyes of many as radical protesters against parallel trading clashed with mainland visitors and police in the biggest shopping mall in the northwestern New Territories.One popular way for local residents or shoppers from across the border to get to the mall is by taking the light railway to Pui To stop.Many may not know that Pui To is not just the name of a nearby road. During the Southern and Northern Dynasties period, a Buddhist monk named Pui To came to Tuen Mun from India. He is believed to be the first monk to have brought Buddhism here.I'm no expert on Buddhism and this column is not going to focus on the history of this great religion. It's just that few people realise that Pui To is linked to tycoon Li Ka-shing's decision to finance the construction of the just completed Tsz Shan Monastery in Tai Po.While the media reported widely on the private bullet-proof safe house and meditation room for Li, visitors to the Tang dynasty-style temple, which opens to the public on Wednesday, will hopefully find tranquility of nature and soul rather than thinking about the various stories surrounding Li and his intentions in donating HK$1.5 billion for the project.Li initiated the idea more than 10 years ago because he felt there was too much negative sentiment in the city. In the epilogue of a book on the construction of the monastery, Li wrote: "There is a precious pearl deep in everyone's heart. As long as you can find it, your heart will be enlightened. The issue is 'have you found it'?"Walter Ngai Kai-shu, the monastery's secretary general, explained a new way to worship at the facility. Visitors, he said, would be asked to put a bowl of water into a giant vat rather than burning incense as in many other temples. It is said that what Hong Kong now needs is water to cool down the heat in our midst.This seems all very Buddhist, but like it or not, this city certainly needs more cool heads to forge greater tolerance and harmony, as political controversy, social inequality and intensifying Hong Kong-mainland tension take hold.Religion is not supposed to be a cure for everything, but calmness and peace of mind certainly help. Take tourism as an example. Hongkongers started complaining when too many mainland visitors arrived. But over the Easter holidays, when there were fewer mainlanders, the tourism sector bemoaned a loss of business.The question of how Hong Kong can sustain its attraction to mainland spenders while curbing parallel trading is a complicated issue which needs deep reflection not only by the tourism sector and the government, but also the community as a whole.When Pui To first came to Hong Kong more than 1,500 years ago, Tuen Mun was a remote area. He could not have imagined what Hong Kong would look like today and what frustrations and difficulties Hongkongers would face. But the Buddhist theory of karma - that there is a relationship of cause and effect in everything - remains inspiring. Hong Kong's tomorrow is in the hands of our actions today.

I recently visited a ‘head shop’, one of many totally legal establishments now flourishing on British high streets, where users of officially illegal drugs may buy the equipment they need to enjoy their criminal habit.I didn’t buy anything. But one of the items on sale was a wall-clock, especially designed to be used to store drugs. ‘Hide your stash in plain sight!’ said the little poster next to it.It is good advice. If you really want to conceal something, leave it lying about where everyone can see it.This is what the Prime Minister has done with his supposed promise to hold a referendum on British membership of the European Union.The dishonest trick at the heart of the offer is so blazingly obvious that nobody notices it.Let me explain. If Mr Cameron really believed that he would win a parliamentary majority on May 7, he would not make this promise.He loves the EU so much that he has said that he wants to extend it to the Ural mountains. He absolutely does not want this country to leave it.But because Mr Cameron knows perfectly well that he will not win such a majority, and that no possible coalition partner or ally would support such a referendum, he feels safe to make a pledge that will never be redeemed.The purpose of the pledge is to win back some of those voters he and his Blairite friends have long derided as fruitcakes and closet racists. He despises them, but he wants their support to ensure that the Tories are the largest party, and that he stays in office.It would be disastrous for him if they all took him too literally. He needs some of them, but not all of them.This is perhaps why the Tory Party’s campaign is so crude, narrow and awful, almost designed to repel thinking and decent people.The interesting thing about all this is that it is so blatant, yet nobody seems to notice it, just as they don’t notice the perilous state of our economy (another disastrous balance of payments deficit was announced last week).And just as it is obvious that, while we are supposed to have ‘tough’ and ‘draconian’ laws on drugs, shops which help people take drugs thrive all over the country. I sometimes wonder if, one dark and tear-stained morning, all these many lies will be brutally exposed in one dreadful awakening.Winning at any cost? It's the only Game in townWhen I rather guiltily read the books on which the TV series Game Of Thrones is based, I was struck by one thing. The whole point of this saga is that ruthlessness pays, that evil generally wins, that justice is non-existent, and utter cynicism the only wisdom. It is the Middle Ages without the saving grace of Christianity.The whole idea is symbolised by the ghastly Iron Throne for which the various factions and clans compete, and which, once gained, eats into the souls of all who sit on it.I won’t watch the TV version because I very much do not want to see a slick and well-acted portrayal of such foul behaviour. But the success of this drama suggests that this sort of merciless immorality now has a wide and receptive audience. Gleeful, unembarrassed ruthlessness, once rightly kept in check, has become normal among us, and Game Of Thrones is a success because this change is now more or less complete.Political campaigning has played its part in this. I first noticed really dirty tricks in the 1997 campaign, when New Labour screened a particularly vile anti-Tory broadcast personally mocking Tory politicians and conference representatives, and falsely alleging a plan to ‘abolish the old age pension’.Once, this sort of thing was left to underlings and backstairs-crawlers who could be disowned. But now it seems to have become central. The Defence Secretary, Michael Fallon, is a senior Cabinet Minister and an experienced grey head in the Tory Party. I rather like him. But his outburst against Ed Miliband, accusing him of stabbing his brother in the back, and planning to do the same to the country, was a departure from the old rules of gentlemanly combat.It was also inaccurate, as Mr Miliband stabbed his brother in the front, openly campaigning against him in an election – more than can be said for the Tories, who deviously overthrew Iain Duncan Smith in a cruel and personalised putsch.But perhaps the most tricky and ruthless political act of the week came from the Blair creature, who ‘supported’ Mr Miliband on the European issue. How can this ghastly, discredited man not know that his kiss is the kiss of death? Of course he does.Compared with Blair’s embrace, a stab in the back would be an act of kindness.You shouldn't make it upThe story of how the young Princess Elizabeth and her sister Margaret mingled incognito with VE Night revellers is a moving and very British episode.So why must the makers of a new film, claiming to be about the event, fabricate falsehoods about the King’s daughters going to brothels and gambling dens, and Princess Margaret getting drunk?I suppose that having got away with the multiple untruths in The King’s Speech, the movie industry felt that invention was better box office than truth.And yes, I know Shakespeare made things up, too. But this stuff isn’t Shakespeare.The devastating attack no one heardIn a grown-up campaign, last week’s attack on David Cameron by a former British ambassador to Syria would have been devastating. As it is, it seems to have passed almost without notice.Here’s a flavour of the indictment levelled by Peter Ford, Our Man in Damascus from 2003 to 2006.‘If Cameron had his way, the jihadists could have been in control of Damascus by now,’ and, ‘To call for the overthrow of the secular Syrian government, to demonise it out of all proportion… to predict its imminent fall… and then to wail as though it was nothing to do with them when British Muslims set off to help hasten said overthrow is inconsistent and nonsensical.’I couldn’t agree more, and still can’t understand how he gets away with it.Meanwhile, Mr and Mrs Cameron go around the country eating bacon sandwiches and hot dogs with knives and forks to avoid embarrassing photos.
The case of a British woman allegedly murdered by her pastor husband in Ghana took an astonishing twist last week when a court was told that she died of a heroin overdose.Hotel staff found the body of pregnant Charmain Speirs face-down in a bath where it is believed she had been lying for four days.Her husband Eric Isaiah Adusah – a self-proclaimed prophet and evangelical preacher – has been charged with her murder.Local news reports said an autopsy showed the mother of one died of 'opiate heroin overdose'.Mr Adusah's defence lawyer Mr Adomako Acheampong has claimed in court that 41-year-old Ms Speirs was a habitual heroin user – and that her whole family were addicted to the drug.But speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday, Ms Speirs's brother Paul said that his sister had never touched drugs and it was 'an outrageous lie' to say his family were all addicts.He added: 'The defence lawyer seems to be suggesting she had been a heroin addict for years but that's absolute rubbish.'The gardener, 30, admitted that he had battled heroin addiction – but said it had been Ms Speirs who ensured he sought help at a Christian-run rehabilitation centre near Glasgow. He insisted he had now been drug-free for ten years.He also said his sister, who had an eight-year-old son from a previous relationship, would not have taken any such substances of her own accord, adding: 'My sister was always against drugs.'And he rejected the claim that his entire family, including parents Peter, 63, a self-employed plumber, and 61-year-old cleaner Linda, were addicted to drugs, saying: 'My parents can't stand the things.'He revealed that Charmain's family had been surprised at her 'whirlwind marriage' to Mr Adusah last September and had never trusted him.And he said that her friends had noticed changes in Ms Speirs after she met and then married 28-year-old Mr Adusah, who was based in Britain but is originally from Ghana.Ms Speirs grew up in Arbroath in the Angus region of Scotland before moving to Swansea, where she studied photojournalism and then worked as a radiography assistant for the NHS.Last year she married Mr Adusah, leader of the Global Light Revival Ministries church based in Tottenham, North London. He has been active as a preacher in Britain since 2010. The couple travelled to Ghana early last month so Mr Adusah could preach at a three-day religious rally.On March 16 after the rally the couple checked in to the upmarket Mac-Dic Royal Plaza Hotel in Koforidua for five days.But when Mr Adusah left at dawn on their second day, he reportedly told reception staff not to disturb his wife as she was 'fasting and praying', and left a Do Not Disturb notice on the door. Hotel managers became concerned when Ms Speirs would not respond when they knocked.On March 20, porters used a spare key to gain access and made the grim discovery.Now her family are desperately seeking answers as they try to piece together fragments of information.Mr Speirs said: 'We've been left in the cold, we don't know a thing. My mum and dad just want to get Charmain's body back home.' A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said: 'We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.'Mr Adusah has been charged with murder in Ghana and has had his application for bail rejected. He has not yet entered a plea. The case has been adjourned until later this month.
A leading member of the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange, which campaigned to legalise child sex in the 1970s and 80s, has joined the supporters of the media pressure group Hacked Off.Tom O’Carroll, a former Open University information officer and formerly a key activist for PIE, attended a Hacked Off rally in the Houses of Parliament on February 25 to lobby MPs for state involvement in media regulation.The organisation, set up in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal, is campaigning against what it sees as the ‘biased and unfair’ Independent Press Standards Organisation.It wants MPs to set up a statutory body to regulate the press, as recommended by the Leveson Inquiry.The news that O’Carroll is a backer of Hacked Off will be an embarrassment to the group.PIE was formed in 1974 to campaign for sex with children to be legalised and formed an alliance with the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL).The NCCL lobbied parliament for the age of sexual consent to be cut to ten as long as the child 'understood the nature of the act' and apparently consented.The group also wanted incest to be legalised.O'Carroll was on the NCCL's gay rights sub-committee. The 69-year-old was jailed in 1981 for ‘corrupting public morals’.He wrote a blog after the February meeting, chaired by comedian John Cleese, confirming his attendance.A Hacked Off spokesman said that the meeting was ‘open to and free for all members of the public to attend’.

A seven-year-old British boy has fallen 160ft to his death from a cliff in the Alps after becoming separated from his family on a skiing holiday.Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source.The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place.Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family.Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine.One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts.His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search.At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis.He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff.The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body.Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way.Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him.'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started.'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis.'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.'He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old.'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell.'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.'Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family.'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon.'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it.'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.'Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk.The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages.David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014.On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'.Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad – they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named.They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.'Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.'An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before.'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'
The 52-year-old has replaced Great British Bake Off host Sue Perkins as most likely to take on the role, according to bookies. Philip is best known for starring as the rough-and-ready DCI Gene Hunt, the politically-incorrect detective from the BBC police drama. Odds have been slashed from 10-1 to 2-1 after The Sun on Sunday reported that the BBC are considering hiring the actor-turned-presenter. The BBC declined to comment on the speculation.Philip is a vocal car enthusiast and is about to present the second series of For The Love Of Cars on Channel Four David Williams of Ladbrokes said: "All of a sudden Glenister is the hottest name around. "We hadn't seen a penny for him before the weekend but in next to no time he's the new favourite. Punters seem convinced that something is afoot." Simon Clare, spokesman for Coral, said they have slashed their bets from 10/1 to 2/1 for Glenister. "We have seen a host of celebrities gambled on in recent weeks to take over from Clarkson and it is rapidly becoming one of the biggest novelty betting events ever", he said.Behind Philip, Great British Bake Off star Sue Perkins is the next favourite at 4-1 followed by Dermot O'Leary who has recently quit X Factor at 5-1. Jeremy was the subject of an internal BBC investigation after he attacked Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon, splitting his lip and verbally abusing him in a 30-second assault on March 4. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 before it announced his contract would not be renewed. Last week, the disgraced 55-year-old pulled out of his planned appearance hosting BBC satirical show Have I Got News For You. The future of the show's other two presenters – Richard Hammond and James May – is also unclear, with both men's Top Gear contracts having run out.
MOTORISTS heading to and from the city centre have been caught up in large traffic jams today as work continues on new road crossings at one of Hull's busiest junctions.Drivers faced delays with queues stretching along Beverley Road, Spring Bank and Ferensway as a road improvement scheme entered its final phase.One motorist told the Mail how a journey from Mytongate to Beverley Road took half an hour this morning when it normally takes five minutes.Improvements to the junction linking Beverley Road and Ferensway with Spring Bank and Freetown Way started on January 19 and the 12-week project is scheduled for completion this month.However, with contractors avoiding work at the site during peak morning and evening rush-hour times, more work has to be done over the weekend.Another driver, Ian Shenton, 49, told how he was caught up in traffic jams in Beverley Road as he attempted to reach East Park."It took me a good 20 minutes to finally get through the lights," said Mr Shenton, of east Hull. "I can understand them wanting to do as much as they can over the weekend when it's less busy but I think everyone will be glad when the road works are finished."On Saturday, bus company EYMS diverted buses away from Beverley Road to Princes Avenue to avoid the tailbacks.The road works have included larger traffic islands for pedestrians wishing to cross the junction, the installation of new wheelchair-friendly crossing points and new paving for people with sight problems.The 20-year-old traffic signals and underground electrical equipment have been renewed with repairs to the surfaces of the main approach roads.

Lovebirds Ian and Susan Goodwin on board their houseboat, SpadgerWidowed boaters Sue Boyce and Ian Goodwin had given up on finding love after losing their partners to illness.But romance blossomed for the couple after Ian told a pal: “What I really need is a bereaved boater.”The pair both got together when they met on the waterway in Llangollen – famous for the nearby Pontcysyllte Aqueduct.“Lots of my friends knew lots of Ian’s friends but we did not know each other,” Sue said.“For some reason, we had never met. I was talking to a friend of mine in my local pub and he said it was really difficult dating when you got older.“Ian had lost his wife and lived on a narrow boat, a life most people do not understand and he said to my friend ‘What I could do with is a bereaved boater,’” Sue said.“And I walked past. My friend waved me in and introduced us.”The pair married in St Collen’s Church, Llangollen, last month.10 things to see and do around LlangollenThey were racing against the clock to marry in the town as canal rules meant they had to leave by April 1.Sue wore a green dress while Ian was dapper in a charcoal grey suit.She fell for the retired computer programmer because he is “very patient and he’s good fun”.“We both thought we had found our soulmates and then we lost them,” the 57-year-old said.“The older you get the more difficult relationships are. It’s more difficult to gel.”Ian and Sue became friends before they fell in love.45 lakes, rivers and canals that make Wales look like heaven on earth“We did some boating together and got to know each other,” Sue said.Ian proposed on December 27 while they were watching a band called Roving Crows in Llangollen’s Sun Inn. The vicar who married them was pulling pints that night.“They have a song called ‘Woman After My Own Heart,’” Sue said.“In that there is a line that says ‘Sail away with me.’ Ian stood on the stage and said ‘Sail away and marry me.’”“Everyone in the room knew what was going to happen apart from me,” Sue said.The group announced to cheers: “If anyone missed that, Ian just proposed!”“A moment or two later I said, ‘Yes!’” Sue said.Marriage was not always on the cards for the lovebirds, who now live together on Ian’s boat, Spadger.“At first, she didn’t want to know me,” Ian said. “But after a while, she accepted my presence. I think she was just playing hard to get. That’s my take on it.”“That was in separate boats,” Ian said. “Half-way around she abandoned her boat and got on mine. The rest is history.”The dad-of-three and stepdad-of-four never thought he would find love again after losing his wife, Penny.“I had given up really,” the 63-year-old said.“I thought ‘I’m not going to find a boater.’“And then a mutual friend said, ‘Well, we know someone, it’s Sue.’“Two minutes later she came into the pub. It was like destiny.”Neither expects the other to forget their late partners.“Sue was engaged to be married and her chap sadly passed away after a massive heart attack,” Liverpool-born Ian said.“I lost my wife to pancreatic cancer. Neither of us will forget our late partners. That is a good thing and we both understand it. And with us both being boaters, it is a lot for us to have in common.”
Panama City: Hillary Clinton would be an "excellent president", US President Barack Obama said on Saturday, a day before his former secretary of state is expected to announce her campaign for the White House in 2016."She was a formidable candidate in 2008, she was a great supporter of mine in the general election, she was an outstanding secretary of state, she is my friend. I think she would be an excellent president," Mr Obama said during a news conference at the Americas summit in Panama City.Mr Obama said when Mrs Clinton makes her bid public, he expects "she will be very clear about her vision for the country moving forward".He lauded her foreign policy as the top US diplomat during his first term in office."She's going to be able to handle herself really well in any conversations that take place around foreign policy," he said, adding: "her track record with respect to domestic policy is, I think, one that cares about working families."Mrs Clinton plans to announce her long-anticipated plans through video and social media on Sunday before travelling to key early voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire, according to a Democrat close to the Clinton camp.Mr Obama, asked about the possibility of US Vice-President Joe Biden running to succeed him, demurred."Not only have I run in my last election, I am not in the business of prognosticating future elections," he said.
Leader of the defunct Niger Delta Vigilante (NDV), Chief Ateke Tom, has said former militant leaders in the region are ready to cooperate and work with the President-Elect, General Muhammadu Buhari.Ateke, who disclosed this while speaking to newsmen at Okochiri community in Okrika local government area of Rivers State, urged Buhari to invite leaders of genuine militant camps in the Niger Delta region to discuss on how to move the region forward.He said, “I am here to congratulate Buhari for his victory. We will want good leadership; we thank God that Buhari is now our President and we pray God Almighty to give him wisdom to rule our country. Since Buhari is now our President, we want him to meet with the core leaders of the Niger Delta struggle; I mean the real leaders in the struggle.“He should call the real leaders and talk to them. Let us discuss on our needs. He should also not forget the Amnesty Programme, because we know what we fought for and that was why they gave us Amnesty. We did not get the Amnesty Programme from the backyard. So, let him keep to the programme. Let the Amnesty Programme function well and we will like it. We are ready to work with Buhari.”The former militant leader said none of the former agitators in the region will go back to the creeks or blow up pipelines as threatened by some activists in the region recently, due to the defeat of President Goodluck Jonathan in the just concluded Presidential election in the country.Ateke said, “Some people are saying they want to go back to the creek, or they want to blow up pipelines; no, I, Ateke Tom will not be part of that, we don’t need all those things and nobody will go back to the creeks. I have a say in the Niger Delta and I am one of the top fighters; so nobody will go back to the creeks. I advice the youths not to follow anybody back to the creeks.“We should not say because there is change of government and Buhari is now the President, and somebody wants to go back to the creeks; what are you going there to do? So, let nobody follow anybody to the creeks. What we want is that let Buhari meet us and treat us well.“We cannot say because Jonathan, our brother is the President and therefore under his administration, every programme and policies that were mapped out for the Niger Delta by Yar’adua before his death, have all been implemented by the Jonathan government; no. There are some of the programmes and policies that have not been implemented, and we expect Buhari to implement them when he finally takes over as President.”
Too often matters have been discussed behind closed doors. Too often in its recent past the council has chosen secrecy over openness and accountability.Earlier this year, we revealed almost one in five of the council’s decisions in 2014 were made behind closed doors.As part of the Mercury and Sunday Tasmanian’s Your Right to Know campaign, state political editor Matt Smith requested, through Right to Information legislation, the details of expense claims for Hobart’s elected members.MORE: WHY THIS PLACE IS A MONEY PITThe outcomes ran as a special investigation in yesterday’s Sunday Tasmanian and continue today.They revealed aldermen had claimed a total of $135,000 in personal expenses since 2012.We must be clear: there is no suggestion elected members have done anything illegal or in breach of council guidelines. But the investigation has raised significant questions about these very guidelines and the subsequent processes and accountability.Many of the claims had no explanation of why they were needed. Several did not have accompanying work receipts.The documents provided to this newspaper did not include expenses incurred by aldermen which are paid for directly by the council or on other corporate credit cards.We argue that the very fact journalists were forced to use RTI legislation to access what should be basic details of council spending is absurd.At the end of the day, we are talking about ratepayers’ money. Your money.The council now has a new regime and the opportunity to break down the barriers of the past. To set a fresh course. New Lord Mayor Sue Hickey has spoken about the need for greater transparency.Arguably her biggest opponent on the council, Marti Zucco, has said the same thing. There is clearly an acknowledgment there is a problem and a mood for change.In the wake of the investigation, Ald Hickey has called for a review of the council expenses process which has been started by general manager Nick Heath.This will look closely at the process which Mr Heath describes as one of “self-certification”, whereby elected members are not required to obtain council approval before making purchases and receipts are “not required but are often provided and obvious discrepancies are queried”.He has discussed the matter with the Auditor-General.Tonight the council will vote on several motions to open up its processes, including public reporting of elected members’ expenses and monthly publication of these details on the council’s website.This comes in the wake of a council motion earlier this year to suspend its policy on financial assistance for developers — following the Myer fiasco — while it works on a more transparent way to deal with investors; and demand that local government candidates across the state disclose campaign donations.The council is starting to say the right things about opening up. But the Your Right to Know investigation highlights one undeniable point: the time for talk is over.
“The abuse she has suffered left her mentally and physically traumatised,” Canadian-based aid worker Yousif Daoud, who recently returned from the region, told The Toronto Star.“This girl is so young she could die if she delivers a baby. Even caesarean section is dangerous.”The girl, a member of the persecuted Yazidi Christian minority, has been flown out of Iraq by a Kurdish aid agency and is receiving treatment in Germany.Daoud said the girl was found in “very bad shape”.“She was sexually abused by no fewer than 10 men. Most of them were frontline fighters or suicide bombers who are given girls as a reward,” he said.ISIS released more than 200 Yazidis on Wednesday, mostly women and children, after holding them captive for eight months.Daoud said ISIS released the abused women and girls “to shame the whole community”. He said the victims faced the humiliation of lost chastity.The news comes as IS militants are holding hostage at least 50 civilians, almost half of them women, seized in a raid on a village in central Syria.They were kidnapped from the village of Mabujeh in Hama province on March 31, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.News of the kidnappings had been kept quiet because of ongoing negotiations for their release, but the talks have since faltered, said Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman.Ten of those taken, including six women, are Ismailis, a minority sect that is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. The remaining 40 are Sunni Muslims, including at least 15 women.“There are fears that the women are being taken as slaves,” Abdel Rahman told AFP.He said the Ismailis were kidnapped because IS considers them “infidels,” and that the Sunnis — although from the same sect as IS fighters — were taken because IS viewed them as “loyal to the Ismailis”.Mabujeh, east of the provincial capital Hama, has a population of Sunnis, Ismailis and Alawites, another offshoot of Shiite Islam that is the sect of President Bashar al-Assad and his clan.
Kevin Pietersen announced himself with a century – what else? - on the first day of the rest of his life at The Parks.England's celebrity Test discard had not reached three figures in any form of cricket since he saved the follow-on against Australia at Old Trafford in August 2013.But he made shelling peas and pinching sweets off kids in the playground look like hard labour as he cruised to a 110-ball hundred against Oxford University as he launched his bid for a fairytale Ashes encore this summer.And on the eve of England's first Test against the West Indies in Antigua, he could not have chosen a better time to flex his muscles and let the selectors know he is still around.Pietersen's last appearance in whites, against a red ball, was in January last year as England curled up their toes inside three days in Sydney, the final act of a 5-0 whitewash for which he was cast as scapegoat.But he pulled in the crowds and took to challenging early-season conditions like a duck to orange sauce as he rescued Surrey from their stumble to 78-4 against the students.Scapegoat: Pietersen was made one of the scapegoats for the Ashes whitewashGive or take posh twits jumping off Magdalen Bridge on May Day, Pietersen's return to action attracted the biggest crowd at Oxford University this year.Circumspect at first, KP eased through the gears without crunching the clutch once. The only time he was caught with his trousers down was to replace his thigh pad.Coming in at 31-2 in the 10th over, after business management studies undergraduate Sam Weller had removed both openers, Pietersen's march to the crease was greeted by ripples of warm applause.On a ground where he scored 62 for Notinghamshire in an early-season warm-up 11 years ago, he took eight balls to get off the mark.Determined: Pietersen with coach Graham Ford in the nets before the gameAnd thrill-seekers had to wait 45 minutes for KP to hoist off-spinner Jack McIver to the ropes at long-off for the first of his 14 boundaries.But once he had had whipped left-arm seamer Jack Grundy through midwicket with his signature flamingo stroke, it was like rolling back the plaudits to an age before Textgate and incendiary autobiographies.Once he had reached his half-century off 63 balls, Pietersen's innings became increasingly agricultural, twice clearing the keeper and slips with premeditated mows intended for cow corner.But there were also snapshots of his thrilling power, one cover drive knocking an elderly spectator off his fishing chair. There are probably hanging judges who would haul KP up before the beak at Lord's for less.One of the first players on the ground, shortly after 9am, Pietersen – as ever – was instantly recognisable.While the rest of his team-mates warmed up in regulation black training gear, KP added a cable-knit sleeveless sweater and woollen beanie hat.And at the crease, the luminous green stickers on his bat, and fluorescent orange flashes on the heels of his boots, could have brought a jumbo jet in to land on a foggy night.Before tea, with Surrey recovering on 220-5, it was not the first time he would stand out from the crowd.
But at least three other Tasmanian towns have water that cannot be consumed because of heavy metal contamination.The extent of lead contamination in some North-East areas will be revealed at a public meeting on April 21 at Pioneer — one of five towns on a “Do Not Consume” alert.Macquarie University professor Mark Taylor and researcher Paul Harvey will attend the meeting to detail results of a study to be published in the Environmental Science and Pollution Research journal.The results will relate to tap water, natural water and infrastructure in the Pioneer, Ringarooma and Gladstone areas.At Winnaleah, TasWater is working with the Department of Health and Human Services to determine whether a filtration system could provide fully treated water.The trial centres on a mobile nanofiltration membrane plant, a Tasmanian first, TasWater works delivery general manager Dr Dharma Dharmabalan said.“Much of the community has been unhappy with the taste and appearance of the previous alternative water supply, and following community consultation, and with the guidance from the [DHHS], in November 2014 we reinstated the bore system with a ‘Do Not Consume’ alert.”There are 27 towns with Boil Water or Do Not Consume alerts.“By 2018, we expect to have addressed water quality in 19 of these towns, with the remaining to follow,” Dr Dharmabalan said.At Pioneer, resident Jenny Bellinger said rainwater tanks were being installed but that process had been too slow.“We asked for an alternative source of water that was lead-free,” Ms Bellinger said.“What we’ve been trying to do ... is to get TasWater to come back to our hall to talk to us because most of us didn’t want tanks, we wanted an alternative water supply.”TasWater said it was regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services across all its drinking water systems.It did thousands of water quality tests across the state each year.
Mystery surrounds the sensational CCTV footage showing the gem thieves in the middle of their audacious £60million heist after it was suggested that the police had missed this crucial evidence.The Daily Mirror published sensational pictures of the Hatton Garden raiders 21 hours before Scotland Yard released them in a bid to appeal for information about identities of the thieves.The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted', according to a report today in its sister title The Sunday Mirror, with an apparent source saying it 'blows the case wide open'.But yesterday afternoon detectives insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'.This is in stark contrast with the response given to MailOnline hours before, when police refused to say whether they had the footage.The Met finally released the pictures late on Saturday afternoon, while The Mirror could sell the images to a number of other national titles, including this website.Up until that point, no other newspaper was able to help the police trace the culprits of what could be the biggest ever robbery in Britain.It raises questions about why the police chose to keep them to themselves - or whether they even had the footage.Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme this morning, former Flying Squad chief John O'Connor said: 'I've never heard of anything like this.'I'm not blaming The Mirror, but I am pointing some quite accusing fingers at the police for not finding it themselves.'It is likely to put further pressure on an investigation which has already been accused of a number of failings.Owners of the security deposit boxes are continuing to demand answers on why police failed to respond to the alarm when it first went off over the long weekend.And now the MailOnline has revealed some have resorted to bribing security guards, as they desperately try to find out information about what has been lost.The CCTV will have gone some way to answering questions for those who lost thousands of pounds in the theft.It reveals how the raiders entered the building by a side door on Thursday evening, minutes after staff left the premises.They then entered the basement through the lift shaft, and broke through the shutters before spending hours in the vault - emerging the next morning carrying the gems out the building in a wheelie bin.They then returned on Saturday night, apparently repeating the process throughout the night, leaving early on the morning of Easter Sunday.The burglary was discovered on Tuesday morning.Police have now said 72 out of the vaults 999 boxes were opened.
The Department of Health and Human Services buys more than 500,000 eggs a year, the prison service more than 70,000. Soon after winning government last year, Treasurer Peter Gutwein committed to overturn the “ridiculous” rule to buy non-cage eggs.“Under Labor, local businesses couldn’t get a look in,” a government spokesman said.“We said then it wasn’t good enough and that’s why shortly after coming to office we overturned Labor and the Greens’ ridiculous free-range egg regulations, which locked out Tasmanian businesses.”The Department of Health said Tasmanian Health Organisations north and south and Custodial Youth Justice have contracts for cage eggs with Pure Foods, which provides about 477,000 Tasmanian­-produced eggs a year.THO-North West had a contract for caged eggs with PFD Food Services, a Tasmanian company that sources its eggs from Queensland.“To ensure value for money and compliance with the buy local policy, the TPS purchases local eggs at the best price it can obtain, which is usually cage eggs,” a spokeswoman said.“The TPS requests that all eggs supplied are from Tasmanian sources, however, any eggs that we order for which there is an insufficient Tasmanian supply, are supplied from Victorian sources.”RSPCA Tasmania said the move was disappointing.“We understand the economic reality the government faces, however it sends a mixed message,” general manager Peter West said.The former government gave grants to Tasmanian producers to step up their cage-free production.Greens consumer affairs spokesman Nick McKim said the previous policy showed leadership by encouraging appropriate animal welfare standards.“By changing the policy, the Liberals have endorsed animal cruelty and a lowest common denominator approach to purchasing policy,” Mr McKim said.
Aaron Leeson-Woolley should have been wearing a tux and getting ready to watch his partner of five years walk down the aisle on Saturday.Instead, he wore yellow and sat in the middle of a Riverina park as he cried and hugged the hundreds of people who knew and loved his fiancee, Stephanie Scott.The body of the popular school teacher was recovered from bushland north of Griffith on Friday, five days after she was allegedly killed by cleaner Vincent Stanford.Ms Scott's parents, brothers and sisters joined the whole town of Leeton at a memorial picnic to honour their daughter and sister.Her father, Bob, told the crowd of hundreds gathered in Mountford Park that he wanted his daughter to be remembered for the great girl she was – and not the tragic way she was taken away."Stephanie was a bubbly, bright, witty, intelligent fun-loving girl who has obviously impacted on many people here today and our wishes for the future are that she will continue in your minds. I'm sure wherever she is now that she would wish that to be the case as you remember her as that great little girl she was."Moments after the moving tribute, Ms Scott's fiance rested his head against his bride-to-be's mother, Merrilyn Scott."He's doing it a bit tougher than most, as you can imagine," said Mr Scott.Ms Scott's father said the family had been moved by women in the small Riverina town who had hung their wedding dresses on their doors as a tribute to the bride-to-be. Within hours the tribute had spread around the country as brides from Brisbane to Melbourne joined in on the symbolic gesture."She was to be married today and some of the people in town have taken out their wedding dresses and hung them on their front doors, which is a great tribute to her."After the emotional speech, Ms Scott's fiance and her family walked into the middle of the Sunday park and let dozens of yellow balloons drift into the air as people clapped and cried.Police, firefighters and volunteers who have spent the past week searching for Ms Scott have also rallied around the family.The police officer who helped find Ms Scott's body knelt down before her fiance and offered his condolences in the park.Griffith police commander Detective Superintendent Michael Rowan appeared shaken by the killing that has rocked the small community.Only hours earlier, he had spoken of how police trail bike riders discovered Ms Scott's burnt remains in Cocoparra National Park, where her alleged killer regularly camped.On Saturday morning, Stephanie's sister Kim shared a wedding poem which described the deep bond Ms Scott and her fiance shared. She had intended to read it at the couples reception which, until the tragic events of this week, was due to take place that afternoon."We couldn't be happier, it's a dream come true," she wrote. "To watch your sister find happiness and to say I do."Kim Scott recalled how her little sister and Mr Leeson-Woolley met in their hometown of Canowindra growing up. "They shared car journeys," she wrote. "Along with Dad, Stuie and me."They make each other smile, they can fill a room with love.""Joking and laughing, they fit each other like a glove. I wish you all the happiness, for the many years to come."As the family shared memories of the bright and bubbly teacher and thought of the wedding that never was, her remains were being taken to Glebe Morgue in Sydney, where an autopsy will be carried out this week.
KITCHENER — Danielle Wellerdt and Mark Doherty first met in a boxing ring. So it was only fitting the boxing enthusiasts faced off in the same ring for their first fight as husband and wife."We wanted to start our marriage in this boxing ring," Danielle, 22, said. "And we don't dance."The couple remembered their first encounter fondly. It was three years ago and Mark was Danielle's first sparring partner in the ring.She knew right then he was a knockout."I elbowed him in the face in the first 33 seconds of the fight," she said.Mark, 27, laughed and added, "Yeah, it was fun, it was a good time."The newlyweds from Cambridge stripped out of their wedding attire early Saturday afternoon and donned gym gear, mouthguards and boxing gloves.These two weren't interested in a first dance at their wedding reception — they wanted a first fight, instead.Exercise equipment was pushed aside to make room for tables, food and decorations at SydFit Health Centre, the boxing gym where they first met.About 60 friends and family members swarmed the gym in fine suits and elegant dresses.Close friends said they weren't at all surprised when Danielle and Mark said they wanted to start their marriage with a sweaty, adrenaline-pumping boxing match instead of the traditional slow dance."She is a bit outrageous and it's always a bit of an adventure," said Colin Sarkany, a friend of Danielle's for over 10 years and a groomsman. "It's going to be a real fight."Felicia Johnston, one of her bridesmaids, piped in and said: "I know she will not hold back."Mark and Danielle love a good fight. For their first Valentine's Day date, the couple went to the Hershey Centre in Mississauga to watch a live professional boxing match.They are both boxing enthusiasts and Danielle is a trainer at Syd Vanderpool's gym.With fists in the air Mark "The Destroyer" and Danielle "The Grenade Launcher" smiled at each other from opposite ends of the boxing ring.Even though she couldn't stop giggling, Danielle packed a few good, hard punches at her new husband.Mark grinned from ear to ear just giddy with joy. Three rounds later Vanderpool declared Danielle the winner.The newlyweds hugged, out of breath, while their friends and family cheered them on. It was just how they wanted it to be.Vanderpool's words of advice: "You always have to remember to fight for your marriage."Now it was time for them to get out of sweaty clothes and off to their honeymoon in cottage country.
Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel are parents of a baby boy, according to a report out Saturday.The couple's first son is named Silas Randall Timberlake, reps for the two told People in confirming the birth.Beyond the name, details are reportedly being kept private for now, in line with the couple's approach to confirming the pregnancy in the first place. While word that a baby was on the way bubbled up in November and seemed to be confirmed by former N'Sync bandmate Joey Fatone in December, the new parents didn't go public until the end of January."Thank you EVERYONE for the Bday wishes!," Timberlake said on Instagram on his 34th birthday. "This year, I'm getting the GREATEST GIFT EVER. CAN'T WAIT. #BoyOrGirl #YouNeverKnow #WeDontEvenKnow #WeAreTakingBets."The couple marked Biel's birthday in March with a low-key dinner party with friends, after he wished her well via Instagram and called her "the sweetest, most GORGEOUS, goofiest, most BAD-ASS chick I know."Dad and son now share a middle name, Randall.Biel, 33, and the "Suit and Tie" singer got engaged in early 2012 and tied the knot later that year.Follow Christie D'Zurilla on Twitter @theCDZ and Google+.

It's a sport with a truly global reach as these images of children, amateurs and professional stars playing cricket show.The stunning shots make up the short-list for the Wisden–MCC Cricket Photograph of the Year 2014, which was won by Getty Images photographer Matthew Lewis.His image of Dwayne Bravo shows the player taking a breathtaking full-length catch for the West Indies to dismiss Australia’s James Faulkner during last year’s ICC World Twenty20 competition in Bangladesh.But portraits of ordinary players also make the list, from children on a Bangladesh rubbish tip to a club player attempting a catch in Kent.

Christopher Pyne counts calories. Obsessively. The federal Education Minister admits his use of the diet tracking application MyFitnessPal verges on an addiction.Since last February, Pyne has entered everything he eats, and any exercise he does, into the app. At the end of each day he checks whether he has stayed within 1250 calories – an ambitious target given dieticians recommend the average male consume around 2200 calories a day.Pyne dropped from 83 to 73 kilograms last year – an achievement he attributes to hourly morning walks, skipping snacks and avoiding breakfast (he opts for only black tea or coffee).He is among a large group of MPs who are growing ever-mindful of their food intake, and the exercise they do. As Deputy Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce remarked in a speech to Parliament last year: "From my observation, two things happen to you in this building: you gain weight and you lose touch."The challenges politicians face in staying healthy will be familiar to many Australians. Long, unpredictable working hours. Easy access to unhealthy food. Hours spent sitting down. It's a lifestyle that makes exercise virtually essential to keeping the bulge at bay.The Education Minister's regime is certainly a far cry from when he entered politics in 1993. Pyne was aged 25, and put on a 6.3 kilograms in his first year. There were no direct flights from his Adelaide electorate to Canberra so he had to fly via Melbourne. Cooked breakfasts would be served on both flights and he would eat on both."It's very easy in politics to put on weight; you're constantly being fed," he says. "There are very few functions where food isn't included – spring rolls, party pies, it's very calorific."At the start of each term of Parliament, an initiation session is held for newly-elected politicians. One of the key messages is: take care of your fitness."You are told that some MPs will put on 10kg in first term," says Labor MP Ed Husic, who entered Parliament in 2010.  "You have to be mindful of all your lifestyle choices because you see people literally growing in front of your eyes." Prime Minister Tony Abbott, of course, is a famous athlete – participating in 14-hour iron-man events, volunteer fire fighting and racing in the annual pollie pedal charity bike race. After winning government, he had a treadmill installed in his office so he could exercise during bad weather.Treasurer Joe Hockey, who had gastric bypass surgery in 2012, is regularly seen playing squash at the Parliament House gym in the early morning. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop jogs for 6 kilometres each morning on overseas trips.Bishop's predecessor, Bob Carr, generated guffaws around the country last year by writing of his passion for steel-cut oats, the "wonderful one-legged Romanian deadlift" and his desire to achieve "a concave abdomen defined by deep-cut obliques".John Howard was famous for his brisk early morning walks and John Hewson became known as Amphetamine Man for his long dawn runs while opposition leader.During the 1993 election, Hewson would schedule press conferences at the end, and sometimes the start, of his runs – a habit that infuriated the travelling press pack. One morning in Hobart the photographers hinted at their displeasure by showing up in their pyjamas and bathrobes.Paul Keating took to bouncing on a trampoline, an activity he believed would clean out the arteries and, one biographer claimed, even ward off cancer.But Ed Husic says there's no doubt today's politicians are paying increasing attention to diet and exercise."There's a growing belief that you can't perform at your best if you're not looking after yourself," says Husic, a passionate basketballer.Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen has seen the benefits first hand. Like many men, Bowen says he was fit in his youth but let himself go in his 30s. When he turned 40 two years ago he decided to take action.He has since lost 17 kilograms by avoiding dessert, eating fewer carbohydrates and doing 45 minutes of weights and cardio each morning."I feel fitter and more energetic than I ever have," he says. "I used to get pretty tired and I just put that down to the job and the demands. Now I realise that I was going around with an extra load."One of Parliament's larger politicians, Liberal National Party member Ewan Jones, says being overweight can hold back a politician's career."People look at you and think you're lazy, that you can't do the job," says Jones, who hovers between 120 and 150 kilograms. "You only get one chance to make a first impression."Jones has recently tried the intermittent (5:2) fasting diet in which you eat normally for five days a week and fast on the other two – a current favourite among many politicians. He admits it has been a struggle: "It's very hard when someone walks past you with a rice-paper roll," he says.A commitment to fitness carries risks as well as rewards, as some politicians have discovered. In 1990, speaker Leo McLeay broke his arm and suffered facial injuries when a bike he had rented from Parliament House collapsed underneath him. He later won $65,000 in compensation. Today's elected representatives keen to cruise around Capital Hill must now provide their own set of wheels.
The US Capitol Building has been placed on lockdownOne federal official told NBC News that there were "no indications at this point of terrorism".Police were also investigating a suspicious package close to the complex, which was later reported to be the suspected shooter's suitcase.There are no indications at this point of terrorismAccording to several Twitter users, the person who was shot was a protester.Some described the individual as holding a placard which read: "Tax the 1 per cent."The building was placed on lockdown on Saturday as a precautionary measure, with no one being allowed to enter or exit the area.Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement: "The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit."She added shortly afterwards: "Confirmed: self-inflicted gunshot by neutralized subject."Few lawmakers are currently in the area as Congress is out of session this week.
Hollywood icon Raquel Welch has spoken of how she launched a furious attack on her father as a child after snapping over his cruel behaviour.The actress said she was “terrified” of Armando, who once held her head under a faucet and made her cut her hair off.She finally flipped at 16 when she saw him throw milk over mum Josephine after complaining about her cooking – screaming out and flying at him with a poker.Raquel said: “I think my mum rather liked it but he was shocked.“He didn’t treat my mother very nicely. I picked up the poker at the fireplace and came at him and said, ‘Don’t you ever do that to mother again or I’ll…’“He was stunned. I had never thought about confronting my father like that, it was just an instinct.“I thought it was cruel, demeaning and totally uncalled for. She was phenomenal, she was a wonderful woman.“I didn’t like the way that you could be with a man and he could treat you so badly and he’s your husband.”Innocent: Raquel was "just a kid in pigtails"The 74-year-old, who sent pulses racing in her fur-kini in 1966’s One Million Years BC, was also berated by her dad for paying attention to her looks.She revealed that when she started junior high school at 13 she got her braids cut into a shorter style “with curls and all pretty and girly”. But Armando, an aeronautical engineer from Bolivia, was livid.Speaking on Piers Morgan’s ITV show Life Stories, Raquel said: “My father was a tough customer. He was very strict, I was terrified of him and there were times I disliked him.“When I came home with that haircut, he ran my head under the faucet. He didn’t like it. He said ‘Cut it, you’re not having curls like that!’ So I had very short hair."He didn’t want me to be too girly, I think he didn’t want me to get involved with boys too early. I just hated that he was clipping my wings.“But at the same time I had enormous respect for him and I did want to please him.”Glamorous: The actress became an iconRaquel was born Jo Raquel Tejada in Chicago in 1940 and dad Armando Carlos Tejada Urquizo hailed from La Paz while mum Josephine Sarah was from the US.The star married childhood sweetheart James Welch at 18 after becoming pregnant and they had children Damon, now 55, and Latanne, 53, before splitting after four years.She married producer Patrick Curtis in 1966 and divorced him in 1972, then in 1980 began a 10-year marriage with producer and director André Weinfeld.She wed fourth husband Richard Palmer in 1999 but they separated in 2008 – and she has said she does not intend to marry again.Speaking about life in Beverly Hills at 74, Raquel said: “Being seen as a sex symbol and getting older, you know, it does make you very self-conscious.“Fortunately, because of my dancing background I was very disciplined about physical fitness. I also bumped into yoga when I was 40. What people don’t realise is it’s not just a crazy exercise where you get into odd poses, it’s very scientifically designed.”
WHETHER you want to kick-back in the music room or sit out on a balcony in this south-facing home, this property has it all - especially for beach lovers. Weekend's CHRIS CAMPBELL takes a look.MOMENTS away from Bracelet Bay is this four bedroom property offering a perfect family spot with outstanding sea views.In fine weather, the owners enjoy a dip in the sea before returning back to their home in Cleveland Avenue, Limeslade - what they call their Californian beach house - for a barbecue.They have many a peaceful evening, with the blinds of the impressive conservatory open, letting the moonlight in as they drift off to sleep.This conservatory and the spacious open plan lounge/dining room have wonderful views out to sea.Two en suite shower rooms and a bathroom mean that when their sons or guests come to stay there is plenty of space for privacy.The owner, who has lived at the house with his wife for almost five years and did not wish to be named, says the south-facing layout of the house meant it is perfect for enjoying sunshine throughout the day."It's very easy to live here," he says. "We have lived by the sea most of our lives but this is different. We describe it as our equivalent to a Californian beach house."Our sons come home with their partners and they have their own rooms and space."The couple re-laid two patios, to the front and back of the property, and a picket fence runs around the house. This includes six gateways. It means children can play in certain areas and it was helpful when letting their late Labrador outside.Through the hallway, the kitchen also has sea views, with a window to the front.The lounge has an attractive beamed ceiling and there is a wall-mounted, flame effect gas fire, with a remote control. A purple painted wall - the couple have had the inside and outside of the house repainted - complements the wooden beams and adds a splash of colour to an otherwise neutral coloured home.See these four housing schemes which could change the face of SwanseaA wooden staircase can also be found in this room as well as a painting of the coast on the wall, plus family photographs. The space is well-used and shouts comfort.There are two good-size balconies offering those great views and where morning coffee and newspapers or evening drinks can be enjoyed. The view is a lovely mix of nature, nearby houses and, of course, the sea.A four suite bathroom can be found on this floor, with a walk-in shower and under floor heating. The bathroom also has a built-in sound system.Two bedrooms with beamed ceilings and built-in wardrobes can be found on the first floor, plus one of the en suite shower rooms.Those wanting to play or listen to a little music and enjoy a few drinks, can head to the basement, where there is a music room - with guitar - and bar. This is actually the same level as the garden and has doors out onto it. Bedrooms three and four, again with built-in wardrobes, can be found here. There is an en suite too, with wooden flooring and a step-in shower.An attractive, newly resurfaced lane leading to the property at the front creates driveway parking for several cars. There is also a garden here.To the back, an attractive patio leads onto the south-facing lawned garden area. A raised decked area is to the side.Cleveland Avenue is close to Mumbles and the beach-side promenade, boutique shops, wine bars and traditional pubs it offers.The owner adds: "This house is made up of different layers. It's got everything, whether you're enjoying a barbecue after the beach or want to relax in the music room on the lower floor."The property: Four-bedroom detached house, which makes the most of its stunning viewsWho lives here: Older couple. Their children come back to visit.The look: Modern and open with beach house feel but with beamed ceilings.Lessons learnt: Find a south-facing home to make the most of the sunshine throughout the day.
It was the match of the day as Bobby Moore's granddaughter kicked off married life - full of joyful highlights but missing a couple of key players.The granddaughter of the England ­football hero married her childhood sweetheart at Chelsea register office in front of 12 loved ones.Poppy Moore and Sam Myers, both 23, then held the second leg at a London’s Mayfair Hotel with 50 guests.Poppy carried a picture of her late dad Dean in her wedding bouquet. He died of natural causes in July 2011, aged 43.She was just 18 months old when in February 1993 granddad Bobby, who captained England’s 1966 World Cup winning side, died of bowel cancer, aged 51.Tragic: Bobby Moore with granddaughter Poppy the day after he revealed he had cancerHer mum Sara said: “Bobby would’ve been very proud of his granddaughter and very happy. She is a beautiful young lady and a credit to us all.“It was a very special day, it was lovely. Her father Dean would have been so proud of her, too. It’s such a shame that he couldn’t be with us.”Poppy marked the 20th anniversary of the legend's death in 2013 with his two other grandchildren, Freddie and Ava. They placed the ball on the spot for a West Ham home game - the club he skippered for ten years.Poppy is also involved with the Moore Family Fund to fight bowel cancer.Moore, who would have been 74 today, won 108 England caps, including 90 as captain and was ­described by Brazil legend Pele as “the greatest defender I ever played against”.

DUNBLANE (UNITED KINGDOM) - Tennis ace Andy Murray married his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears at Dunblane's 12th century cathedral on Saturday, bringing his Scottish hometown to a standstill.The newlyweds came under a shower of confetti as they left the church at 5.40 pm (1640GMT), just over an hour after they arrived.Sears wore a white dress with a plunging neckline, lace sleeves and a long train carried by four bridesmaids while the groom wore a green and blue tartan kilt.A bagpiper earlier welcomed the 2013 Wimbledon champion into the church while Sears arrived in a car a few minutes later, to a peel of applause from the gathered crowds.Ahead of the service, Murray posted a series of "emojis" to his 2.98 million Twitter followers, revealing his plans for the day. They ended with cocktails, kisses and several Zzzz sleep symbols.Despite earlier hailstorms, the sun shone on family and friends as they arrived for the intimate service in Dunblane Cathedral, which was decorated with huge bouquets of white hydrangeas and full-sized blossom trees.With an eye on the skies, Murray's mother Judy tweeted: "Hailstones. Marvellous" and then later "Snowing. #whitewedding".Murray revealed that his brother Jamie and friends Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier were to share best man duties.Several fans camped overnight to catch a glimpse of the couple and the streets were festooned with bunting in scenes usually reserved for a royal wedding.Reverend Colin Renwick, who married the couple, received huge cheers as he arrived at the cathedral.The 27-year-old Sears has already become accustomed to the limelight, often finding herself in the cameraman's sights while watching Murray courtside at events all around the world.She too grew up in a tennis-loving home with father Nigel Sears formerly the LTA's head of women's tennis.Shedding her demure image, Sears hit the front pages during this year's Australian Open when she was filmed muttering expletives in the direction of the box of Czech opponent Tomas Berdych.She turned up at the next match wearing a "parental advisory explicit content" jersey.Sears was once described by Judy Murray as "the best thing to happen to Andy".But he reportedly upset her when in January this year he sent a 'joke' message to a fan saying: "We are getting married just after Wimbledon, should be a great day," only to have to issue a retraction in a follow-up tweet.The world number three player is hosting the reception at his own 15-bedroom Cromlix House Hotel, which he bought two years ago for pound sterling1.9 million ($2.8 million, 2.6 million euros).Pubs in the town got into the spirit, offering champagne and strawberries to mark the occasion.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon offered her support, saying: "Andy is a local hero there but he is also a Scottish sporting superstar, and the whole nation will be delighted for him and his new wife."The grand slam champion predicted few nerves come game time."We've been together like nine-and-a-half years and we've lived together for six or seven years as well," he said."So, I don't think a whole lot's going to change."Murray and Dunblane share a painful past after the town was hit by tragedy in March 1996 when Thomas Hamilton shot 16 pupils and a teacher dead at the Scot's primary school.The tennis player, who had to hide in the school during the massacre, broke down in tears when discussing it during a television interview.
South Carolina grandmother Joyce Kuhl has launched a new class lawsuit against the SeaWorld center in Orlando, Florida - in which she accuses the marine park of trying to mask "the ugly truth about the unhealthy and despairing lives of these whales". In the lawsuit, she claims the orcas in the Orlanda park are kept in 8ft deep holding pools - supposedly leaving them with horrific sunburn. She then alleges that the resulting burns are so bad, staff are forced to PAINT over the wounds with black zinc oxide to disguise the injuries. The lawsuit also claims that chlorine solution "many times stronger than household bleach" is being used in tanks where the whales are confined after being caught or bred. "These orcas suffer in tiny, unnatural chemical tubs," the court document states.The creatures are also forced to go days without food while being trained, the lawsuit alleges. And it also claims that the whales are "subject to drugging" to help calm them when they react against conditions in their confinement. "Perhaps most telling, captive orcas are also subject to drugging by SeaWorld personnel with antipsychotic and psychoactive drugs, including benzodiazepines such as Diazepam (generic Valium), which are given to calm the captive orcas which react against their conditions of confinement," the lawsuit states. Ms Kuhl pointed out in the document that in the wild, orcas live between 30 and 50 years - whereas she said most orcas in SeaWorld die in their teens or 20s.She is now seeking to have her $97 ticket money from her December 2013 trip reimbursed - as well as tickets for millions of other visitors who have been to the park in the past four years, the Orlando Sentinel reports. SeaWorld Florida is visited by over 5 million people a year, according to the lawsuit. At around $100 a ticket, this means the park could potentially be sued for at least $2billion. On Friday, SeaWorld said it "is committed in every respect to the health and well-being of the animals in our care" and said the lawsuit "appears to be an attempt by animal right extremists to use the courts to advance an anti-zoo agenda". They continued: "The suit is baseless, filled with inaccuracies, and SeaWorld intends to defend itself against these inaccurate claims." The Guardian was told by a source that Ms Kuhl is not an animal rights activist, but "an ordinary animal lover" who found out information after visiting the aquatic park that was "inconsistent" with the company's marketing. This is the second time that SeaWorld has been sued in less than three weeks, after a class action lawsuit was filed in California last month. The California lawsuit targets all three SeaWorld locations - San Diego in California, San Antonio in Texas and Orlando in Florida.
British comedian Russell Brand has tweeted his support for saving Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran from an Indonesian firing squad.Saturday's tweet from Brand (@rustyrockets) reads: "These Aussie blokes are going to be killed soon for a bit of daft drug smuggling (they've done 10 yrs already) HELP! info.mercycampaign.org/watch/."The tweet includes a link to the website of the campaign for mercy for the convicted drug traffickers, where video interviews of the pair can be viewed and a petition signed.Brand is well known for his outspoken views on politics and human rights and in February blasted Australia's policy of using offshore migrant detention centres.Chan and Sukumaran's fight to avoid execution last week moved to Indonesia's constitutional court after they lost a bid to challenge their clemency rejections in the state administrative court.The pair's lawyers on Thursday sought a constitutional court review to make clear the president's obligations on considering clemency.Attorney-General HM Prasetyo has dismissed the latest challenge as delaying tactics and says he won't recognise it.Jakarta is now just waiting on the legal efforts of a few other death row prisoners before setting an execution date.The Sydney men are now imprisoned on Central Java's Nusakambangan island, where Indonesia plans to execute them by firing squad.
WASHINGTON - A person shot him or herself dead near the U.S. Capitol on Saturday, sparking a security lockdown at the complex, U.S. Capitol police said.Police were also investigating a suspicious package on the lower west terrace of the Capitol building in Washington, and several nearby streets were closed. Several media reports said it was luggage left by the person.Police said the lockdown was a precautionary measure."There are no indications at this point of terrorism," a U.S. official told NBC News."The Capitol has been locked down because of the potential security threat. No one can enter or exit," Capitol Police spokeswoman Kimberly Schneider said in a statement.She did not say if the person was a man or a woman.The incident occurred on a Saturday and Congress is out of session this week, so few lawmakers were in town. But the city was crowded with tourists visiting for the popular annual Cherry Blossom festival.
Washington: At 115, Jeralean Talley is now the world's oldest person. The American leads the elite club of "supercentenarians" – people more than 111 years old.It's not as small a club as you may think. More than 50 people, carefully tallied by US researchers, have passed the milestone.After Monday's death of fellow American Gertrude Weaver, who would have turned 117 on July 4, Talley is the oldest person recorded by the Los Angeles-based Gerontology Research Group (GRG),An African American, she was born in the southern US state of Georgia at the tail end of the 19th century on May 23, 1899. These days she lives near Detroit.Talley is part of even more restricted club of three people recorded as having seen three centuries: the final years of the 19th, the full sweep of the 20th and the start of the 21st.In this she joins Susannah Mushatt Jones, also an African American, born July 6, 1899 and Italy's Emma Morano-Martinuzzi, born November 29, 1899."There is always a small chance that there's somebody out that has not applied. To show up at 116 is not very likely but it's still possible," said Robert Young, a GRG researcher and an expert for Guinness World Records.The GRG, which bases its tally on the work of researchers, demographers, biologists and amateur enthusiasts, has for now counted 52 people – 50 women and two men – who have surpassed 111 years and can prove it with a birth certificate and marriage certificates for surname changes.Peru's Filomena Taipe, who local authorities said died on Monday at the age of 117, did not have original proof of birth, said Young.The Peruvian government said she was born on December 20, 1897, the date on her national identity card."Ninety-nine per cent of people that claim to be over 115 turn out to be false," the researcher said.He estimated at more than 1000 the number of people who may be 110, and at around 300 those who have been certified as having that many years under their belt.Talley took the title held for five days by Weaver following the death of Japan's Misao Okawa. She died on April 1, less than a month after turning 117.Talley told the Detroit Free Press that the secret to her longevity comes "from above"."That's the best advice I can give you. It's not in my hands or your hands," she said, pointing toward the heavens.Time magazine, who contacted her family, including her only daughter, 77-year-old Thelma Holloway, said the new doyenne eats lots of pork, is a true night owl and kept up her bowling hobby until the age of 104.On her birthdays, she likes to go fishing.Slightly younger, Susannah Mushatt Jones, born in Alabama, has no children but for many years she looked after those of rich families.She studied "negro music in France" and likes fine lingerie and barbecues, according to US media reports.These supercentenarians, Young said, are people who "have taken care of themselves, they stay independent, they are mentally strong."They have social networks such as church and family," he added.They stayed active for a long time, sleep well and eat in moderation, he added."It's like winning the genetic lottery, but it's not enough. You also have to live your life the right way," Young said."You have to keep your vices in check."Sarah Knauss, an american who died at the age of 119, hated vegetables and Jeanne Calment of France, who died at the age of 122, smoked two or three cigarettes a day, he added.The number of supercentenarians could well grow because life expectancy is growing and the world population is also increasing. Documentation is also easier to come by, although Africa, China and India lag behind in this.He said that the number of people reaching 115 is going to increase slowly.The record for the person to have lived the longest – and with papers to prove it – is still held by Calment of France. She passed away in 1997 at the age of 122 years and 164 days.
President Barack Obama declared his refusal to refight the Cold War battles of the past while Cuban President Raul Castro rallied to his defence, absolving Obama of fault for the U. blockade in a stunning reversal of more than 50 years of animosity between the two countries.Castro, in an hour-long speech to the Summit of the Americas in Panama City, ran through an exhaustive history of perceived Cuban grievances against the US dating back more than a century - a vivid display of how raw passions remain over American attempts to undermine Cuba's government.Then, in an abrupt about face, he apologised for letting his emotions get the best of him. He said many US presidents were at fault for that troubled history - but that Obama isn't one of them."I have told President Obama that I get very emotional talking about the revolution," Castro said through a translator, noting that Obama wasn't even born when the US began sanctioning the island nation."I apologise to him because President Obama had no responsibility for this."In a remarkable vote of confidence from a Cuban leader, Castro added: "In my opinion, President Obama is an honest man."Castro and Obama were expected to meet later tonight on the sidelines of the summit - the first substantial meeting between a US and Cuban president in more than five decades. The flurry of diplomacy was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their previously announced plan to restore normal relations between the US and Cuba.Speaking just before Castro, Obama acknowledged that deep differences between their countries would persist. Yet he said he was uninterested in getting bogged down in ideology, instead casting the thaw in relations as an opening to create "more opportunities and resources for the Cuban people"."The United States will not be imprisoned by the past," President Barack Obama said. "We're looking to the future."Raising the stakes even higher for the two leaders was mounting speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit taking place in Panama to announce his decision to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism, a gesture that for Cuba holds both practical and symbolic value.The US long ago stopped accusing Cuba of conducting terrorism, and Obama has signalled that he's ready to take Cuba off the list. On Thursday, he suggested an announcement was imminent when he revealed that the State Department had completed its lengthy review of the designation.Obama arrived at the summit for a day of marathon meetings with leaders from across the Western Hemisphere, gathered around a massive oval table with two birds of peace in the middle.A successful relaunch of US-Cuba relations would form a cornerstone of Obama's foreign policy legacy. But it is an endeavour he cannott undertake alone: Only Congress can fully lift the onerous US sanctions regime on Cuba, and there are deep pockets of opposition in the US to taking that step.
President John Mahama and his government must investigate the tirade of deputy trade and industry minister Ibrahim Murtala Muhammed and reprimand him, Editor-in-chief of the New Crusading Guide newspaper Kweku Baako has said.Mr Baako told Joy FM’s news analysis programme newsfile Saturday that Mr Muhammed’s “utterances are weighty enough to warrant some level of investigations.”In his view, the Nanton MP “must be held accountable and [asked to] provide answers”.According to him, “He is already a problem. The presidency may have to take a look at him.”“The allegations that he made ought to be investigated. Personally he has damaged himself in many ways. A deputy minister of state does not take to radio to say those things…” Mr Baako told host Samson Lardy Anyenini.“I will expect that a certain public reprimand or show of some public sanction ought to be meted out.”Mr Muhammed, in an interview on Tamale-based Diamond FM, recently accused a fellow legislator in the same governing National Democratic Congress (NDC) of scheming to court disaffection for him in his own constituency and eventually get him out.“It is pathetic, absolutely pathetic: it’s unethical, it’s so funny, it’s so stupid, it’s so silly, it’s nasty, it’s un-Islamic for people in the same party to be sitting down and their intention is about how they can get someone out of Parliament,” he burst out.He warned the chiefs, Mallams and party elders in the constituency against restraining him if he began speaking out to expose his detractors, since in his opinion, those leaders are not speaking against his detractors because they have been bought with “filthy, ill-gotten money”.Apart from his radio outburst, Mr Muhammed alleged on his Facebook page recently that a fellow MP, who is also a Minister hired a girl and equipped her with a tablet so she could get nude pictures of a fellow Cabinet Minister.He was summoned by the presidency over the allegations.

At last, redemption for our brown and pleasant land. "When I look at the map and see what an ugly country Australia is," Oscar Wilde wrote a hundred and a bitty years ago, "I feel that I want to go there and see if it cannot be changed into a more beautiful form." This week though, American astronaut Scott Kelly gazed down and saw something better than a mere map, he saw the continent in its entirety. He was moved enough to tweet: "#Australia. You are very beautiful. Thanks for being there to brighten our day." Beam us up, Scotty! A pleasure. Fly well.One of our heroesAs we speak, TFF is writing a book on the battle of Fromelles and Pozieres where, in a period of around six weeks Australia suffered a staggering 28,000 casualties – with more men killed in just 14 hours at Fromelles than in the Boer War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Iraq and Afghanistan put together. One of the casualties was Victorian woodcutter Albert Jacka, who had already distinguished himself by being Australia's first recipient of a Victoria Cross for his courage under fire at Gallipoli. At Pozieres on August 7, he doubled the dose, and many considered him unlucky not to win a second Victoria Cross, though personally, Jacka was just glad to have narrowly survived, having been wounded seven times in the action. He went on to be mayor of St Kilda, and when he died in 1932, his coffin was borne by eight fellow winners of the VC. .I applaud Bill Shorten, urging the government to tighten the rules which allow conscientious objectors to omit having their children vaccinated, if they fill out a form stating they have a "personal, philosophical, religious or medical belief involving a conviction that vaccination should not take place..." I don't get him allowing an enduring exception for those with strong religious beliefs against it. This is not philosophically coherent. We, as a society, have rightly decided we have a duty of care to all our children to ensure they are vaccinated. How is that duty abrogated because the parents of a child decide their particular Magic Sky Daddy is against it? Too bad. The duty of care to the child clearly outweighs the parents' adherence to superstitions. And while you may disagree because of your own superstitions, the State, surely, must be free of them, and so insist.Up at the Cross's Bourbon & Beefsteak, there's this barman, see, who is so sure that he is the strongest man around that, with the blessing of his boss – who figures it's good for business – he offers a standing $100 bet ... What he does, follow, is use the power in his massive forearms and hands to squeeze a lemon until all the juice runs into a glass, and then hands the lemon to the patron. Anyone who can squeeze two more drops of juice out of it wins the money. They come, they go, over the years. Weightlifters, dockworkers, footballers, wrestlers, gym junkies from that all-night gym down on Crown Street, but nobody ever manages to do it!One day, though, this scrawny little bloke comes into the bar, wearing Coke-bottle glasses and a polyester suit. He sits down, orders a glass of draft beer and spots the sign on the wall about the lemon challenge. "I was just reading your sign," he says in a small voice, "and I'd like to try the bet." After the laughter dies down, the bartender says, "OK". Grabbing the lemon, he squeezes it until the pips squeak, and hands the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little fellow. Without any further ado, the customer clenches his little fist around the lemon ... and six drops fall into the glass. As the crowd cheers, the stunned bartender pays the bloke his money, and asks the obvious: "Do you mind if I ask what do you do for a living? Are you a dockworker, a weight-lifter, or what?"The little fellow quietly replies: "I work for the tax department."They said it"As you know there are a lot of wackos out there as well.

If there's one thing the government, opposition and business are agreed on it is the importance of Asia and the Pacific in Australia's future development.Central to our engagement is knowledge of the region's cultures and languages, so you would think that the key school at the Australian National University teaching and researching these subjects would be booming.But not so.  A budget review has found that the school of Culture, History and Language - the major Asian languages teaching school at the university - is running at a loss.According to the director of the school, Professor Ken George, a budget review in the first half of 2014 revealed that "operational costs attached to CHL's current structure, activities, and strategic vision had exceeded actual and anticipated revenues".Those conditions persist, he says, in a recent statement telling all staff and students that an academic review of the school would help renew its intellectual mission, redraw its institutional design and set plans to ensure its sustainability as a globally visible, world-leading centre for research and teaching.As part of this review all staff have been ordered to assess their own performance and academics, including professors, are being called in individually and asked to consider early retirement, continuity, redeployment, or redundancy.Insiders say morale has plummeted with senior staff getting the impression they are no longer wanted.The process is also reviving memories of the ANU School of Music debacle when the university cut 23 academic and nine administrative staff in 2012.ACT branch of the National Tertiary Education Union president Jack Bowers says the ANU has used the term review in the past as a code word for what the union considers to be the wholesale decimation of schools. Internal accounting had frequently been used as a justification for reviews and that seemed to be the case now.Others suggest the shake-up and the morale-destroying one-on-one staff interviews are influenced by financial considerations.The university has a central voluntary early retirement fund and if senior staff leave early their accumulated entitlements can be paid out of this fund.This would save the school itself from having to make redundancy payments in the event of a downsizing. In the case of redundancy the school would be required to pay three weeks' salary for each year of service with a minimum payment of five weeks' pay and maximum of 68 weeks.Professor Veronica Taylor, the Dean of the ANU College of Asia and the Pacific, in which the school resides, says as part of identifying options to strengthen the school, academic staff are "being invited to think about their own professional pathways, and - for senior staff - whether now is a good time to consider early retirement or pre-retirement planning"."The review is in its early stages and no staff or part of the school have been identified for redundancies," she says.But many of the staff who have been asked to consider continuity, voluntary early retirement, redeployment, or redundancy see it differently.One of the dangers is that the most valued staff – those most likely to be wanted by other institutions – will be the first to leave.The one-on-one interviews with the discussions of redundancy options are being held before an external review panel begins an examination later this year to determine the precise role, excellence, innovativeness and sustainability of the school.Given the way the process is being handled, some staff, in key positions that the university would want to maintain, may well have decided to leave before the panel brings down its recommendations.The school may well find it's not easy to get replacements and its reputation will suffer accordingly.There is also the question of who will carry on teaching and supervising PhD candidates if senior academics leave.The ANU is proud of its high standing in world university rankings, usually either ranking as the highest or second highest Australian university.This is in large part due to its international outlook and its performance in Arts and Humanities.The Times Higher Education World University Rankings, for example, gives the university an overall score of 66.5 but in the five categories of teaching, international outlook, industry outcome, research and citations the highest score it gets is the 91.3 in international outlook.Slashing a school which must be making a major contribution to this score hardly seems sensible.The school also boasts four members holding prestigious Australian Research Council Laureate Fellowships – the highest number of such fellowships in any school at the university.Eight years have gone by since the College of Asia and the Pacific's conceptual launch in 2006 and six since its 2008 strategic review.The school of Culture, History and Language within CAP was formally constituted in 2010, making its review seem premature.Professor Taylor acknowledges that the typical review cycle in the university is six to seven years.She says other academic units within her College and across the ANU are scheduled for reviews on this cycle.In 2012, then opposition leader Tony Abbott drew attention to the fact that Australia was supposed to be adapting to the Asian century but Australians' study of foreign languages, especially Asian languages, was in precipitous decline.From every perspective - trade deals with China, Japan and South Korea, understanding of threats and conflict in the region, business, tourism, culture, environmental destruction – knowledge of the languages of the region and high level university research is essential.If the school is indeed running at a loss then perhaps the solution is to find ways to boost revenue rather than cut staff.Better marketing of what the school has to offer undergraduate, postgraduate and doctoral students would be a start.Scaring those with the foremost knowledge of the Asia Pacific region into leaving the ANU is not the way of the future.
Hundreds of mourners have gathered for the funeral of Walter Scott, an unarmed black suspect who was shot dead by a white officer in South Carolina as he fled following a routine traffic stop.Mr Scott's death, which a bystander caught on video, reignited debates about excessive police force and race relations in the United States.His body arrived on Saturday at Word Ministries Christian Centre where family, friends, politicians and law enforcement gathered to bury the 50-year-old father of four.Mr Scott's casket was draped in an American flag and a Dallas Cowboys sign in honour of his favourite football team.An estimated 200 to 300 people gathered outside the church as the family entered, and a funeral program showed photos of the family along with the words "We Will Miss You".South Carolina senator Tim Scott posted on Twitter ahead of the funeral: "Attending Walter Scott's homegoing service. Thankful to have been able to pray and talk with his family this week."Reverend James Johnson, president of the local chapter of civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network, said he hoped Mr Scott's death would lead to something good."This is a sad day," Reverend Johnson said ahead of the service."God has got a reason for what has happened. Hopefully this will heal the world."The officer who killed Mr Scott, 33-year-old Michael Slager, was charged with murder and fired from the force. He faces life in prison or the death penalty if convicted.The bystander video shows Mr Scott running from Slager, who pulls his gun and fires eight shots, five of which hit Mr Scott.An earlier dash cam video shows Mr Scott's car being pulled over by Slager, who asks for Mr Scott's registration before Mr Scott runs away after Slager returns to his own vehicle.Mr Scott's father said his son may have been running because he owed child support and did not want to return to jail.South Carolina police said they were suspicious of the shooting from the beginning because of "inconsistencies" in Slager's initial reporting of events and multiple gunshot wounds in Mr Scott's back.Slager had said he felt threatened during his encounter with Mr Scott.North Charleston mayor Keith Summey said the city's police would be required to wear body cameras in the future to record interactions with the public.US congressman James Clyburn, who was among the 500 people at the funeral, said he wanted national strategies and standards for law enforcement to be considered."Body cameras are a good start. They're certainly not a panacea," Mr Clyburn said.Mr Scott had a history of arrests for failing to pay child support and was forced out of the US Coast Guard in 1986 after more than two years' service because of a drug offence.He was nonetheless discharged under honourable conditions because he had a good record of service, the Coast Guard said.Demonstrators gathered for peaceful protests in North Charleston after the killing, with some demanding the city council create a citizens review board to look into police conduct.Mr Scott's family called for greater accountability among police and hoped Mr Scott's death would spark reform within the force.His shooting came in the wake of a series of similar incidents that have provoked outrage and protests across the United States, most notoriously the killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri last August.There are no comprehensive national statistics on how many people die at US police hands each year.Human Rights Watch estimates that out of a reported more than 2,700 police-involved deaths deemed "justifiable" by authorities between 2005-2011, just 41 officers were charged.The US Justice Department has launched investigations into a number of police departments, including Ferguson's, after shootings.
PHILADELPHIA - The Senators wrote their own version of Philadelphia Freedom Saturday afternoon ... a ticket to the playoffs.The most historic comeback in NHL history is complete.Fourteen points out of a playoff spot on Feb. 10, the Senators went a remarkable 23-4-4 in their last 31 games by closing out the season with an incredible 3-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at the Wells Fargo Center.Not since the 1993-94 New York Islanders came from 12 points back has a team closed a larger gap to make the post-season.Like they have on so many nights throughout this incredible run, the Senators turned to Andrew (The Hamburglar) Hammond, who was brilliant with 34 stops while Mark Stone scored twice and Jean-Gabriel Pageau chipped in to beat Philadelphia goalie Steve Mason on the 22 shots he faced.The Senators will have to watch Hockey Night in Canada to find out who they face in the first round. The New York Rangers have been ruled out but depending on the outcome of Saturday night's games it could either be the Montreal Canadiens or the Tampa Bay Lightning.It wasn't the Senators best effort but Stone put it away in the third with his 26th of the season on a breakaway. Hammond moved his record to 20-1-2. Wow.Ahead 2-1 after 40 minutes, the Senators were fortunate to be in that position.They were outshot 30-13 through two periods by the Flyers and were being completely outplayed. Hammond had to come up huge, otherwise, there's not a hope the Senators are in the lead.For a long time, the Senators looked like they needed a walk-up call at a time they were having their afternoon naps. That came midway through the second period when coach Dave Cameron read them the riot act because he didn't like what was happening on the ice one bit.The Senators were outshot 16-8 but Pageau's 10th of the season at 16:18 gave the club the lead. Defenceman Marc Methot did a great job taking the puck coast-to-coast and then Pageau, who had plenty of chances, went to the net and beat Mason on the glove side putting it home at 16:18.Sitting back trying to protect the lead, the Senators got burned only 1:23 into the second when Read tied it up. He was left alone in front of the net and all he had to do was take a pass from Brayden Schenn to beat Hammond on glove side to tie it up and make everybody in Ottawa nervous.The Senators weren't sure what to make of their start.They were outshot 14-5 by the Flyers but led where it counted the most with a 1-0 advantage on the scoreboard. Hammond wasn't tested a whole lot but did make a good stop on Brayden Schenn down low on a power play. The Senators did go stretch of almost 13 minutes without a shot on Mason.While they had a few good opportunities, it was a gift-goal that opened the scoring on the power play for Ottawa. Mason misplayed the puck in his own end by giving it to Clarke MacArthur in the circle, he threw it to Stone in the slot and all he had to do was put it into an open net at 6:06.The Senators are expected to open the playoffs in Tampa or Montreal Thursday.
Listening to a diner asking about the provenance of the chicken she was about to order, whether the juices served at the cafe were organic and if their vinegar was in fact gluten free, I was left wondering where I'd observed this devotion to purity before.The idea of sanctity has a hard time gaining traction in an increasingly secular Australia, and invoking "purity" when it comes to sex and our bodies is likely to see you roasted by feminists and flirty footballers alike.Despite this, there are many conservatives in this country, and billions more worldwide, who view promiscuity, virginity, abortion, contraception – and the "purity" these practices ensure or defile – as moral issues with distinctly right and wrong answers governed by universal law.In turn, you don't have to go far to find a Greens voter or small-l liberal who considers meat eating, factory farming, genetically modified foods, pesticides and the environmental degradation caused by all of the above as equally pressing moral concerns, governed by that same universal law.Listening to the likes of Pete Evans preach about paleo, Sarah Wilson sermonise about sugar, or any number of TV chefs pontificate about macrobiotics, ancient grains, the terroir of heirloom tomatoes and the need to use the "freshest" foods available, you'd have to admit there's more than a pinch of piety going around when it comes to food.Get a certain type of hipster started about water quality, coffee beans and cold-pressed juice and you might as well pull up an ironic deconstruction of a stool and take a seat for the duration of the ensuing monologue.What's interesting, however, is the inability of both ends of the political spectrum to take seriously the other's views on purity, while being deadly serious about the obvious nature of their own conceptions.The further you travel along both these  paths of belief, the more likely you'll also encounter "magic" and pseudo-scientific claims backed by little evidence but plenty of faith. Last week's epic takedown of the American 'Food Babe' blogger by an actual scientist is an amusing case in point.While it's difficult to argue with the data on the benefits of cutting down on red meat, sugar and cholesterol, many of the more fashionable assertions made by foodie evangelists seem to occupy the same gormless, glowing gap in the firmament where Our Lord Allah Jehovah Yahweh the Sky Wizard lives.Many liberals would passionately argue that notions of religious and bodily purity – and its close relative sanctity – have no place in discussions of morality, yet they are happy to moralise about the sacredness of the environment, animal welfare and "natural" food production.The truth, as any psychologist will tell you, is our ideas about purity – whether they concern sex, food, or spirituality – derive from ancient (and in many cases accurate) beliefs our bodies can be desecrated by both immoral acts and contaminants.As the influential social psychologist Jonathan Haidt puts it: "Purity is not just about suppressing female sexuality, it's about any kind of ideology that tells you you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body, by controlling what you put into your body."Religious conceptions of purity in food are well known to Jews and Muslims, and vegetarianism stretches from Buddhists and Jains all the way to Seventh Day Adventist Christians. However, the disgust felt by a vegan yoga mum about a veal parmigiana is no less real than that felt by a Salvo or Hillsonger contemplating certain "unnatural" sexual acts.Both believe your body is a temple, they just disagree on the rites conducted therein.
PDP’s Ishaku in early lead in 10 councils of TarabaThe Peoples Democratic (PDP) was in early lead in the governorship and State Assembly elections in ten of the sixteen local government councils of Taraba state on Saturday.The PDP which fielded Darius Dickson Ishaku was leading in Wukari, Donga, Karimlamido, Kurmi, Bali, Takum, Ussa, Zing, Yorro and Jalingo -the state capital.Bali local government area had voted for the President Elect Gen. Muhammadu Buhari in the presidential election. but the people however voted for the PDP in Saturday’s guber polls.Ailing Governor Danbaba Suntai left the Government House in Jalingo early morning to his village Suntai to vote for his PDP candidate (Ishaku).A heavy crowd swarmed him, some shielding tears of love and joy. They queued behind him to vote for PDP.Suntai voted in his Maman 012 polling unit of Suntai Ward.The governor did his accreditation and voting in his official car.The PDP was also leading in the House of Assembly elections.The PDP candidates in Wukari I and II constituencies were already declared winners as at press time.Mean while the elections in Kashimbilla and Malushe areas of Takum were postponed for Sunday.
It's back: Simon Cowell and Britain's Got TalentPoor old Simon Cowell. Still banging on about “changing lives” after The Voice proved that what the nation really wants is a show that does nothing of the sort.Ironically, not finding stars amid a pathetic parade of preposterous no-hopers remains Britain’s Got Talent’s strongest selling point.As the Dark Lord’s end-of-the-pier follies returned for a meaningless ninth series, who could recall last year’s winner? Anyone?I think it was another of those godawful classical opera groups that thoroughly unmodern Simon, 55, loves so much. Carcrashio or something.But who cares? Because, SuBo, Paul Potts and Diversity notwithstanding, BGT isn’t about ­propelling people to fame and fortune.No, this fun-packed programme’s principal purpose is to make us laugh by bombarding us with an 80-minute collection of crazy clips.Mission accomplished in the case of that hilarious hound Max who, instead of treating us to his amazing tricks, kept running off the stage to attack cowering Ant.Mad Max was the smash hit of the night. But not in a good way.Then we were supposed to give a damn when Cowell achieved his weird lifelong ambition of discovering a singing canine.Step forward French marvel-mutt Wendy. Who can’t sing. But can lower her jaw to order while ventriloquist Marc puts words into her mouth. Ooh la la.Quite why we had to endure stunned Simon theatrically phoning his lover to tell her the unastonishing news is a mystery.“Are you sitting down, Lauren?” he gasped. “A dog came in and sang!” David Walliams: “Well, it didn’t.” Exactly.Never mind. These are the best moments. When ITV’s annual search for an instantly forgotten nobody doesn’t take itself too ­seriously.The worst bits involve all four judges adopting their lost-in-wonder expressions as some ­mediocre wannabe proves to be halfway proficient at a daft act that will never make the mainstream.Doe-eyed duo Amanda Holden and Alesha Dixon both have the impressive ability to look as if they’re close to tears.Occasionally, it almost seems genuine.After that massive Welsh choir Ysgol Glanaethwy (usual spelling) completed their passable performance you’d have thought Cowell and the standing ovation gang had just witnessed the Second Coming.Then, of course, there were the comedy losers who were sacrificed on the altar of mass entertainment.The comb player, the dummy with the vulture dummy, the cello biddies, chicken woman...Only Syco Simon believes this ritual humiliation is TV gold. In fact, it’s not very funny, horribly cruel and embarrassingly old-fashioned. Make it stop.Meanwhile, how long did it take them to edit the carefully choreographed brilliant brother/useless sister sequence?Pinky & Perky sound-alike Calum Scott wasn’t that great. Nor was his sobbing sibling Jade that bad. But what a trumped-up golden buzzer story!Pretend spontaneous drama is what he does.That and repeating “a big fat yes” every five minutes. Can’t the big fat cliché king think of any-thing else to say?And last but certainly least... WTF were those scantily clad large ladies thinking?After Ms Dixon waffled on about “empowering women”, Simon insisted: “This is one of the best acts I’ve seen.” Yeah right. Let’s face it... they were rubbish.But what the hell. At least ­Britain’s Got Talent doesn’t change lives. Better still, unlike The X Factor, it doesn’t ruin them either...
Runners are pounding the footpaths this morning as part of the Tauranga Half Marathon.Runners take part in the Tauranga Half Marathon today. Photos by: Cameron Avery.Today marks one decade of the event gracing Tauranga City's streets, bringing with it a record number of participants keen on being part of history.In the running stakes, the men's elite half marathon field looks stronger than ever with last year's top two place-getters, locals Kyle and Iain MacDonald, returning.They will be pushed hard by a number of top performers including Jono Jackson from Auckland, a NZ representative mountain runner and multiple NZ championships medal winner over 10,000m.Jackson has a best half marathon of 67 minutes – one minute-and-a-half better than the MacDonald twins.The women's favourites appear to be last year's second place-getter Jess Ruthe who should be challenged by Aucklander Kelly Parlane, a consistent performer at national level distance running events.As well as the Half Marathon distance, there are also 14km, 7km and one mile (1.7km) options for those seeking a slightly shorter challenge.The first finishers are expected to cross the line at Fergusson Park about 8.10am. Other events will run throughout the morning, with the final event – the Matua Mile – at 10.30am.

Birmingham City midfielder has sparked a Twitter storm by taking a swipe at the fans of his former club Wolverhampton Wanderers .The 23-year-old made the switch from Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer after falling out-of-favour at the club.After the St Andrew's victory over Wolves, he couldn't resist a dig at the club he left behind.The tweet sparked quite the response on Twitter from angry Wolves fans.
VANCOUVER — As far as $100 doughnuts go, Jeanne Kaminski believes the Donutopia is a good deal.The doughnut — the humble fried confectionary of the masses — has been blinged out to the extreme at West Kelowna’s Dolicious Donuts.“Each one takes three to five hours to make. The value of the doughnut is more than $100,” said Dolicious owner Kaminski, co-creator of the lavish delicacy.The Donutopia, which rests in a sugar bowl and is decorated with 24-karat gold flakes and edible sugar “diamonds,” starts with the same simple, yet secret, 40-year-old recipe that Dolicious uses for all its doughnuts. The one difference is that the batter is made with Bling H20, a “luxury water” with a sale price that starts at $29 per 200ml bottle.“I saw it at Urban Fare and it said it was from the mountains of Tennessee. Now, I am from Tennessee so I knew that must be damn good water,” Kaminski said.Pinot Gris ice wine has been added to the cream filling, and the chocolate icing is infused with imported balsamic vinegar.“There are also gold flakes in the vinegar,” Kaminski noted.While the Donutopia may be the priciest doughnut in British Columbia, it’s a bargain compared to the £1,000 ($1,850) Dom Pérignon jelly Berliner served at a Krispy Kreme in England last year as part of a charity fundraiser during the U.K.’s national doughnut week.Kaminski’s extreme doughnut was conceived when a regular customer asked for a special doughnut to hide an engagement ring and then proposed to his fiancée inside the bakery.“It was such a happy thing that we came up with the Donutopia,” said Kaminski, who has sold just one of the $100 doughnuts, but has taken orders for several more.She said all proceeds from sales of the Donutopia are going toward the establishment of a soup kitchen in West Kelowna.
Abidjan – Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara inaugurated, on Saturday in Abidjan, an express way named after “King Mohammed VI”.The inauguration ceremony of the 4.6 kilometer expressway linking the communes of Abobo and Anyama was notably attended by Foreign Minister who was representing HM the King.The road was completed at a total cost of 13.5 million Euros and will be serving 1.8 million inhabitants of the two communes.Speaking on this occasion, the Ivorian President highlighted the longstanding ties of friendship and brotherhood between Morocco and Côte d’Ivoire.He said that naming the road after HM King Mohammed VI is a sign of appreciation and recognition to the Moroccan Sovereign for his “engagement to boost cooperation between the two countries.”In this respect, President Ouattara highlighted the importance of the projects implemented in his country with Moroccan support.Speaking on the same occasion, Mezouar said that naming the expressway after King Mohammed VI reflects “sincere friendship and brotherhood” and mirrors the willingness of the Ivorian president and HM the King to add fresh momentum to bilateral relations.Join the Conversation.

Details have emerged of how a gang pulled off an audacious jewellery heist by making off with the loot in wheelie bins.Astonishing CCTV footage shows the raiders breaking into a safe deposit box company where they spent two nights drilling through a reinforced concrete wall to reach the vault.Police issued nine still images from the CCTV cameras last night in an attempt to trace the jewel thieves.They stole an estimated £60 million in gems, cash and other valuable items, which they stuffed into wheelie bins before loading them on to the back of a Ford Transit van.The video footage was obtained from two cameras – one positioned on the street and the other by the rear fire exit through which the raiders gained entry to the premises of the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit company.Piecing together more than 120 hours of coverage from the two cameras, detectives have been able to build up a detailed picture of just how the raid was carried out.Det Chief Insp Paul Johnson said: “They were highly audacious, entering on two occasions over that weekend.“This footage along with other material continues to be evaluated to capture the precise movements of the suspects.”Police said that 72 of the 999 safe deposit boxes were opened. Of those, seven were empty. Police have so far contacted 42 owners while trying to reach the remaining victims.It is thought that one member of the gang may have hidden inside the building in order to let others in through a fire exit.Alternatively, they had assistance from a worker on the premises, home to a number of companies.The camera outside the fire-exit door shows the first member of the gang – a man dubbed Mr Ginger on account of his red hair – arrive at about 8.20pm on Thursday April 2, just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit company had locked up for the Easter bank holiday.The men reached the fire exit through an alley that leads from a side street in Hatton Garden, London’s famous jewellery quarter.But the alley itself is protected by a metal gate and the raiders would have needed a key to get through that, too. Police have said there was no evidence of a forced entry into the Hatton Garden premises.To reach the door they would have also needed a further key to get past a metal gate that led from the rear alley on to the street.At 8.27pm, a white van pulled up in the side street around the corner from the company’s front door and the gang unloaded wheelie bins from the back of the van.It is thought the wheelie bins contained power tools including a diamond-tipped drill for boring through the 7ft concrete wall and into the basement vault.The CCTV footage suggests there were at least six members of the gang, given the nicknames Mr Ginger, Mr Montana, the Old Man, the Tall Man, the Gent and Mr Strong, based on physical features or clothing glimpsed from the footage. Mostly, the men hid beneath hats, caps and balaclavas.The footage suggests they took about 20 minutes on Thursday evening to move tools into the building, taking them down the alley and in through the rear fire exit.The gang then disabled the lift on the second floor of the communal office building and descended into the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safety deposit boxes were kept in the company’s vault.The footage shows the men remained inside the premises for about seven hours.At just after midnight on Good Friday, they triggered the intruder alarm, but police decided no response was required – a decision that is now under internal investigation.The thieves used a Hilti 350 diamond coring drill to gain access to the vaultDuring the night, the men began their attempt to break into the vault, prising open steel shutters into the company’s offices before beginning the drilling operation.The footage then shows them emerging into daylight at about 7.50am on Good Friday before getting into the white van and driving off.They returned to the crime scene just after 10.15pm on Saturday and went back to work.The footage then shows them re-emerging at the fire exit at just after 6am on Easter Sunday, struggling with a wheelie bin that is thought to be crammed full of cash and gems stolen from safe deposit boxes. Other wheelie bins were also dragged to the van.Police have refused to put a value on the stolen goods but estimates say the figure is more than £60 million.Detectives are investigating a number of specific leads, not least because only a few gangs are capable of pulling off such a crime. It is likely the men have left the country and disposed of the gems.Given how well planned the raid was, it seems likely that the men had already worked out what to do with the stolen items.One outfit thought to be on the list of targets is the Pink Panther gang, which has carried out a number of international jewel raids.The Pink Panthers were given their nickname after a diamond ring they had stolen from a London jeweller’s was found hidden in a jar of face cream. They had borrowed the idea for concealing the gem from a plotline in the 1975 Peter Sellers film The Return of the Pink Panther.A leading member of the gang – a Bosnian called Milan Popari – has been on the run since breaking out of a Swiss jail in 2013. He was the third member to be sprung from prison that year.The Pink Panthers have raided jewellers not only in Britain but also in the United Arab Emirates, Japan, Switzerland, France and Monaco.In Dubai, they used black and white Audi limousines to drive across the polished floors of an upmarket shopping mall, where they smashed the front window of a jewellery store.In Tokyo, they took just 36 seconds to steal £2 million worth of gems from a store.Police in France are also investigating whether the gang is behind a £6.4million gems heist involving two security lorries last month.20.19, Thursday, April 2 Staff at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd, which provides “secure” storage for their clients’ “irreplaceable personal belongings”, lock up for the Easter weekend. The company, normally opens Monday to Friday, is not due to reopen until Tuesday morning because of the bank holiday. Hatton Garden, in which many Jewish-run diamond jewellers operate, is especially quiet because Easter coincides with the Jewish festival of Passover20.23 Four minutes later, the gang moves in. CCTV footage, made public yesterday, shows the first gang member arriving at a rear fire-exit door, reached through a narrow alley. Police later confirm there was no sign of forced entry. Dubbed Mr Ginger because of his red hair, seen beneath a black cap, the man wears latex gloves, a blue jacket and dark trousers. He is carrying a black bin bag20.27 A second CCTV camera captures a white Ford Transit van driving down Greville Street, around the corner from the front entrance to Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. It pulls up at the entrance to the side alley that offers access to a rear fire exit door into the communal building housing the safe deposit boxes. Men drag wheelie bins down the alley before the van leaves20.30 A second gang member, nicknamed the Gent because of his smart brown shoes, arrives carrying a large holdall. He has on a balaclava, a hard hat and a high-visibility jacket20.31 The gang member dubbed Mr Strong appears at the back door. He has steel supports and wears a hard hat. The supports may serve to hold in place the diamond-tipped drill used to break into the vault. Mr Strong and the Gent then carry more tools into the building20.36 A fourth man appears. Wearing a black sweatshirt bearing the words “Montana 93”, the man – Mr Montana – enters the building. He and Mr Strong drag in wheelie bins. One is thought to contain the 77lb drill used to bore through a 7ft reinforced concrete wall giving access to the basement vaults00.21, Friday April 3 An intruder alarm is set off at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company contacts the Metropolitan Police’s Central Communications Command. Police record the call but decide no response is needed – a decision now being internally investigated01.00 Mr Ginger is seen by the back door. There is no more movement above ground for almost seven hours. Inside the building, the gang disable the lift, leaving it on the second floor. They use the lift shaft to reach the basement, where the safe deposit boxes are held. They force open shutter doors into the company’s offices and bore holes into the vault wall using a Hilti DD350 drill07.51 The gang resurface after a night inside the premises. Mr Ginger leaves with two purple holdalls. Mr Montana carries out two red tool boxes. Footage shows him with a shaved head and possibly an earring. A minute later, the Gent briefly appears with a red monkey wrench and bolt cutters08.02 The Gent emerges again with a black bucket of tools. Mr Montana and Mr Strong come up and put the tools in a bag08.05 CCTV gives a first glimpse of the Old Man, a grey-haired gang member, who emerges from the side doorA white van used in the Hatton Garden raid (Met Police/PA)08.12 The white transit van pulls up in the alley. The gang load it with tools and drive off. Saturday is a normal working day and the streets around Hatton Garden will be busier than on Good Friday and Easter Sunday. The gang are not seen again on CCTV for 38 hoursMr Ginger is back, again wearing latex gloves and carrying a black bin bag22.32 CCTV captures a first glimpse of the Tall Man. He wears a flat cap and carries a blue Nike bag and a red tool box. The Old Man joins him. No other gang members are seen and for the next seven hours the gang drill through the vault walls, forcing open up to 70 safe deposit boxes05.46, Sunday April 5 The Tall Man, wearing an adidas top, emerges from the fire exit door carrying two red tools06.01 Mr Ginger, the Tall Man and the Old Man drag a wheelie bin outside.

Five Houthis and two local fighters died, residents said.Locals said Houthi forces were shelling civilian areas and trying to push into the Tawahi district, one of the only areas where they have no presence and home to a presidential palace and the city's military port.While the Houthis deny getting help from Shi'ite Iran and say their armed campaign is designed to stamp out corruption and Sunni al Qaeda militants, Saudi Arabia and its allies describe them as an Iranian-backed threat to regional security.The United Nations says the conflict, in which the Houthis seized the capital Sanaa in northern Yemen in September, has killed 600 people, wounded 2,200 and displaced 100,000 others.Saudi Arabia's Defence Ministry statement said more than 500 Houthis had also been killed in fighting on Yemen's border with the kingdom since the conflict began, but it did not say how it arrived at that figure.
A transplant survivor has honoured a promise to his bone marrow donor almost one quarter of a century later – by inviting his lifesaver to watch him walk his daughter down the aisle.Sales manager, Ian Brown, 59, from Morpeth in Northumberland, saved Rick Haines’ life by donating bone marrow to him in 1991.Thanks to the donation, Mr Haines will be able to see his daughter Marissa, now 27, get married next month.Mr Brown said: “Before his bone marrow transplant, Rick had little chance of survival and his greatest sorrow was that he would never have the opportunity to walk his little girl – who was four at the time - down the aisle.“He asked me many years ago as to how he could ever repay me for donating the bone marrow that saved his life, and my answer was to let me see that very thing happen.”Next month Mr Brown and his wife will attend the wedding in the United States as very special guests.He joined the Anthony Nolan register in the late 1980s when his baby son Michael - now 33 - was being treated for cancer.A few years later, in 1991, he received a call to tell him that he was a match for a patient in the USA who was in desperate need of a transplant.Mr Brown agreed to donate and travelled to the Harley Street Clinic in London to make the lifesaving donation.He gave his bone marrow on the morning of May 17, 1991, and it was immediately picked up by a courier who flew over to the USA on Concorde, on a journey of more than 3,500 miles, which allowed the patient to have his transplant that evening.Mr Brown said: “It was so rewarding – after making the donation, I went round with a huge smile on my face for six months.”Following the donation, the sales manager learned that his bone marrow had gone to a 44-year-old man called Rick Haines who lived in Delaware and who was suffering from aplastic anaemia.Afterwards, Mr Haines, an engineer in the motor industry, contacted Mr Brown to thank him.Mr Haines, now 68, explained that he had feared he would not live to see his young daughter walk down the aisle, and a deal was struck.• Donor organs from cancer patients should be transplanted despite risks• People who agree to donate their organs could be given NHS priorityThe men met for the first time in 1996 when the Browns flew out to America, and have since had family holidays together.Now, Mr Brown will fly to Pennsylvania to see Mr Haines' daughter Marissa marry her fiancé Dustin on May 9.The sales manager, who was widowed in 2011, will be marrying his partner, Lorraine Scott, in Durham the week before so will be attending the wedding as part of their honeymoon.Mr Brown said: “It is like a completion of the story. I am quite an emotional person and I am sure it will be an amazing moment to see Rick walk down the aisle with Marissa after all of these years.”Around 2,000 people in the UK need a bone marrow transplant from a stranger each year, often as a result of blood cancers such as leukaemia, and other disorders which affect the blood.Around one quarter of people have the same tissue type as a sibling, but the majority of patients need a donation from a stranger.Most donations take place via a four-hour outpatient appointment, with a machine withdrawing blood from one arm, separating the stem cells, and returning the blood through the other arm.In 10 per cent of cases the stem cells are taken from the bone marrow in the hip; this is done under general anaesthetic.The difficulty is finding a match: only one in 1,200 people who join the register get asked to donate, rising to one in 300 for young men.Last year a young bride-to-be launched a desperate appeal to find her fiancé a life-saving stem cell donor in just 60 days as he battled leukaemia, and found a match after seeing her campaign go viral on social media.Kate Robertson launched the Shake4mike appeal in her race against the clock to source a donor for Mike Brandon.The pair had just two months to find a donor after being told Mr Brandon must undergo a transplant as soon as he had finished his next course of chemotherapy.Anthony Nolan, the world’s first bone marrow register, has been matching donors to patients for more than four decades.The charity is urgently seeking more young men aged 16-30 to sign up, as they are most likely to be chosen to donate but make up just 15 per cent of the register.In 2013 a 17-year-old sixth former became the youngest ever donor to register on their list.Currently, only 60 per cent of transplant recipients receive the best possible match, dropping to just 21 per cent among those of a black, Asian or ethnic minority background, the charity’s figures show.If you are aged 16 to 30 and in good health, you can join the Anthony Nolan register here.
When Zara Phillips found husband Mike Tindall had bought a quarter share in racehorse Monbeg Dude at an auction in 2010 she reportedly called him an "idiot".The horse cost former England rugby international Tindall and three friends £12,000 but turned out to be a poor jumper of fences.However, Ms Phillips, daughter of the Princess Royal and an Olympic equestrian competitor, changed her mind after spending some time training the horse. And Tindall’s luck was in as the horse romped home in third place at the Grand National , netting £105,500 in prize money.Winning the Grand National is a feat which neither the Queen nor the late Queen Mother, both successful racing horse owners, have achieved.The only occasion on which a Royal has won the National was back in 1900 when the Prince of Wales's horse, Ambush II was victorious.A number of other famous names have owned the National winner including comedian Freddie Starr (Miinnehoma, 1994) and Anne, the Duchess of Westminster, (Last Suspect, 1985).The National also proved to be a historic day for jockey Leighton Aspell who rode Pineau de Re to victory last year.Aspell achieved a remarkable back to back victory, winning the world-famous race for a second year in a row on Many Clouds and landing the prize money of £561,300.The 38-year-old, who once retired from the saddle, held off Saint Are by a length and three-quarters.Aspell said after the race: “That was awesome. Many Clouds is a tired boy, he gave his all like he always does but what a wonderful ride round. It was all guts.”Much loved veteran jockey Tony McCoy came in fifth on Shutthefrontdoor in his final National, which was watched by an estimated nine million viewers in the UK and 600 million worldwide.While McCoy had his hopes of victory dashed, bookmakers were left smiling as they dodged an estimated £60 million payout if he’d won.Shutthefrontdoor ‘s trainer Jonjo O'Neill said: "He ran a blinder. He did everything right, he was following the right horses but unfortunately he wasn't good enough on the day and maybe he didn't get the trip."It's good news, at least I've got AP (McCoy) for a couple more weeks (before retirement)."Overall, up to £165 million worth of bets were estimated to have been placed on the Grand National. Bookmaker William Hill said it would be paying out £13 million to the 200,000 lucky punters who backed Many Clouds, which returned at odds of 25/1.Aspell’s victory marked the first time that a jockey had won two Nationals in a row since Brian Fletcher triumphed on the legendary Red Rum in 1973 and 1974.The last time a jockey landed in first place two years in a row on different horses was Bryan Marshall who won on Early Mist in 1953 and Quare Times in 1955.No jockey has ridden the Grand National winner three years in a row and William Hill promptly offered odds of 14/1 that Aspell does it again next year.Aspell had retired from racing at just 31 years of age in 2007, but changed his mind two years later. He’s not the oldest jockey ever to win the race – that was Dick Saunders at 48, when he partnered Grittar to victory in 1982.It was a third Grand National win for Many Clouds’ owner, Trevor Hemmings, who said: "Seriously, it was incredible. You come to the National and you dream that you win it."When a third comes along, that is something special. It is a wonderful, wonderful feeling."For years and years this race has captured my heart. What a wonderful feeling, you can't express it."Thank you [trainer] Oliver Sherwood, thank you Leighton and all the staff, and, of course, Aintree."Mr Sherwood said after the win: "I can't believe it. I thought it was a year too early and that Many Clouds might have gone over the top. What do I know about horses?"It is only the third time in history that an owner has won the Grand National three times.The first was James Machell who triumphed in 1873 with Disturbance, 1874 with Reugny and in 1876 with Regal.The second was Noel Le Mare with Red Rum in 1973, 1974 and 1977.Many Clouds was described as "wobbly" after the race and taken away to cool down but quickly recovered.All 39 horses were said to be fine following the tough race despite a number of falls and only 19 horses finishing, according to Channel Four which broadcast the race.There were protests by animal rights activists prior to the race, including from Animal Aid, a campaign group that wants to see the National abolished.A protester scaled the Gift Horse statue in Trafalgar Square in London on behalf of Animal Aid, and wrapped it in a banner reading “Horse racing: you bet, they die.”The director of Animal Aid, Andrew Tyler, said the daring protest, at 6am, aimed to draw attention to the dangers faced by horses racing in the National.“The green banner is representative of the green screens behind which race horses are shot on racecourses,” said Mr Tyler. “The statue, by Hans Hacke, was chosen because the skeletal sculpture reminds us of the horses who are victims of the racing industry.”Green screens were placed around one faller, Balthazar King. The horse survived and was reported to have been transported to a veterinary hospital with suspected broken ribs.Mr Tyler said: "Watching the race I was feeling so distressed. Anyone who loves and cares for horses is going to be deeply distressed by watching that. It's a wicked perverse spectacle that horses should never have to be subjected to. Balthazar King got up by pure good fortune, which was good news."
Like many other girls, all Lisa Gordon used to hope for was to marry a smart-looking guy who was dependable and had a steady job.When she met Keith it seemed her quest for a ­husband was over.He was ideal – older then her, ­sensible and an ­office worker who had a ­decent dress sense – the ­gentleman she was waiting for.But 14 years after they tied the knot she struggles to recognise the man she fell in love with. And she can barely stand the sight of him.Because in the past seven years Keith, 59, has become transformed from Mr Average to one of the most ­tattooed men in the country – ­covered in body art from head to toe.People stare at him whenever he goes out, which is tough for Lisa.Sensible: Keith and Lisa on their wedding day in 2002She told the Sunday People: “I would never have ­married him if he looked the way he does now. I always wanted a man who appears ­respectable and who the children can look up to.“Instead I look at him and I think, ‘What have I married?’“If I could get a magic wand I would wave it and take all the tattoos off. Sometimes I look at his face and try to remember what it used to be like when we met.”Lisa admits she treasures the ­moments when they are together with the lights out.“When we’re lying in bed in the dark I don’t see his tattoos.“I can touch his face and ­remember what he used to look like.“I feel like I’m sleeping with a monster in my bed.”Obsessed: Keith says his tattoos help him cope with OCDFor Keith, an admin worker, his wife’s refusal to ­accept the way he looks is hard to take. He said: “I don’t give a damn about what ­anyone else thinks about me.“The only thing that does upset me is Lisa not accepting my tattoos. It makes me sad.“She’s my wife and I do feel like she should support me. I’ve got enough haters.”He has suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder for more than 40 years and claims his tattoos have helped him cope with it.Long-suffering Lisa has stuck by her man because she can see the ­difference the tattoos have made to his everyday life.She said: “I don’t like them but I know they make him ­happy. Before, he was depressed and suffered with OCD. He used to make me mad ­doing OCD stuff. Now he’s a lot calmer and happier.“Perhaps I shouldn’t care, because it makes me sound shallow.“But I just can’t bring myself to like the way they look.”Annoyed: Lisa can't come to terms with Keith's new lookLisa, originally from the Philippines, can’t help looking back and missing the man she met during her lunch break from a cleaning job in London’s upper-crust Sloane Square in 2001.She said: “I’d had a bad ­relationship. I realised I ­needed someone different – a bit more ­mature, someone older, who could look after me.“Keith was totally different from how he is now. He was wearing a shirt and trousers. He looked like a nice, simple guy.”Lisa was 29 and Keith 46 but ­despite the 16-year age difference she was smitten.A month after they started dating, Lisa told Keith about her one-year-old daughter Diana Rose back home in the Philippines.“He was so supportive and I knew I could depend on him.”And when they married in July 2002 Lisa was five months pregnant with their first child together, Jamie-Lee, now 11.She said: “It’s so strange when I look at the wedding photos. It’s like I married a different person.“The personality isn’t different, it’s the same. He’s always been a nice, lovely caring guy who has tried to make me happy.”The couple, who live in Romford, East London, ­settled into family life and had two more kids, Ricky, nine and Jennifer, six. All four children's names and ­birthdays are tattooed on Keith’s ­fingers.Lisa said: “Having ­children was an obsession for him. He wanted to start a family. I think it was linked to OCD.”Recalling the ­background to his ­habit, Lisa said: “Keith was ­always into heavy metal but he didn’t look like someone who was. He went to work looking smart in a suit and tie. When he played his music at home I just went to a ­different part of the house.“He always had the rock T-shirts but he didn’t really wear them. They stayed in the drawer.” But after their youngest child Jennifer was born in 2008, Keith’s rock side ­came to the fore.He decided to get a tattoo – a skull on his shoulder.It was the ­beginning of the end for his straight-laced ­image as he ­became hooked on his inking sessions. Lisa said: “When he told me he wanted it I was shocked and angry. I just didn’t like them.“I worried about what my family would think.”But undeterred, Keith has gone on to spend £15,000 on body art in the last seven years. Only his ribs and stomach remain to be covered and his hobby has been costing an average of £130 a month.Lisa said: “Now I think it was all part of his obsessive ­behaviour. He’d had ­children and after that he needed something new to focus on.“When he had his sleeves done it was sort of OK. People didn’t react to that. But when he got his face done I would go out and feel embarrassed.”What ­puzzled Lisa even more was that Keith had tattoos as a ­teenager – on both arms. But he had them removed when he was 20 as his OCD kicked in. Keith said: “It was a mental health ­issue. I had to have them removed on the NHS and for years I couldn’t stand to even see a tattoo.”Decades later, and on medication for depression, his impulse to have tattoos roared back.Today it is not all agony for his wife. As Keith’s tattoos have got him more attention, she admits to feeling the ­occasional ­glimmer of pride. Lisa said: “I used to be embarrassed when we went out but now I ­support him.“If someone on a bus says, ‘Look at him,’ I will make it clear we are ­together. I don’t hide. I’ve realised that I need to be his wife and be a ­supportive shoulder.”There are even some benefits.Family guy: Keith with Lisa and their childrenLisa said: “At least he doesn’t look old. Before, he did look older but now he looks younger. My friends can’t believe he’s almost 60. They think he’s 30 or 40.”“Sometimes Keith will point to an old guy with grey hair and say, ‘Do you want me to look like him?’“That’s the only time I think he maybe looks better.”Despite her dislike of his tattoos, the couple are still very much in love.Keith said: “We’re totally ­incompatible but it works. We don’t like anything the same. I like heavy metal but she likes Engelbert Humperdinck.”And although she thinks his tattoos are ugly – Lisa still fancies Keith.She laughed as she said: “Sometimes I don’t understand myself why I’ve stayed... when you look at what I ­married and what he looks like now.“But we’ve been together 14 years and we do love each other. He only looks like a lunatic, but he’s not.“He’s attractive to me because he’s my husband.“He may be a monster but he’s my monster.”
VANCOUVER - Most of the toxic bunker fuel that spilled into the waters of Vancouver's scenic English Bay has been cleaned up, and crews have shifted their focus to clearing the shoreline, officials say.Coast Guard assistant commissioner Roger Girouard said a Transport Canada flyover at sunset Friday saw only about six litres left in the water and most of it likely evaporated overnight.About 2,700 litres of the black oil spilled on Wednesday from the MV Marathassa, a Japanese-made ship on its maiden voyage to pick up grain from Vancouver.The location of the leak has now been identified as the hull outlet, and officials believe the brand new ship built to the latest standards suffered a malfunction.Divers have been out each day to ensure that no further pollution has been coming from the vessel, and marine safety inspectors have boarded the ship daily, said Yvette Myers of Transport Canada.But divers are not testing the water and it is not known if any fuel has sunk to the bottom of the bay."That a small amount of oil might accumulate around some flotsam, a piece of wood, or something weighted, is certainly within the range of possibility, but we don't expect any significant volumes to have gone down to the ocean floor, Girouard said.He added work will continue for several days to clean up the beaches, where he says soiling is relatively minor despite a couple of spots where oil coated some rocks.Crews have visited and assessed several spots on the shoreline, including the south shore of English Bay near Stanley Park, as well as Sandy Cove, the hardest-hit area in West Vancouver.No marine mammals in distress have been found, but several oiled birds have been captured and taken to refuge. Girouard said the "small number" of affected birds is proof of the coast guard's "successful" response.The coast guard has faced harsh criticism for its response to Wednesday's spill, including from British Columbia premier Christy Clark and Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson, who called it "totally inadequate."While the initial report of pollution in the water came in at 5 p.m., the coast guard did not have an oil-absorbing boom in place until midnight and did not alert the city until 6 a.m. Thursday.Environmental groups and concerned residents gathered across the province on Saturday to call on Clark to pull out of the National Energy Board review process of Kinder Morgan's proposed Trans Mountain pipeline expansion.The expansion would bring more tankers, some carrying diluted bitumen, to B.C.'s coast. One environmentalist at English Bay called the recent spill an "absolute wake-up call.""The handling of that has been really concerning, that we aren't prepared to deal with a relatively small spill of bunker fuel," said Alexandra Woodsworth of the Georgia Strait Alliance."If we can't deal with that, how can we deal with a massive spill of diluted bitumen?"Kinder Morgan sent a statement calling the spill an "unfortunate situation" it is watching closely but said it is unrelated to Trans Mountain.
A convicted murderer who murdered and dismembered his teenage victim has had boiling hot water thrown over him in an apparent revenge attack in a Scottish prison.William Beggs, 54, known as the Limbs in the Loch murderer, was described by police at the time of his conviction in 2001 as a 'serial killer in the making'.Beggs is serving a life sentence in Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, for raping, murdering and dismembering Barry Wallace, 18, in Kilmarnock, Ayrshire, in 1999.The teenager's limbs and torso were found in Loch Lomond and his head was dumped in the sea off the Ayrshire coast.Beggs screamed in pain as boiling water was thrown over his face and hands in the cell attack, the Scottish Daily Record reported yesterday.The alleged attacker was due for release this year and has since been moved to Shotts Prison.He reportedly told friends he was taking revenge after Beggs attacked him soon after he arrived at the prison.It is understood Beggs was treated for burns in the prison's infirmary but did not need to attend hospital.Supermarket worker Mr Wallace vanished on December 5 1999, after a Christmas night out with colleagues in his home town of Kilmarnock.In 2001 a jury found Beggs took the teenager to his flat and subjected him to a serious sexual assault.He then murdered him and cut up his body.Shortly after the crime, Beggs, originally from Northern Ireland, fled to the Netherlands.After lengthy extradition proceedings, he was ordered in January 2001 to be returned to Scotland to face trial.After the High Court jury delivered their majority verdict and found him guilty it was revealed Beggs was once cleared of a similar murder by appeal court judges on a technicality.Beggs was jailed in 1987 at Teeside Crown Court for murdering a barman he met in a gay nightclub by slashing his throat, only to have the conviction overturned by the Court of Appeal, the BBC reported at the time.The court also learned that at the same trial Beggs was convicted of two charges of wounding and sentenced to four months for each.He was also jailed for six years in 1991 for slashing the leg of a man who escaped by jumping through a glass window.Beggs has repeatedly tried and failed to have his conviction overturned at the Supreme Court.
Yasiel Puig, who appears to be in an early-season slump, will be on the bench Saturday when the Dodgers take on the Arizona Diamondbacks in the second game of a three-game series at Chase Field.In the Dodgers’ first four games, Puig was two for 17 with six strikeouts.Puig’s second hit of the season came Friday night in the 10th inning of the Dodgers’ 4-3 defeat to the Diamondbacks.Following the game, Manager Don Mattingly said, “I think Yas looks a little frustrated, honestly. More than anything, probably just trying too hard to get a hit.”Andre Ethier will start in right field in place of Puig.Justin Turner also will make his first start of the season, as he will be at third base instead of Juan Uribe.With Clayton Kershaw on the mound, A.J. Ellis will catch.
Nick Suzuki and Isaac Ratcliffe have been friends for nine years.They have grown up two minutes away from each other in Byron.On Saturday, the Jr. Knights teammates were picked back-to-back in the OHL draft -- Suzuki 14th overall to Owen Sound and Ratcliffe 15th to Guelph, the Midwest division rivals who just happened to meet in the first round of this year's playoffs."We didn't have a battle going on or anything (about which one of them would be selected first)," said Ratcliffe, the 6-foot-5, 183-pound winger heading to Storm City. "We're just happy for one another. We really developed a lot of chemistry and it's going to be hard not having a guy like that with me (in Guelph)."But I'm sure we'll develop a lot of new good friendships and chemistry with other players over the next few years."London loomed at pick No. 17. The Knights took big defenceman Evan Bouchard, who scored 18 goals in 35 games this season with the Oakville Rangers. He and Victor Mete could have an offensive field day together next year.GM Basil McRae never got a crack at the two star hometown boys."I'm excited to be part of Owen Sound," said Suzuki, the skilled centre who was on the Attack's radar enough to go to the Bayshore last month to watch a game. "It would be great to play in London, but we're in the same division so we'll be playing the Knights a lot."It should be fun."Suzuki and Ratcliffe were vital parts of Ontario's Canada Winter Games gold medal in Prince George, B.C., this year. They capped their important minor midget campaign with a stirring run to the OHL Cup semifinal round."First, going to B.C. to play with that great group of guys was amazing," Ratcliffe said, "and at the OHL Cup, we really turned some heads and found a few shocked faces in the crowd. After our team did that, everyone was excited to see where they would go (in the draft)."Ilderton's Shane Bulitka was the top Elgin-Middlesex Chief, landing in Sudbury in the second round (28th overall). Aidan Hughes, the huge Jr. Knights stopper who had a great combine, went 34th overall to Sarnia.He was the second goaltender picked in this draft.Now, all of the 15- and 16-year-olds are back to square one again."The draft is so unpredictable," Ratcliffe said. "I wasn't expected too much and wanted to come in with a clear mind. It's up to me to go out, play next year and show myself well."I'm really excited to start my journey.The Knights, who need their top picks to show up after failing to attract Americans Zach Werenski and Max Jones the past two years, didn't get the two close buddies, but they grabbed their share of local talent.London picked Max Vinogradov, a super scorer, along with centre Alex Turko and defencemen Jordan Di Cicco in the first 10 rounds.1.

MONTE CARLO (MONACO) - While Andy Murray celebrates his weekend marriage, the rest of the ATP elite are girding for battle on the clay, with Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal leading the field as the Monte Carlo Masters which begins on Sunday.Murray, who moved back to third in the world after reaching the Miami final last weekend against on-form number one Djokovic, will delay the start of his clay campaign as he misses the European opening.Djokovic is riding a massive wave of form, with the Serb already winning the Australian Open and completing an historic third trophy double at Indian Wells and Miami.With his newborn son now on the road with the family and his tennis firing perfectly, the 27-year-old is totally content."It's just the beginning, I don't want to predict anything. I don't want to put some additional unnecessary pressure on myself," the Monte Carlo-based player said as the clay start drew closer."There is already a lot of expectations of course. Everywhere I go I have to deal with it."I could not ask for a better start of the season winning three big titles. Hopefully I'm able to use this for the clay courts."That's extremely important for me obviously leading up to French (the only Grand Slam he has never won).I feel good about myself right now on the court, and just going to take it slowly, one tournament at a time."Last year's finalist Federer is back after skipping Miami as a strategic move and getting in a training block at home with Austrian Dominic Thiem.Federer was beaten a year ago in the championship match by compatriot Stan Wawrinka, who won the title but has failed to solidify himself as a consistent top five contender.The Swiss takes the seventh seeding at the seaside Country Club.A major question mark has to hang over eight-time winner Rafael Nadal, the third seed who has not lifted the title here since 2012. Since winning his ninth Roland Garros ten months ago, the Spaniard’s only title was a small South American clay event in February.Nadal, his battered body now a constant issue, is trying to bounce back after poor hardcourt showings in the US, exiting in the Indian Wells quarters and third round in Miami.The 28-year-old has been back on the familiar clay at home in Mallorca and needs a deep run in the principality to help cement his fragile confidence.Canadian Milos Raonic takes the fourth seeding in a draw where the top eight seeds have byes.The big server is trailed by number five Spaniard David Ferrer, Czech Tomas Berdych on sixth seeding, with 2014 Grand Slam winners Wawrinka and Marin Cilic closing out the elite grouping.Missing will be Argentine Juan Martin del Potro, whose right wrist surgery comeback in Miami lasted for only one losing match. Japan's fourth-ranked Kei Nishikori is also not present.Frenchman Richard Gasquet is missing as he battles more back problems. But the French will have Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Gael Monfils and Gilles Simon in the mix.Americans have managed to actually cross the Atlantic, though the chances of hardcourters John Isner and Sam Querrey are minimal at best.Australian Bernard Tomic is back after wisdom teeth work while compatriot Nick Kyrgios is delaying his injury return until Barcelona next week.
PANAMA CITY - US President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro held unprecedented face-to-face talks in Panama on Saturday, ditching decades of Cold War-era antagonism in a historic effort to restore diplomatic ties.In the first substantive talks between leaders of both nations since 1956, Obama thanked Castro for his "spirit of openness," while the communist leader stressed that the negotiations will require patience.The talks were the climax of their surprise announcement on December 17 that, after 18 months of secret negotiations, they would seek to normalize relations between their two nations."This is obviously a historic meeting," said Obama, who spoke first after they sat down for their talks on the sidelines of the 35-nation Summit of the Americas.Obama declared that, after 50 years of policies that had not worked, "it was time for us to try something new."‎"We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future," he said.After Obama spoke, the two men stood up and shook hands.Saying he agreed with everything Obama said, Castro said the two government can still have differences but "with respect of the ideas of the others.""We are willing to discuss everything but we need to be patient, very patient," he said.The two leaders had already made conciliator speeches moments earlier during the summit, sitting in an oval table with some 30 other regional leaders.US-Cuban tensions have vexed Washington's relations with the region for decades."This shift in US policy represents a turning point for our entire region," Obama said.As the US leader looked on, Castro declared: "President Obama is an honest man."But both leaders acknowledged that the two countries, as they negotiate to restore diplomatic relations that broke off in 1961, will continue to have disagreements.Obama cited the human rights situation in Cuba, while Castro renewed calls for the US Congress to lift a decades-old embargo."I think it's no secret, President Castro I'm sure would agree, that there will continue to be significant differences between our two countries," Obama said.It was Cuba's first time participating at the 21-year-old summit.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos summed up the mood, saying "an old obstacle in relations between Latin America and North America is being removed."US and Cuba diplomats have held negotiations to restore embassies since January.Cuba has demanded to be removed from a US list of state sponsors of terrorism before embassies can reopen, noting that this has blocked the country's access to bank credit.Castro told the summit that Obama was taking a "positive step" by reviewing his country's inclusion on the list.The White House indicated that Obama was not yet ready to decide whether to remove Havana from the blacklist, but that it could not rule out an announcement in Panama.Obama has urged the US Congress to lift the embargo on Cuba, which was imposed in 1962, barring most trade with the island as well as tourism.But as Obama sought to turn the page on Cold War-era tensions, US tensions with Venezuela also took the stage.Obama left the room to head to a bilateral meeting with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, before Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro spoke to criticize him."I respect you, but I don't trust you, President Obama," Maduro said.He urged Obama to lift sanctions against Venezuelan officials accused of committing human rights abuses. The order has particularly irritated Maduro because it calls Caracas a US national security threat."I am willing to talk with President Obama about this issue with respect and sincerity whenever he wants," Maduro said.Maduro said he has publicly and privately sought to speak with Obama ever since the Venezuelan leader was elected two years ago, but his US counterpart "never answered the messages that I sent him."The White House sought to ease tensions ahead of the summit, saying it did not really believe that Venezuela posed a national security threat."The response has been forceful, rejecting the executive order and demanding its removal," Ecuador's leftist President Rafael Correa said."Our people will never again accept tutelage, meddling and intervention."
WOW FACTOR: Thomas and Emily McKenzie in an F-111 cockpit at Caloundra Airport during the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day. More photos on Page 42.THOMAS and Emily McKenzie were over the moon to have the chance to sit in an F-111 cockpit at the Queensland Air Museum Aero Engine Run Day at Caloundra yesterday."It was very squishy, but it was pretty cool looking at all the controls," Thomas said."I really enjoyed looking at all the planes, especially the F-111."The engines were pretty good too."READ MORE OF THE LATEST SUNSHINE COAST NEWSSeveral hundred people attended the event, which featured a jumping castle, a demonstration by the Eudlo Fire Brigade, Second World War jeep rides, as well as more than 65 restored aircraft on display.Dad Stuart McKenzie was as excited as his children to be at the show."It's always nice for kids to look at the planes, and for me as well," he said."It's a fantastic place, even if you're not interested in planes."It brings back lots of memories being here."The highlight of the event was when eight engines and planes were fired up at once.QAM president Cameron Elmes said the day was a chance to show off the engines in action.He said volunteers had been overwhelmed with the amount of community support."It's been fantastic," he said."We've been trying to make it a more family-centric event."If you want a history of aviation, this is the place to be - hopefully we can build an interest in aviation too."QAM marketing and promotions manager Geoff Smith said the vibe at the event had been overwhelmingly positive."It's a very happy day," he said.He thanked the 90 volunteers who helped out at the centre.
The killing of Walter Scott by a police officer in South Carolina was motivated by "overt racism", mourners at his funeral have heard.Hundreds of people attended the service at the Ministries Christian Centre in North Charleston to remember the father-of-four, who was shot last week.Officer Michael Slager was charged with his murder, after a video of the shooting emerged.Reverend George Hamilton said Mr Slager was a disgrace to the police force.He told mourners: "We will not indict the entire law enforcement community for the act of one racist."Mr Scott's coffin was draped with an American flag and flanked by members of his family as it entered the church on Saturday.Chairs were placed outside to accommodate the large number of people who turned out for the service.The 50-year-old was shot several times as he ran away from Mr Slager, who had initially reprimanded him for a broken rear light on his car.His relatives said Mr Scott probably fled from the officer out of fear of being jailed over missed child support payments.The shooting occurred as heightened scrutiny is being placed on police officer shootings, particularly those that involve white officers and unarmed black suspects.Tyrone Johnson, who went to school with Mr Scott, described him as a friendly person, who "never met an enemy"."There are a lot of people out here, just paying their respects to him and his legacy," he added.Mr Slager has been held without bail and faces up to life in prison if convicted of murder.
DARREN Bent admitted Derby County "weren't at the races" against Brentford - but believes his last-gasp equaliser could yet prove key in their promotion bid. Bent struck in the second minute of stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw for the Rams at the iPro Stadium on Saturday. Brentford had led for much of the match and missed several chances to kill the game off - and leapfrog their opponents in the Championship table. As it is, Derby remain fifth, a point ahead of the Bees, who are just outside the play-off zone with four games to go. While the Rams' automatic promotion hopes continue to fade, they remain in contention for a top-six finish. "We didn't play well but we've managed to nick a point," said Bent. "That point could be massive come the end of the season. "We weren't at the races but we should take confidence from the fact that we stayed in it right to the end and showed great character. "We know full well we weren't at our best but you've got to give Brentford credit, too. "They dominated large periods of the game and made it difficult for us. "If you look at the game, in the grand scheme of things, it's a fantastic result, because we could easily have come away with nothing."Follow us on Facebook and Twitter

Praise: Strauss has hailed Pietersen as the best player he's ever played withAndrew Strauss has put any personal issues with Kevin Pietersen to one side and revealed KP is the best cricketer he's ever played with.The former England pair didn't share a good relationship during their time in the international setup and KP infamously criticised his captain via text messages to South African players in 2012.Pietersen hasn't played for England since January 2014 but Strauss reckons, out of all the talented players he played with, that KP is the best."In terms of being able to do things that other cricketers couldn’t, in the England side while I was involved he [Pietersen] was the one guy that stood out for me," revealed Strauss on the Lord's podcast.However, despite lauding Pietersen for his ability, Strauss reckons the ECB will be taking a step backwards if they give him an international recall."It’s very important for English cricket to move on from the Kevin Pietersen situation," added Strauss."That threatens to envelop everything at the moment. The story has become more of a distraction than actually him playing or not, it's become that big."The ECB and England’s team efforts to move on from him haven’t worked so far, [but] by winning, that will allow them to move forward."If you look at it from pure cricketing logic, after this Ashes is over, it’s quite hard to see a situation where Kevin Pietersen would come back into the side."You’re building to the next Ashes in two and half years time and the World Cup in 2019."I think if you were to bring Kevin Pietersen back it would be a short-term measure to help you win the Ashes but I can’t see that happening personally because there are too many bridges to build in too short a period of time."
Gunmen have killed 20 construction workers in Pakistan's restive south-western province of Baluchistan.The men were shot at point blank range after identifying where they were from, officials said today.The area is plagued by violence, with separatists seeking greater control over the province's rich oil, gas and mineral resources.Gunmen have previously targeted outsiders seen as settlers."Armed gunmen stormed the camp of labourers in Gokh Don area of Baluchistan late Friday night and killed 20 labourers," senior police official Tariq Khilji told AFP news agency.He said those killed were all from outside the province, 16 of them from Punjab and four from Sindh province.The incident, which occurred around 1,050km southwest of Quetta, was confirmed by Akbar Hussain Durrani, a senior administration official in the province."The labourers were working on construction of a small local bridge," he said.Mr Hussain said some of the workers reported being woken from their sleep by the sound of gunshots and screams."They had lined them up and shot them at point blank range after identifying their identity," he said.He said paramilitary troops were guarding the workers but fled when confronted by a large number of armed attackers.Nobody has claimed responsibility for the incident but Mr Hussain said insurgents have attacked non-Baluch settlers in the area in the past.Human rights groups have long accused Pakistani security forces and intelligence agencies of serious abuses in Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest but least populous province.The security services deny the allegations and say they are battling a fierce rebellion in the province.
A gorse fire that was threatening thousands of acres of Killarney National Park has been extinguished.The fire at the foot of Mangerton Mountain had been burning since Thursday.The fire had spread over several kilometres due to the dry conditions.A spokesperson for Kerry Fire and Rescue told RTÉ News the fire was extinguished at 9.30pm last night.Around 20 firefighters deployed from Killarney and nearby towns Kenmare and Castleisland had been fighting the gorse fire.An air corps helicopter also assisted in fighting the fire, which is believed to be one of the largest to ever take hold inside the National Park.Hundreds of trees have been scorched by the fire and there has also been major loss, temporarily, of important habitats, according to the National Parks and Wildlife Service.In a statement, Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Heather Humphreys said she expects to receive a detailed report on the damage caused to the woodlands and wildlife from the NPWS next week.

Steve Bruce remains confident that Hull can stave off relegation, despite leaving Southampton off the back of an all too familiar defeat.Last season's run to the FA Cup final and Premier League safety is a distant memory for City fans as their side slide worryingly close to a Championship return.The latest blow came at St Mary's, where James Ward-Prowse and Graziano Pelle ended long goal droughts as Southampton withstood an impressive start from Hull to secure a 2-0 win.Sone Aluko proved a nuisance and Jake Livermore forced Kelvin Davis into a save early in the second half, yet the inability to capitalise saw the match play out in a way Bruce has unfortunately become accustomed to."Well, we expected them to be better," the Tigers boss said of Southampton."Livermore has hit a screaming shot from 18 yards where the goalkeeper, to be fair to Kelvin, has made terrific save and then we have given a poor goal away, which is not like us."When in the ascendency like we were, you have to score, you have to take advantage of that situation."Apart from the first half against Swansea, against Chelsea the week before that and today we've been in the game and given ourselves a chance."If we take one of them chances, I am still convinced we have enough to stay in this division but obviously we're in the fight like everybody else."Despite still hovering just above the bottom three, Hull are many people's favourites to get sucked into the relegation zone due to their unenviable last six fixtures.Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Manchester United all come to the KC Stadium before the season is out, while trips to fellow strugglers Burnley and revitalised Crystal Palace await."Listen, Sunderland today would be thinking they've got chance against Crystal Palace at home and get beat by four," Bruce said."We've got four games out of six at home and we have to win a couple of them, in my opinion, and might have to do a bit more than that."We've certainly got an opportunity no matter who we play against as we're at home."Going to Southampton, Swansea, Leicester, they're all not easy. That's why we're in the position we are in."We are finding it difficult but I'm still convinced we can beat three others. It'll be difficult but I still remain positive we can do it."Bruce had no complaints about the decision to award a penalty against son Alex, but was irritated that Pelle's forearm on him only warranted a yellow card.That decision allowed the Italy international to eventually end his long wait for a Premier League goal and wrap up the win, much to the delight of Saints manager Ronald Koeman."The last goal was in December," he said. "It's a long time ago."It wasn't a discussion, it wasn't a question how he is playing because he showed his qualities to be a strong target man, but if you are a striker you like to score and you need to score and it will help him a lot the second goal."The opener here came from England Under-21s midfielder Ward-Prowse, with the converted penalty representing his first-ever league goal.It was an impressive finish from the 20-year-old substitute and an opportunity Sadio Mane attempted to deny him, claiming the ball only to see it wrestled away from him."I was surprised because everybody knows if Proswey is on the pitch and normally Dusan (Tadic) and they are the first and the second choice to take the penalty," Koeman said."I had to shout to Jose (Fonte) to change that because it looks that Sadio was taking the penalty and Prowsey accepted that."I don't understand that because he knows the first choice. It was a difficult situation, a difficult situation, but I had to do it."That's the problem about Mane. The rules in the team are more important and nothing else."
PANAMA CITY - President Barack Obama and Cuba's Raul Castro sat down together Saturday in the first formal meeting of the two country's leaders in a half-century, pledging to reach for the kind of peaceful relationship that has eluded their nations for generations.In a small conference room in a Panama City convention centre, the two sat side by side in a bid to inject fresh momentum into their months-old effort to restore diplomatic ties. Reflecting on the historic nature of the meeting, Obama said he felt it was time to try something new and to engage with both Cuba's government and its people."What we have both concluded is that we can disagree with a spirit of respect and civility," Obama said. "And over time, it is possible for us to turn the page and develop a new relationship between our two countries."Castro, for his part, said he agreed with everything Obama had said — a stunning statement in and of itself for the Cuban leader. But he added the caveat that they had "agreed to disagee" at times. Castro said he had told the Americans that Cuba was willing to discuss issues such as human rights and freedom of the press, maintaining that "everything can be on the table.""We are disposed to talk about everything — with patience," Castro said in Spanish. "Some things we will agree with, and others we won't."And nothing is static, he added, noting that disagreements today could turn into areas of agreement tomorrow. "The pace of life at the present moment in the world — it's very fast."Not since 1958 have a U.S. and Cuban leader convened a substantial meeting. Dwight Eisenhower and Fulgencio Batista met that year, and the following year, former Cuban President Fidel Castro met with Richard Nixon, who was vice-president at the time.But relations quickly entered into a deep freeze amid the Cold War, and the U.S. spent decades trying to either isolate or actively overthrow the Cuban government.In a stroke of coincidence, Eisenhower's meeting with Batista in 1958 also took place in Panama, imbuing Saturday's session between Obama and Castro with a sense of having come full circle.The historic gathering played out on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas, which this year included Cuba for the first time. Although the meeting wasn't publicly announced in advance, White House aides had suggested the two leaders were looking for an opportunity to meet while in Panama and to discuss the ongoing efforts to open embassies in Havana and Washington, among other issues.In his brief remarks to reporters at the start of the meeting, Obama acknowledged that Cuba, too, would continue raising concerns about U.S. policies — earning a friendly smirk from Castro."We are now in a position to move on a path toward the future, and leave behind some of the circumstances of the past that have made it so difficult for our countries to communicate," Obama said.The flurry of diplomacy, which kicked off Friday evening with an historic handshake between Obama and Castro, was aimed at injecting fresh momentum into their delicate plan to restore normal relations between their countries. The two presidents sent shockwaves throughout the hemisphere in December when they announced the plan for rapprochement, and their envoys have spent the ensuing months working through thorny issues such as sanctions, the re-opening of embassies and Cuba's place on the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism.Although earlier in the week Obama suggested a decision to remove Cuba from the list was imminent, he didn't say Saturday whether he would move ahead with that step. The U.S. State Department recently concluded a review recommending Cuba be taken off the list, fueling speculation that Obama would use the occasion of the summit to announce the move.Removal from the terror list is a top priority for Castro because it would not only purge a stain on Cuba's pride, but also ease its ability to conduct simple financial transactions.Associated Press writers Nedra Pickler, Darlene Superville and Nancy Benac in Washington contributed to this report.Reach Kuhnhenn at http://www.twitter.com/jkuhnhenn and Lederman at http://twitter.com/joshledermanAPBy Jim Kuhnhenn And Josh Lederman, The Associated Press
Nairobi, Kenya: It was a week of reckoning for motorists in Nairobi as the county government and the Kenya National Highways Authority (Kenha) attempted to ease traffic congestion by introducing new traffic patterns that were praised and condemned in equal measure.The measures, targeted at removing roundabouts between Westlands and Nyayo Stadium, are in the long term being seen as the panacea to Nairobi’s perennial traffic gridlock. But as Eng Njuguna Gatitu of Kenha, a member of the committee entrusted with implementation of the new measures, admits, it was a week of hits and misses.“We have encountered challenges, but on the whole the measures are working. We have had success particularly with the Westlands section, but there have been major challenges around Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts,” he said.Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko on Friday dismissed the new measures and called for an immediate return to the roundabouts mode.Saying the changes had worsened traffic flow in the city, Sonko urged Governor Evans Kidero and the Roads ministry to rescind the decision or else “we will mobilise residents and they will wake up one day and find traffic flowing freely”.Although the new measures are targeted at discouraging drivers from making right turns at the roundabouts and compel them to drive further up the road to make U-turns, the decision created gridlocks at Bunyala and Lusaka roundabouts with the ripple effect being felt kilometres away.This, according to motorists and civil engineers, is because first, there was little public education about the measures and secondly, drivers were adjusting to the new traffic patterns on the go.“Motorists going past the two roundabouts reach Haile Selassie roundabout and are stopped,” says Njuguna. In addition, traffic flowing from Lang’ata Road merges with those at Mombasa Road and piles to a halt at Haile Selassie, creating a gridlock all the way back to the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport.There were snarl-ups running over 15 kilometres on Mombasa Road. However, analysts say these are teething problems and that the long term solution will eventually ease congestion.To resolve the current problem, Njuguna says Kenha dispatched a team of researchers to study the traffic bottle-necks on Mombasa Road — especially Nyayo Stadium and Bunyala — and implement new measures that include extended control by traffic police. “We asked police at Haile Selassie to allow longer times for vehicles coming into the city through Uhuru Highway. On Friday the scenes were much better,” he said.While the process of implementing the new patterns fall along trial and error, Kenha and the county government are pleased with how the new patterns have evolved and are calling for patience.
The Peoples Democratic Party appears to be leading in the governorship election in Ebonyi State, going by the result obtained in some of the polling units in Abakaliki metropolis in Ebonyi Local Government Area.Although, feelers from the rural areas indicated that the Labour Party was leading in there, especially in Ebonyi North and Central senatorial zones.“The PDP is purely leading in Ebonyi South senatorial zone from the results we have gathered so far. But the Labour Party is purely having it well in the rural areas in Ebonyi North and Ebonyi Central zones, which are the strong areas of the Labour Party candidate and his supporters gunning for seats in the House of Assembly,” a polling agent said.At polling unit 001 in Station Urban Primary School, the All Progressives Congress polled 19 votes; the LP garnered 43 votes, while the PDP had 171 votes.At polling unit 002, also in Station Urban Primary School, the PDP gathered 178 votes against 51 votes of the LP.The PDP got 190 votes at the Stadium Cover polling unit, while the LP and APC obtained 59 and 29 votes respectively.The PDP also led at Enugwu Ukwu Hall polling units 004 and 005, under Kpirikpiri ward. It got 26 votes, the LP got 19 votes and the APC got five votes.Due to the heavy rain that lasted in most parts of the state for several hours on Saturday, results in the polling units where Governor Martin Elechi voted in Ikwo council could not be obtained.It was the same situation in Umuebe in Ohaukwu council where the former governor of the state, Dr. Sam Egwu, voted.The polling officers in Ohaozara where the PDP governorship candidate, Dave Umahi voted refused to declare the results. According to voters who stayed behind, their refusal stemmed from the fact that the LP had won in most of the polling units.“They (PDP) never believed that the Labour Party could pull the weight here (Ohaozara) and this has led to the crisis in the area,” a voter said.However, at the polling unit in Eke Market Square, which is located in Ohaozara council, the PDP polled 83 votes against 39 of the LP. In another polling unit at Eke Market Square, the PDP garnered 80 votes against 40 from the LP.
The congregation raised their hands in worship as soloist Brian McClain sang gospel inside the church hall at the Word Ministries Christian Center, Summerville.“Don’t give up,” he sang. “You’ve got to be strong, stand your ground.” The crowd rose to its feet. The choir swayed in time. Images of 50-year-old Walter Scott, some from his time in the Coast Guard, others with his children and his parents, played on rotation on a large screen behind the altar. The stage was decorated with flowers, some shaped into a blue star, the emblem of Scott’s beloved football team, the Dallas Cowboys.Scott’s casket was draped in the stars and stripes. Members of his family sat close by.The small church, where the Scott family are regular worshippers, was full to capacity. Around 200 people sat inside, as around 100 others who could not get in stood outside in the rain. Those assembled were almost entirely African American.Scott was shot dead by a white North Charleston police officer, Michael Slager, last Saturday. The case initially failed to engage national media attention, with Slager maintaining that he had killed Scott because he feared for his own safety after Scott had attempted to take his Taser.But on Tuesday eyewitness video emerged, filmed on a phone and telling an entirely different tale. The footage showed Scott running away from Slager, who fired eight times, striking the unarmed Scott four times in the back.Outside the Word ministries, television cameras from national news networks lined the lawns.Inside, pastor George Hamilton delivered a sermon describing the presence of an eyewitness to the shooting as an act of God. He advised all those in the congregation to “keep your phone handy, keep your charge up; you never know when you’re going to need to be around”.Hamilton defended the North Charleston police department as an institution, but he said what the video revealed was a killing born of racial prejudice.“There is no doubt in my mind that Walter’s death was motivated by racism,” he said. “You have to hate somebody to shoot them from behind. This hate could not have been because of the person who Walter was. This hate was because Walter was an African American.”The funeral saw a relatively high police presence – for the purpose of traffic control, officers said. One Summerville police officer stood by the entrance to the church, seemingly assisting organisers with crowd control.Scott’s obituary, published in the order of service, described him as a man who “loved the Lord”.“He expressed it by singing in the choir,” it read. “He loved all of his family and friends and often embraced others as family. He was a true fan of the Dallas Cowboys.”Following the funeral, the South Carolina Democratic congressman Jim Clyburn told reporters Scott’s case should become a “catalyst” for change in law enforcement agencies around the US.“I think this is a catalyst to get people to face up to the fact that we’ve got problems in this country,” Clyburn said. “I think this exposed something that is already there.”Attorneys for the Scott family also addressed reporters. They confirmed, as has previously been reported, that Scott owed child support payments and that a bench warrant had been issued in his name. One of the attorneys, Chris Stewart, said it was the family’s belief that Scott had fled from his car after being pulled over by Slager for a routine traffic violation out of fear of going to jail over the arrears.On Saturday, local newspaper the Post and Courier published quotes from Scott taken from a 2013 interview in which he described being thrown in jail for 15 days 15 years ago, for a failure to pay child support. As a result, Scott lost his job at a film company.“I got mad at everybody in the whole world because I just lost the best job I ever had,” he told the Post and Courier. “I just stopped doing everything. I just closed myself into a little shell and started doing things I shouldn’t have been doing.”As the funeral on Saturday came to a close, the mourners walked in single file and slow procession to view Scott’s body. A soloist sang “I’m going up to yonder to be with my Lord” on a loop. It seemed to last for more than 20 minutes, as people came to pay their final respects.
Police have released dramatic footage of a high speed crash south of Brisbane late Saturday night, in which a car hit a pole, flipped then burst into flames.A 19-year-old man suffered a broken neck in the smash, which occurred after police attempted to stop a car in Yatala about 11.15pm.Police initially tried to intercept the Holden Commodore when they spotted it being driven erratically on Stanmore Road.Officers followed the car into a small residential street, where it then evaded both a police car and an officer who stood on the roadway in a bid to stop the driver.The police helicopter tracked the Commodore as it sped along Stanmore Road, where it ran a red light and narrowly avoided a collision with another car.Polair then continued to film as the car crashed into a pole at high speed, flipped onto its roof and caught fire.It then captured officers and passing motorists working to extricate the occupants from the wreckage.The 19-year-old passenger was the most seriously injured of the car's three occupants.The alleged driver, a man aged 20, and a 17-year-old female passenger suffered shock and bruising.All three were taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital with non-life threatening injuries.
Etisalat Nigeria has recruited a second group of 18 students from Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria for the Etisalat Telecommunications Engineering Programme (ETEP) internship at the company.Launched in 2013, the ETEP is the first MSc Telecommunications Engineering programme in West Africa.

AUGUSTA, Georgia - The biggest names in golf put major pressure on Jordan Spieth but the young American refused to crack, carding a two-under 70 on Saturday to take a four-shot lead into the final round of the Masters.Masters champions Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson and world number one Rory McIlroy all took turns trying to rattle the 21-year-old Texan, but Spieth held steady on a sweaty Georgia afternoon, setting a Masters record 54-hole total of 16-under 200 to better the previous mark of 201 shared by Woods and Raymond Floyd.Runnerup to Bubba Watson last year in his Masters debut, Spieth will again feature in Sunday's final pairing where he will be joined by Englishman Justin Rose, who emerged as a green jacket contender with a blazing back nine.The 2013 U.S. Open winner, 10 shots back of the leader on the front nine, collected five birdies over his final six holes for a five-under 67.Phil Mickelson also had a 67 to sit five off the pace while Charley Hoffman returned a one-under 71 to leave him six back.McIlroy and Woods were among those at six under after shooting 68s.The third round of the Masters is often filled with drama but with Woods, the 14-time major winner; Mickelson, a three-time Masters champion; and McIlroy, chasing a career grand slam, all on the charge the atmosphere around Augusta National was electric with possibilities as Spieth's composure was put to the test.Holding a five-shot overnight lead, the unflappable Spieth had threatened to run away with the year's first major, widening his lead to seven before a double-bogey at the par-four 17th.After carding just a single bogey through the opening two rounds, Spieth had three on Saturday along with his double-bogey, but also compiled seven birdies."I knew that something under par would be a good round," Spieth told reporters. "The greens kind of baked up and got quick and slippery."Obviously being four-under at one point in the round and closing it out at two-under is disappointing."Obviously would have liked to have finished the round a little bit better but also could have been worse."They are going to bring their game and I've got to have a relatively stress-free round going; and when I say that, I mean give myself some tap in pars and not have to make so many putts."Competing for the first time in two months after a self-imposed absence from the PGA Tour to retool his game, Woods flashed glimpses of the form that carried him to four green jackets as he joined McIlroy, Kevin Streelman (70), Kevin Na (70) and Dustin Johnson (73) in a tie for fifth, 10 shots back of the frontrunner."I've got to go out early and do what I did a few years ago, I shot 30 or 31," said Woods refusing to wave the white flag on a fifth Masters title. "I'm going to have to do something like that and continue on the back nine, at least give myself a chance going in the back nine."It's in Jordan's hands right now, he can run off and make three birdies coming in and put a substantial gap between himself and the rest of the field."But you just never know."McIlroy made a spectacular start with an eagle on the par-five second.On the brink of missing the cut with nine holes to play on Friday, the Northern Irishman grinded his way to eight under but stumbled with bogeys at the 16th and 18th."A disappointing finish," lamented McIlroy. "But overall felt like I played pretty well; and as I say, just a little disappointed the way I finished."
The hallowed halls of century-old Central Tech have many stories — such as the nude woman Leo Darmitz encountered on his first day of school.“There are a lot of great stories to be told,” said Darmitz, who graduated in 1960 and is the alumni organizer for Central Technical High School’s 100th anniversary celebrations.In 1955, Darmitz showed up for his first day of school but wasn’t pre-rgistered and found many courses at the school were filled.He and a group of other students who hadn’t registered were put into a group with no set time table.“At the completion of class, we asked where we were to go next. They just looked for vacant or lightly filled classes and sent us there,” Darmitz said.For third period of the first day, he and his classmates were sent to join an art class with senior students in a large studio with chalk dust covering the floors.There were no desks in the studio, only chairs which the older students propped upside down to mount their drawing pads.The teacher was not impressed the younger students didn’t know the drill, Darmitz recalled.His group of students were instructed to gather supplies and prepare for class.“Without any further introduction as to what to do, the teacher turned to leave. As he was doing so he said, ‘You know the exercise, get to it,” Darmitz said.“There was a moment of silence as the teacher left the room. Then the drapery that shrouded the small platform in the corner parted and out stepped a female model, completely nude.”Alumni at Central Tech gearing up for its 100th anniversary are working on publishing a 120-page book to celebrate a century of achievements and memories.There may not be an illustration of the nude art model.Central Tech has a long list of famous alumni that includes Ed Mirvish of Honest Ed’s and a patron of the arts, Johnny Lombardi of CHIN Radio and A pioneer of multicultural radio broadcasting in Canada, George Chuvalo the five-time Canadian heavyweight boxing champion and CFL linebacker Tristan Black who played with the Toronto Argonauts as a member of the 100th Grey Cup winning team.There is a long tradition of students at Central Tech excelling, said principal Lisa Edwards.“At CTS teachers, coaches and mentors look to find what a student is passionate about and develop it. This is just part of what makes students that graduate from Central Technical School so successful,” Edwards said.The alumni celebration weekend is being planned for Oct. 16 t0 18.To become involved, make a donation or purchase space in the book of memories, call Darmitz at 905-891-2748.
Those of us that are willing to follow after the order of this high Priesthood Jesus, we are also going to stand and say “Lord, here am I and with my whole body” Jesus said, “For me, I am come to do Thy will, Oh God.” Will you make such a choice? Will you come to that level of decision where you are saying, “Lord, I am come to do Thy will O, God”. In this church where you gave me an opportunity and a body to serve you with, it is your will I came to do. And I am ready to die doing it. I am not here to compete for popularity, I am not here to compete for strength, I am not here to compete for power, neither am I here to compete for people’s pockets. “I am come to do Thy will 0h God as it is written concerning me.” That will is to offer your body as a living sacrifice. That is what Jesus regarded as the will of God. The will of God for Jesus is not activities; it is the surrender of His body for God to work in.Your Whole Body… Rather than Sacrifices.This is another serious aberration God must deliver us from. Many of us keep our bodies intact for our ‘self-purposes’, while we look for some other things to give to God. Some of us give God gifts, money, etc while withholding our bodies for sins or personal ambitions and careers. We need to offer to God this whole body- mind, intellect, feelings, and all, for His activity to be done inside. God needs to sit inside this body and do His work.“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God; that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service”. (Romans 12: 1).Some brothers with good voices are presenting their voices. They seem to feel that God needs their voices, while the rest of their body is theirs – theirs to fornicate with, to live arrogantly with. So, we have so many good singers singing for Jesus in the church but their bodies are most undisciplined. They are in the choir. They seemed to have lent God their talents. They are playing the guitar or the organ and occasionally they draw attention to themselves using the instruments. They believe that there is nobody else that God can use. God is not asking you to present your voice. What does He want? It is when God takes possession of a man that his life becomes useful. When you are going to present your body, it means the man, the former occupant, with his personal programmes, desires, and taste, is no longer there. You must become a novice because the man that was using that body has passed away. It has to be Jesus who is going to now sit inside the body using the hand, the mouth, and the voice.That is why in God’s kingdom, it is not necessarily true, that because you were a music specialist in the world, that you can automatically become a music minister in the church. We see such people just after two months of repentance, already starting a music ministry for God. If things are to be done correctly, such persons ought to be sent to go and sit down yet. They will unlearn all the music they learnt, and then learn to humbly ask: “Jesus how do I play guitar for you?” Jesus could then decide that He did not save them to play the guitar. What actually their bodies are needed for is to sweep the church, since there are people who are already playing the guitar.There could be certain things that you know how to do before for the ‘flesh’, yet if you want to become useful to God, even those things will first be removed from your hands. This is because you used to do those things with your bodies for the old man. God will remove them from you first so that the old man can die and you can find your course in life. God is asking you to present to Him your body as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God. The Bible calls that your reasonable service. It is your ministry. Brethren, ministry is not preaching, singing nor teaching per se. Preaching, singing, and teaching, are all secondary assignments. Our ministry, our reasonable service, is being available for God to work in us. What you now see God doing in me is not my work. This is where the confusion is. Jesus never forgot that. He kept saying it.Pray that your eyes of understanding be opened!
It's fast and explosive and it's back. International boxing makes a welcome return to the Western Bay of Plenty in round two of the Clash of the Corporates.Anthony TNT Taylor will headline this month's Clash of the Corporates. Photo: Facebook.Following on from last October's success, the next big fight night is set down for April 18.Headlining a dozen corporate fights, is an International Professional Light Welterweight bout between Western Bay's Anthony TNT Taylor and an extremely experienced Thai opponent.The international contest, will be the main attraction fought over eight two-minute rounds in what should be an explosive contest at the QE2 Youth Centre's Memorial Hall.Taylor who fashioned an impressive nine win, one draw and one loss in the pay to punch ranks, has raw power in both fists, which should keep the expected sell-out crowd on its feet.At the last Clash of the Corporates, Taylor was in dynamic form stopping Taranaki's Daniel Maxwell in the sixth round of their New Zealand Welterweight title fight.The New Zealand professional title follows a decorated Amateur career, where the Tauranga puncher won two Boxing New Zealand Light Welterweight crowns.The highlight of Taylor's time in the amateur ranks, was to earn selection for the New Zealand Commonwealth Games team that took part in the 2010 Commonwealth event in India.However, the Western Bay pugilist won't be taking the challenge in the ring from Kru Chain lightly come April 18.The Thai pro boxer is a Muay Thai kickboxing veteran, who has had a multitude of visits to the kick boxing ring in recent years and has a reputation as a genuine hard nut in Thai kick boxing.While patrons at the event will get to watch plenty of action in the lead-up corporate fights – Anthony TNT Taylor won't want to leave the decision in the hands of the judges against Kru Chain and is likely to chase victory by the short route.
A display of community solidarity and support could not be stronger with dozens of volunteers rolling over 14,000 cheese rolls to support an Alexandra family.The Becks Hall, in Central Otago, was bustling with activity on Sunday - music blaring, pots stirred, cheese mixture poured, bread rolled and crates stacked.Ashlee Sutherland, of Becks, organised the fundraiser to raise money for Ashleigh and Peter Brown, whose 10-week old son Riley is battling the rare congenital disorder Zellweger spectrum.  Babies who suffer from the disorder - for which there is no treatment or cure - typically do not live past their first year.  Some community fundraising had helped the Brown family make mortgage payments and pay bills during weeks of hospital treatments, but the family was struggling.

We just sold more and more really."Volunteer Chontelle Saunders, of Alexandra, said making the cheese rolls was easy once they got into a routine."They are great friends and they would do it for us."
Blind violence in Yemen escalates as civilians caught in the middle of the war between the Arab coalition and the Shia rebels known as Houthis.Reports from humanitarian UN partners in different parts of the country indicate that some 519 people have been killed and nearly 1,700 injured in the past two weeks. Over 90 of the civilians dead are children.On Thursday, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator called all parties involved in the Yemen clashes to meet their obligations under international law and do their utmost to protect the ordinary women, children and men who are suffering the consequences of the conflict.In a statement issued by her office, Valerie Amos, the Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, said: “Those engaged in fighting must ensure that hospitals, schools, camps for refugees and those internally displaced and civilian infrastructure, especially in populated areas, are not targeted or used for military purposes…Before this recent escalation in the violence, millions of Yemenis were already extremely vulnerable. I hope that peace, security and stability will be restored as soon as possible.”Yemen was already suffering from years of internal wars and political upheaval. Before the war, more than half the population of the country was living in poverty. Water resources are dwindling, and the country has one of the highest rates of child malnutrition in the world. Now the living conditions for the citizens of the country became even worse. “It is a terrible situation and it is moving so fast,” Julien Harneis, the Yemen representative of the United Nations Children Fund, told The Associated Press. “We are heading toward a humanitarian disaster.”Harneis said 62 children were killed in the first four days of the operation — as many as were killed in all of 2014, when the Houthis were fighting to expand their hold. Some of the children were bystanders, and some were used as child soldiers, he said. Harneis estimated that about a third of the fighters on all sides are under the age of 18.UN repeatedly warned the international community that Yemen is on the verge of total catastrophe as the possibility of a civil war comes closer and closer. Yemen is also the home base of Al-Qaeda and according to the Russian news agency RT, amid the fighting between the Houthis and the Arab coalition, al-Qaeda militants stormed the center of the coastal city of Al-Mukalla and captured the local prison, setting free about 300 inmates, many of whom are militants.
A man drinks beer from a tower as his friends look on at a local open-air beer bar in downtown Ho Chi Minh City. At as little as 10 baht a glass, Vietnam has long been one of the cheapest places in the world to buy a beer and, recently, alcohol consumption has been rising quickly. (AFP photo)HANOI — Vietnam's growing thirst for beer is causing increasing health problems, from traffic accidents to various forms of cancer, local media reported Friday.With draft beer often cheaper than bottled water, Vietnam's per capita beer and wine consumption has almost doubled over the last decade, a health expert said at a conference to confront alcohol-related problems on Thursday.The global per capita rate had remained level during that time, Vu Thi Minh Hanh, deputy head of the Hanoi-based Health Strategy and Policy Institute, said at the gathering, according to newspaper Tuoi Tre.Vietnam has been SouthEast Asia's leading beer consumer since 2010. The Vietnam Beverages Association recently reported that 3.1 billion litres of beer were consumed in 2014 by this nation of 90 million people.Tran Thi Trang, deputy head of the Health Ministry's legal department, told the conference that alcoholic beverages had direct involvement in three kinds of cancer and seven other kinds of cancer indirectly.Heavy or regular alcohol consumption increases the risk of cancers including of the mouth, throat and colon, according to the US National Cancer Institute.In a separate interview with dpa, Khuat Viet Hung, vice chairperson of the National Traffic Safety Committee, said the growth of beer and wine consumption "relates to the increasing rate of traffic accidents compared to past years."The hazard posed by drunk drivers, Mr Khuat said, is most obvious during public holidays like Tet, the lunar new year holiday.In February officials proposed confiscating vehicles from drunk drivers, after fatal traffic accidents increased 13 per cent year-in-year over Tet.
Cape Town - South Africa and Egypt will fast track trade and investment between the two countries, President Jacob Zuma’s office said on Friday.Zuma returned to South Africa on Friday morning after a working visit to Egypt where he met with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi.The two men agreed that they would strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries.“We also discussed and agreed to accelerate trade and investment by urging our respective business sectors to utilise the many opportunities that our countries have to offer. In addition, the formation of the Tripartite Free Trade Agreement and the development of the North-South Corridor will boost regional economic integration,” Zuma said in a statement.“We also agreed on the need to partner on infrastructure development, linked to the ongoing NEPAD-related projects.”The two Presidents also discussed peace and security in the Middle East and North Africa.“We agreed that it is now urgent to find, through peaceful means and dialogue, a political solution to the crises confronting countries in conflict situations. In this regard, regional organisations such as the African Union and the Arab League have an important role to play in that process,” Zuma said.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has revealed some players are still recovering from their exertions in Townsville last Monday night.The Storm will be back on home soil to host the New Zealand Warriors at AAMI Park on Monday but the squad has spent this week recovering from an extra-time loss to North Queensland Cowboys in which the overheated Storm had just 42 per cent of possession and were forced into making 432 tackles compared to 338 by the Cowboys.Bellamy admitted he was forced to give star prop Jesse Bromwich an extra day off training on Thursday to aid his recovery while other players were being closely monitored to make sure they would be able to go the distance against the Warriors.Bromwich played 76 of 85 minutes, had 193 all-run metres and 42 tackles against the Cowboys."Sometimes there is no exact science to say if we have fully recovered because there are so many guys in the team," Bellamy said."Some of them would have recovered in the first two days but some of them probably hadn't quite [recovered]."With big Jesse we gave him Thursday off, to be honest. He played huge minutes for a front-rower on Monday night – I'm not quite sure how he did what he did and had the figures that he did."It was a quite phenomenal performance and it shows his standing in the game now."Bellamy gave his players a shorter training session on Friday, acknowledging the fact they have played three of their first four games on the road.The Storm have maintained their extended squad from last round with Tom Learoyd-Lahrs and Hymel Hunt joining the 17 who played against the Cowboys in the squad.Bellamy said he was yet to decide if he needed to bring any fresh players into the side to face the Warriors, something he will consider at the weekend."We have training today and we still have our Sunday session as well, so again our staff will keep a close eye on things," Bellamy said."If they think it's best to rest an individual or best for the team to make a couple of changes then we will do that."But at the moment we are not looking in that direction."The crowd for the Monday game is expected to pass 20,000 because of the Warriors' regularly large supporter contingent in Melbourne and the special holiday game.The match will also be former Storm second-rower Ryan Hoffman's 250th game along with his first visit to Melbourne since crossing to the Warriors in the off-season.Bellamy played in the NRL with Hoffman's dad Jay and made no secret of his love for the player and his family during Hoffman's time with the Storm.The coach will do his best to keep his emotions at bay when seeing Hoffman in Warriors' colours."Off the field Ryan was a great leader around the club and I always like that he had a bit of the old school about him," Bellamy said."As good of a football player as he is, he is a better person."I'm sort of building myself up to seeing him play in that different jersey – to see that at AAMI Park is going to be a bit tough on everyone, to be honest."Having said that, he will be putting his emotions aside for 80 minutes and we will have to do the same."The Storm play the Warriors at AAMI Park on Monday at 5pm.
South Sydney halfback Adam Reynolds is facing a long stint on the sidelines after sustaining suspected knee ligament damage in the Rabbitohs' heart-stopping 18-17 win over Canterbury.In a dramatic Good Friday encounter at ANZ Stadium that was marred by violent scenes in and outside the ground, Reynolds left the ground on crutches and wearing a knee brace.The injury occurred in the final minute of the game when James Graham caught Reynolds' standing leg as he attempted to charge down a field goal.Reynolds slumped to the ground in agony with Graham immediately alerting officials to his plight, before becoming incensed at the decision to penalise him, then award a penalty in front of the posts that was converted by Bryson Goodwin to win the game.The 24-year-old schemer has only missed one game since making his debut in 2012 and that was due to suspension but had a history of knee problems in his junior days.Coach Michael Maguire admitted the injury didn't look good with early diagnosis estimating a 16-week layoff which would scupper his State of Origin aspirations and place a huge dent in Souths' premiership defence."He's got a bit of pain in his knee, he'll have to get assessed by the doctors and see where he's at," he said."We'll have to see how he is in the week."The Rabbitohs battled bravely for the two points in a repeat of last year's grand final with both Glenn Stewart and Issac Luke forced off with concussion.Greg Inglis was also suffering with a knee problem in the first half but played the whole 80 minutes including a stint at five-eighth and also in the forwards."It's just an ongoing thing, it's what I have to deal with," Inglis said."We have really good medical staff here and they strapped it up and I was good to go."Maguire said the NRL have to find a way to help sides who lose players to concussion during a game and implement an 18th man system on the bench."The game has to look at having someone who can sit on the sideline and replace that player," Maguire said."(It doesn't matter ) whether or not the opposition team lose a player but can still put 13 on the park."If someone comes from the field, especially for a penalty it affects us and we need to look into that and have an 18th man."Stand-in hooker Luke Keary was outstanding for the Rabbitohs and Maguire said he was delighted with the young playmaker's performance."He did a good job, at time we were going side to side and the boys spoke about it at halftime," he said."But the boys dug deep to get the win."
A day after Dante Exum silenced his critics with a blistering NBA performance, star player Damian Lillard has described the Australian teenager's future as "bright".Exum was ranked earlier this week as the worst starting point guard in the NBA by US sports broadcaster ESPN, thanks to an underwhelming rookie season with Utah Jazz.But he responded in spectacular fashion on Wednesday night, tallying a career-best assist total to help the Jazz see off the Denver Nuggets 98-84.Exum made 12 assists for Utah – the most by any player in the team this season – along with a rebound and two points.It was a coup for the 19-year-old, who had zero assists in the past three games and has averaged just 2.3 for the season.Despite the tepid statistics, Portland Trail Blazers point guard Lillard said he can see the teenager's potential."I've watched Dante play, he's really young but he has really good size and good length and athleticism as a point guard," Lillard told NBA Australia."It's going to take some time, he went from playing against younger kids to playing against the best players in the world in the NBA so it will take time to develop. The future is bright for him."It has been a rollercoaster year for Exum after Utah selected him straight out of high school in Canberra with the fifth pick of the NBA Draft.While most rookies have spent the year on the bench, Jazz coach Quin Snyder gave the guard a baptism of fire."I had a good talk with coach yesterday and we've got a better understanding with each other and I'm building better relationships with my teammates every day," Exum said after Wednesday's breakout performance.Snyder said he'd seen "flashes" of Exum's fine form before, but he'd been waiting for more."It was appropriate it happened tonight," Snyder said.

A schoolgirl was left stranded at a busy airport after easyJet refused to let her board its plane - because she was carrying two pieces of hand luggage.Deva Joseph, 14, was reduced to tears at London Stansted airport after being told she would not be allowed to take her flight home to Spain.The teenager offered to pay for the second item to be put in the hold but was told only credit cards would be accepted - even though she is too young to have one.She even offered to leave the bag at the airport as she begged to board the 7am flight to Bilbao.But the teen, who goes to school in east London and lives with a relative during term time, said her pleas fell on deaf ears.The Daily Mirror quotes her as saying: 'I was sat on the floor crying. I just wanted to get home, but they didn’t care. I was desperate, I was pleading.''My phone wasn’t working and I was all alone. It was only thanks to a lovely couple that I could ring my dad.'She initially ran into problems when she was unable to squeeze her handbag into her suitcase. The plane left without her and she had to rearrange her plans to fly home the next day.Deva's father Stefan Joseph, of Santander, northern Spain, described easyJet as 'a disgrace'.The Daily Mirror reports that the airline has since apologised adding: 'Whilst our policy is not to take cash at the gate, we should have made an exception.'

Come to think of it, don’t mention any number at all.The Ukip leader had a tough time during the televised seven-way leaders’ debate on Thursday. Not just because he decided to bring up his old favourite argument about immigrants with HIV moving to the UK to get treatment on the NHS (a claim SNP head Nicola Sturgeon said he should be “ashamed” for stating). But also because he appeared to malfunction midway through the heated contest when the subject of Britain’s insurmountable debt came up.And it didn’t go unnoticed by the viewers at home, some of whom speculated that his circuit boards might have been held in place with a skin of wax, which appeared to be melting under the studio lights:Still, not being entirely human stop Farage being the leader who attracted the most mentions on Twitter:Or from Gary Linekar likening him to something very human indeed:
"Seen this man? Report to the security agencies through the numbers provided. #KaaChonjo #GarissaAttack," the Interior Ministry said on its official Twitter feed.The ministry also showed a picture of Mohamud in a poster.Somali militants burst into a university in eastern Kenya on Thursday and killed nearly 150 students in the worst terrorist attack since the 1998 bombing of the U.S. Embassy here, laying bare the nation’s continuing vulnerability after years of battling Islamist extremism.A small group of militants roved from dorm to dorm, separating Christian from Muslim students and killing the Christians, the authorities said. Students described being awakened before dawn by the sound of gunfire and fleeing for their lives as masked attackers closed in.Officials said that by the time Kenyan commandos cornered and killed the attackers on an upper floor, 147 people lay dead.Despite new security laws, significant Western help and a heightened state of vigilance that has already put police officers on almost every major street corner in the capital, Nairobi, Kenya remains squarely in the crosshairs of al-Shabab, the Somali terrorist group that immediately claimed responsibility for the attack on Thursday.Al-Shabab has killed hundreds of Kenyans - on country buses, in churches, in remote coastal towns and inside one of Kenya’s fanciest malls during a devastating siege in 2013 that left 67 people dead and rattled Kenya’s prized image as a cornerstone of stability in this part of Africa.The Kenyan government is so desperate to stop al-Shabab, one of the most violent franchises of al-Qaida, that some officials have even proposed building a 424-mile wall along the entire Somali border.Kenya’s tourist industry, one of the pillars of its economy, has been badly damaged by the terrorist attacks, and the bloodshed on Thursday is sure to make things worse. There are also fears that al-Shabab’s relentless emphasis on singling out Christians could inflame religious strife in a country already wrestling with tensions between a Muslim minority, which has complained about government persecution, and a Christian majority that increasingly feels under attack.The violence Thursday came just days after President Barack Obama announced that he would visit Kenya in July, his first trip to his father’s homeland since taking office. Obama had stayed away until now, at least in part out of concerns about Kenya’s public safety.The White House issued a statement condemning the attack and vowing to continue assisting Kenya in fighting al-Shabab - in recent months, the U.S. military has killed the group’s leader and other operatives - but it offered no indication of whether the university siege would change Obama’s travel plans.The Kenyan authorities said that around dawn the attackers stormed Garissa University College in the town of Garissa, about 90 miles from the Somali border. Though the college is in a predominantly ethnic Somali area of Kenya, it attracts students from across the country, many of them non-Muslim.In a statement early on Thursday, al-Shabab said that its fighters had attacked the university early in the morning, separating Muslims from non-Muslims in an “operation against the infidels.”In an audio message soon after, an al-Shabab spokesman, Ali Mohamoud Raghe, said the attack had been carried out because “the Christian government of Kenya has invaded our country,” a reference to the Kenyan military’s 2011 incursion into Somalia to oust al-Shabab from its strongholds.He said the university had been targeted because it was educating many Christian students in “a Muslim land under colony,” a reference to the large Somali population in a part of Kenya that Somalia once tried to claim. He called the university part of Kenya’s “plan to spread their Christianity and infidelity.”President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to crack down on terrorists and on Thursday he abruptly ordered 10,000 police recruits to report to duty despite a court order saying the recruits may have been selected through corrupt practices. Human rights observers have said that Kenyatta is trying to consolidate control and using the fear of terrorism to quash civil rights.On Thursday, panicked students streamed out of the besieged university with chilling stories of witnessing their classmates being killed. Augustine Alanga, 21, an economics student, said he had been asleep in his dormitory when the shooting began. He said he bolted from his room without stopping to put on his shoes, cutting his feet as he sprinted barefoot across the campus and into a nearby forest.“When I looked back, I saw them,” Alanga recalled. “There were five or six of them. They were masked. And they were shooting live rounds.”The authorities said the attack began when the gunmen killed two guards standing by the main gate of the university.Police officers nearby “heard the gunshots and responded swiftly, and engaged the gunmen in a fierce shootout; however, the attackers retreated and gained entry into the hostels,” a police statement said. “Security agencies arrived and are currently engaged in an elaborate process of flushing out the gunmen.”The police surrounded and sealed off the campus, and by 11 a.m., three of the college’s four student dormitories had been evacuated, while “the attackers have been cornered in one hostel,” the Interior Ministry said on Twitter.Kenya’s struggles with al-Shabab have been going on for years. In late 2011, citing a string of attacks and kidnappings, the Kenyan military charged across the border into Somalia, sending troops, tanks and aircraft to fight al-Shabab.The military later acknowledged that the invasion had been planned well in advance, part of an effort to protect Kenya’s borders from the violence in Somalia and to safeguard Kenya’s economic interests, including a huge port to be built just 60 miles south of Somalia.The incursion managed to dislodge al-Shabab from vital positions, but instead of pushing the al-Shabab threat farther from Kenya, it did the opposite: It brought more al-Shabab in.Al-Shabab’s attacks on Kenya since 2011 have grown in scope and lethality. Many people thought it could not get worse than the siege on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, a gleaming symbol of Kenya’s modernity, wealth and relative peace. But the attack on Thursday was by far the deadliest in Kenya since agents of al-Qaida blew up the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi in 1998, killing more than 200, the vast majority of them Kenyans.Al-Shabab began trying to affiliate with al-Qaida as early as 2009, but Osama bin Laden kept them at arm’s length when he was alive, and internal documents have revealed that he was uneasy about the group’s murderous tactics, including the indiscriminate killing of Muslim civilians. Al-Shabab did not become an official branch of al-Qaida until February 2012, almost a year after bin Laden’s death.Since then, the group has maintained that it tries to minimize Muslim casualties, though Muslims continue to be targets in many of its operations. During the shopping mall attack, gunmen separated Muslim from non-Muslim civilians by asking religious trivia questions (“What is the name of the Prophet’s mother?” “What is the name of his first wife?”) The “nonbelievers” were killed on the spot.In an al-Shabab document that was found in Mali by The Associated Press, the group tried to justify its tactics, saying that “all Muslims must stay far away from the enemy and their installations so as not to become human shields for them” and that there was “no excuse for those who live or mingle with the enemies.”
Olivier Giroud and Arsene Wenger have been named the Premier League’s Player and Manager of the Month respectively.The prizes came after Arsenal won all their four league games in March, beating Everton, Queens Park Rangers, West Ham and Newcastle.Giroud has been in sensational form, scoring against all the teams they played in the last month. In total, the French striker netted five times and provided an assist, to take the gong ahead of Tottenham Hotspurs’ Harry Kane. He becomes the latest Arsenal player to win it, since Aaron Ramsey scooped it in September 2013.It is however the 14th time Wenger will be winning Manager of the Month, but also his first since he and Ramsey won it.Arsenal will be hoping to start their April in fine form, as they host Liverpool at the Emirates in Saturday’s lunch-time kick-off.

Cashing in: Silvio Berlusconi is reportedly close to selling 75 per cent of AC MilanSilvio Berlusconi is on the verge of agreeing the sale of 75 per cent of AC Milan to a group of Chinese investors, according to reports in Italy.The Serie A club owner and former Italian Prime Minister bought Milan in 1986, saving it from bankruptcy and leading them to eight league titles and five European Cup successes.But now Gazzetta dello Sport claim that “the sale of 75 per cent of Milan to the Chinese has been agreed on”.The group of buyers is though to include Hong Kong businessman Richard Lee, who was seen watching Milan alongside Berlusconi at the San Siro in October.It is, however, believed that Berlusconi's daughter, Barbara, will remain on the board of directors after the sale.

Within the realm of food-centric holidays, Easter is unique in that the festivities tend to take place in the morning, with brunches laid out during egg hunts, the chocolate treasures reserved for dessert. Most leisurely pre-noon meals tend to be carb-heavy, especially when there are so many sweet, buttery, citrus-scented, fruited breads on bakery shelves. These delights are good for more than just toasting; they make an inexpensive foundation for fancy French toast or bread pudding. Or start with frozen bread or pizza dough to make simple pull-apart cinnamon-sugar bread that is far less finicky—and sticky—than cinnamon buns.Cut a loaf of good-quality day-old (or two- or three-day-old) fruit or raisin bread, challah or almond bread into 3/4-inch- thick slices. In a shallow dish, stir together eggs and milk with a fork, at a ratio of 1 egg to 1/3 cup milk (which is enough for 2-3 slices). If you like, add a few drops of vanilla. Set a heavy skillet over medium-high heat and add a drizzle of oil and a dab of butter. Soak each slice of bread in the egg mixture until well saturated, then transfer to the pan and cook until golden on both sides, sprinkling with cinnamon as it cooks if you like. Serves as many as you like.Divide 2 lb. thawed frozen bread or pizza dough into about 20 balls. Melt ½ cup butter in one bowl, and in another stir together ½ cup sugar, ½ cup dark brown sugar and 1 tsp cinnamon. Dip each ball of dough into the melted butter, then douse in the sugar mixture, rolling to coat completely. Place in a greased Bundt pan, piling them on top of each other. Cover and let rise for an hour while you preheat the oven to 350˚F. Bake for 45 minutes, until golden and springy to the touch. Invert onto a plate, then whisk together ½ cup icing sugar, 1 tsp milk and a drop of vanilla and drizzle overtop. Serve warm. Serves 8.Tear 8-10 hot cross buns (or the better part of a fruited loaf) that are at least a couple days old into a buttered 1-2 L baking dish (or divide between individual ramekins or baking dishes). In another bowl, whisk together 4 large eggs, 1/3 cup sugar or honey and 2 cups milk. Pour over the buns and let sit for half an hour to let them absorb the egg, or cover and refrigerate overnight. Bake at 350˚F for 45 minutes (30 minutes for individual puddings), or until puffed and golden. Serve warm. Serves 6.
Commodity prices were down 1.7 per cent in March and fell 19.7 per cent in annual terms, weighed down by weaker iron ore prices.Commodity prices fell by 1.7 per cent in foreign currency terms in March, figures from the Reserve Bank of Australia show.The fall followed a 3.7 per cent drop in February and brought the annual rate of decline in Australia's export commodity prices to 19.7 per cent.The largest contributor to the decline in February was iron ore, coking coal and thermal coal export prices, which together have fallen 2.6 per cent in March and around 19 per cent in annual terms, the RBA said.
Garissa, Kenya, April 3, 2015 (AFP) -Grieving relatives were Friday searching for news or the remains of their loved ones after Somalia's Shebab Islamists massacred 147 in a university in northeastern Kenya.The day-long siege of Garissa University was Kenya's deadliest attack since the 1998 US embassy bombings and the biggest ever by the Al-Qaeda-affiliated militants, although the Kenyan government vowed it would not be "intimidated".Survivors recounted how the gunmen from Somalia's Shabaab fighters taunted students before killing them, including forcing them to call their parents to urge them to call for Kenyan troops to leave Somalia -- before then still shooting them.As the gunmen prowled the university rooms hunting down more people to kill, some students smeared blood from their dead friends over their bodies to pretend they too had been shot.The day-long siege ended with all four of the gunmen detonating suicide vests in a hail of heavy gunfire. At least 79 people were also wounded in the attack on the campus, which lies near the border with Somalia.On Friday, a huge crowd of traumatised and shocked survivors and relatives of those killed or missing gathered at the university gate."I am so worried, I had a son who was among the students trapped inside the college, and since yesterday I have heard nothing," said Habel Mutinda, an elderly man, his face streaming with tears."I tried to identify his body among those killed... I have to do that before the body goes bad in the heat.. I have been camping overnight, it is really hard, it hurts."Emergency workers set about collecting the bodies, while Kenyan soldiers patrolled the campus.Visiting the scene of the carnage, Interior CS Joseph Nkaissery vowed that the country would not bow to terrorist threats."Kenya's government will not be intimidated by the terrorists who have made killing innocent people a way to humiliate the government," he told reporters, promising the government will "fight back"."I am confident we shall win this war against our enemies."Hurling grenades and firing automatic rifles, the gunmen had stormed the university at dawn as students were sleeping, shooting dead dozens before setting Muslims free and holding Christians and others hostage.In the final hour before darkness fell, Kenyan troops stormed a student dormitory where the gunmen were holed up as blasts and fierce gunfire rang out.Hundreds of students -- many of whom escaped in little more than what they were sleeping in -- spent Thursday night at nearby military barracks, where they were fed and given clothes.Maureen Manyengo, a 21-year-old education student from western Kenya, said she hid inside her wardrobe after seeing several friends killed."I could hear the attackers telling my friends, 'Do not worry, we will kill you but we will die too'" she recalled."I could also hear them, saying "You will only be safe the day your president removes the soldiers from Somalia.'".Several buses were due to transport the traumatised students back to their home areas, while the bodies of those killed were being flown back to the capital Nairobi.Dozens of family members also gathered Friday at the main Nairobi mortuary to identify their relatives.The university siege marks the worst attack on Kenyan soil since the 1998 bombing of the US embassy in Nairobi by Al-Qaeda, when 213 people were killed by a huge truck bomb.The Shabaab also carried out the Westgate shopping mall massacre in Nairobi in September 2013 when four gunmen killed 67 people in a four-day siege.During Thursday's attack, Shahaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage said the killings were in revenge for the presence of Kenyan troops in Somalia as part of the African Union's force backed the country's internationally-backed government."Kenya is at war with Somalia," Rage said.Newspapers on Friday were critical that intelligence warnings had been missed."The attack was preceded by a number of intelligence alarm bells," The Star newspaper editorial read, demanding that such warnings must be acted upon.But newspapers also called for national unity in the wake of the killings."Even as we struggle to rise from the rubble of yesterday's attack, we must once again realise what the enemy wants to trigger," The Standard's editorial read."They want an internal war in Kenya, the kind of which will trigger destruction and blood-letting they would want to see," it added.
There was no Good Friday service held at the blackened ruins of St James Church in Brighton, but that did not stop dozens of locals making a quiet pilgrimage to the gutted building.On the first day of the Easter holiday, they stood behind a safety fence and gazed at the place they and generations of their family had been baptised and married.But few were truly shocked, and some were not truly sad.Even before the fire on Monday morning, the crimes of paedophile Ronald Pickering – who served as the church's parish priest for 15 years – had tainted many people's feelings towards it.One local couple who came to see the damage spent four decades as active members of St James. But they recently stopped going because of their deep disappointment with how the Catholic Church responded to child sexual abuse."It is very hard to give up your faith after having 60-odd years of going to church," said the wife. "But it was also hard going to this church."One of the couple's children was groomed by Pickering, but they said nothing was done when they reported their concerns. Instead after he suddenly fled the country, they said they were approached by a church representative who asked them for money to support the priest who was living in Britain."I told that person to get lost," the husband said.He wonders if the fire may help finally raze the ghosts of Pickering and those who failed to bring him to justice."If the church is rebuilt after the fire, it would have served its punishment to some degree."At 9.15am on Friday a church service was held for about 100 of St James' current parishioners at the neighbouring Star of the Sea Chapel, where the crucifixion of Jesus was marked with a Stations of the Cross liturgy.All seemed incredibly normal, despite the drama of the week. A toddler giggled through the silent prayers, as the generations of churchgoers joined each other in well-choreographed prayer and song.After the service, they spilled out onto the lawn of the chapel, just a short walk from the scorched skeleton of St James, which looked almost like a medieval ruin in the bright autumn light.Kevin Custerson, a parishioner of 35 years, said he was saddened by the fire."I know there was talk about [the] paedophile priest. That doesn't give anyone the right to burn down a church that is a lifeline of Christianity," Mr Custerson said."The church didn't belong to one paedophile priest. It belonged to the people."There is strong speculation the blaze could have been deliberately lit, along with two other fires this week at Melbourne churches where notorious paedophiles served.
A French rescue worker inspects the debris from the Germanwings Airbus A320 at the site of the crash, near Seyne-les-Alpes, French Alps. Picture: Gonzalo FuentesParis - France BEA's aviation investigators said on Friday a second black box recovered from the Germanwings crash site indicated that the copilot deliberately crashed the airplane.“A first reading shows that the pilot in the cockpit used the automatic pilot to put the airplane on a descent towards an altitude of 100 feet,” the BEA investigation office said in a statement.
The incident happened in Bridgemary Park, in Bridgemary Avenue, Gosport on Monday at around 1pm.The child, believed to be a girl aged two, is thought to have received facial injuries from the bite.Police confirmed yesterday that they had received reports of the attack and they are treating it as assault and investigating. Anyone with information should call 101.
Along with classmates from Stoneyhill Primary School in Musselburgh, nine-year-olds Mason Renton and Katie Hannah were drafted in by wheelbarrow to help relocate snowdrops.Overseen by National Trust for Scotland Chief Executive Kate Mavor and head gardener Joshua Cook, the project was the first step in restoring the property’s flower garden.The work is also being carried out under the watchful eye of the trust’s archaeologists to ensure that the pattern of paths and flowers beds uncovered during recent research digs were not disturbed. Newhailes once boasted a beautiful flower garden but this fell into neglect during World War Two, at a time when many estates lost staff to the war effort.After that, the family could no longer afford to employ a gardener.The project to reclaim the half-acre garden is an ambitious one, restoring a rare example of a lost, but largely untouched formal garden that is hidden just below the surface.With the good photographic and documentary evidence and archaeological information the trust has access to, the plan is to accurately reinstate its former design using period plants from the 1820s to the 1920s.Ms Mavor said: “It is wonderful that, as spring finally seems to be arriving, we are here to start work to bring this once beautiful garden back to life. This time next year, it will be a very different spot, as the garden paths and flowers beds will be starting to take shape - adding not only to the visitor’s experience but providing an opportunity to see ‘conservation in action’ and even get involved in some of our efforts.“Although it may be difficult to imagine today, the designed landscape at Newhailes is of international significance.”The project is supported by the People’s Postcode Lottery, and is part of a wider programme of improvements planned at Newhailes this year. Property manager Rhiannon Naismith said: “We’re breathing new life into Newhailes this year – as well as the flower garden, we’re in the midst of restoring our historic glasshouse and doocot.”A new programme of family-friendly house tours and exhibitions starts with the Cadbury Easter Egg Trail from April 3 to 6 , from 11am until 4pm daily.

The ACT is helping lead the charge to ensure asylum seeker policy is front and centre at the Labor Party national conference in three months.And a new element has been injected into this dynamic with the appointment to the Senate of Katy Gallagher to represent the ACT.Around the country, ALP members are preparing motions for the conference, to be held in Melbourne in July. Some will target their anger at the parliamentary leadership's blatant refusal to follow the national platform on asylum seekers.The platform's 3000-word section on asylum seekers says "Labor will ensure that asylum seekers will not be punished for their mode of arrival" and that "asylum seekers who arrive both by air or by sea [will be] treated the same when it comes to the processing of their claims and access to support while on bridging visas".The platform also says "detention in an immigration detention centre is only to be used as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time."In a two-step process to change the platform and pressure the leadership to stick to it, the issue will be debated at the ACTU congress in Melbourne next month. That will focus national attention on the issue as delegates prepared for the ALP talkfest.And, as Labor then ties itself in knots - trying to balance the "more compassion" approach of stopping the drownings, over the harsh reality of indefinite detention - the Coalition will ramp up wedge politics, accusing Labor of being "soft" on border protection.The Coalition and Labor argue the issue is a border control problem and they are concerned about the dangerous sea voyage. hence deterrents like detention. Critics of this approach say the human cargo of the people smugglers are being treated like criminals.Gallagher has joined a ginger group within the party that is uncomfortable with Australia holding people indefinitely in detention camps. Last Sunday she put on a natty hat and a "ACT Labor for Refugees" tee and marched with her comrades at the Palm Sunday rally for refugees.The former ACT Chief Minister comes from the left wing which dominates the ACT Labor Party branch. However the ACT's two federal representatives in the House of Representatives do not come from the Left. How comfortable are they with Gallagher's position and the moves within the party for change?The hand-wringing within Labor on asylum seekers was created by the rush to harsh policies by Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard. According to some party members, the two prime ministers ignored the ALP national platform on this issue by promoting offshore processing of asylum seekers and mandatory detention.The ALP parliamentary leadership maintains these deterrents are necessary to discourage people from putting their lives at risk on a dangerous voyage in leaky fishing boats.As Gallagher told Fairfax Media after Sunday's rally, speaking out on refugee issues is fraught with political danger."I am uncomfortable with what is going on now, that's where I'm at," she said. "Part of my being here [at the rally] is to support other Labor Party people, we can advocate for change within the party."It's not easy and the political climate makes those discussions difficult, particularly when anyone speaking out is immediately portrayed as someone who is anti-Australian or anti-national security. But I don't think you would find many Australians who, if they fully understood what was going on in detention centres and offshore processing, would be that comfortable with how it is being conducted and the costs and the unwillingness to look at other alternatives."Her predecessor as Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, does understand the situation and is not similarly constrained about speaking out. He was the key speaker at the Palm Sunday rally in Civic and didn't mince his words as he criticised the ALP as well as the Coalition over the issue.Stanhope was the administrator of Christmas Island where many asylum seekers were held after arriving on boats. He says Australia has abrogated its responsibility to international treaties it had signed."More importantly perhaps even than the breaching of international accords, we have in our treatment of asylum seekers including children acted in ways that are not consistent with core Australian and human values of compassion, generosity, fairness, freedom, equality and common humanity," he told the rally."Australia has been found by the United Nations to be a country that has, through its asylum seeker policy, facilitated torture. In this contest, the furious race to the bottom, the ALP jettisoned the principled position on asylum seekers outlined in its national platform."It's time to demand that the Labor Party return to the principles outlined in the national platform including its stated total opposition to mandatory and indefinite detention and that the Labor Party construct policies consistent with the beliefs and the values which it boasts that it holds."It's time that all Canberrans demanded publicly and privately of all of our four local members and senators, that they stand up for the principles and policies that we elected them to represent and that we expect them to support."The left-leaning ACT Labor branch meets for its conference on August 22, where it will reflect on the debate conducted on the issue at the national conference. However the branch has already changed its platform to "oppose the mandatory detention of asylum seekers for the duration of their processing".The Victorian and Queensland branches have also adopted what members call "more compassionate" policies.In parallel to these developments, the Labor for Refugees group has sprung up in the states and territories as party members revolt against what they perceive as the parliamentary leadership's blatant refusal to follow the official party policy, as expressed in the national platform.That's where Gallagher believes she has a role, albeit minor, in the national debate. As Chief Minister, she expressed her concerns about the way Labor was handling the issue. Now, as a member of federal caucus, she has a greater say in formulation of national policy, and she intends to exercise this power, small as it might be.Indefinite mandatory detention is going on, with very little complaint from the Australian community.The Keating Government introduced mandatory detention, to try to deter waves of people arriving in frail fishing boats from Indonesia.John Howard continued the practice and locked up these "illegal" boat people in purpose-built prison camps in the Australian desert. Interestingly, water cannon was used on the inmates at one of those camps, something that has not been done against Australian citizens on Australian soil.Howard's mantra - "we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come" - echoed powerfully around the nation, resonating with many voters and becoming a war cry for ultra-conservative groups.Under his "Pacific solution", thousands of islands were excised from Australia's migration zone, the Navy was ordered to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers and those people were sent to detention centres in Nauru and Papua New Guinea while their refugee status was determined.The ploy was a political success - under his stewardship the boats did slow to a trickle.In Opposition, Julia Gillard promised Labor would end the Pacific Solution, but that's exactly what didn't happen.Kevin Rudd came to power promising a more compassionate approach and closed the Nauru detention camp. People smugglers restarted their evil trade, not concerned about those who were drowned on the way.Faced with hysteria over "illegals" and "queue jumpers" and falling poll numbers, he was replaced by Julia Gillard.In 2011 she proposed a deal in which Malaysia would take 800 asylum seekers from Christmas Island in return for Australia accepting 4000 refugees from Malaysia.The High Court struck it out, finding Malaysia was not legally bound to protect the asylum seekers. "Malaysia is not a party to the Refugees Convention or its protocol," the High Court said, a fact well-known by Labor before the deal was hatched.When Rudd returned to the prime ministership, he proposed the "PNG solution" in July 2013, asylum seekers arriving by boat without a visa would be refused settlement in Australia, instead being sent to the Manus Island detention camp and settled in Papua New Guinea if they were found to be legitimate refugees.After being swept to power, Tony Abbott returned to hardline messages to people traffickers and the boats again stopped. He says his government will not give in to 'moral blackmail' over asylum seeker suicide attempts. He said the reports of suicide attempts were "harrowing" but the government would not change its policy of offshore processing and no permanent residency for asylum seekers who arrive by boat.Despite Abbott telling the United Nations not to "lecture" Australia on any issue, the prolonged detention of refugees is contrary to the UN Convention relating to the status of refugees, to which Australia is a signatory.Although seeking asylum is not breaking the law, the Coalition regularly talks about "illegal arrivals" and this has become part of the furniture, especially when shock jocks canvass the issue.In the ACT, Member for Fraser Andrew Leigh gave a detailed speech on the issue last year in which he said about one in 20 asylum seekers who set sail to Australia die on the way. Labor's resettlement agreement with PNG and the earlier unsuccessful agreement with Malaysia were an attempt to stop refugees making the voyage.The purpose was compassionate - to prevent events like the SIEV X disaster and the Christmas Island tragedy from ever happening again - but it was undeniable the approach was harsh even when implemented well, he said. He favoured continuing with moves to try to stop the boats while restoring the annual intake of 20,000 refugees from UNHCR camps.Following the comments by Gallagher and Stanhope, the ACT's two lower house representatives were asked specific questions about the issue, including their support (or otherwise) for mandatory detention and offshore processing. Both gave general responses.Leigh said: "As a member of the federal shadow ministry, I support Labor's current policies on immigration and asylum seekers. These policies will be debated and renewed at national conference in June, and I'll be taking part in the internal conversation about that in the lead-up to conference."Member for Canberra Gai Brodtmann✓ said: "Federal Labor continues to support the policy of regional resettlement, which has proved an effective deterrent in stopping people from risking their lives at sea. Twelve hundred men, women and children have lost their lives on the dangerous journey to reach Australia by boat. I believe we have a responsibility to do all we can to stop another life being lost this way."I know there are many and varied views on this issue within the Canberra community, and indeed within Labor. I welcome the role that Labor for Refugees plays in representing some of these views and stimulating debate. I have the greatest respect for their work. I'm looking forward to being involved in what I am sure will be a passionate debate on this and other issues at national conference. However I am not going to pre-empt the outcome of those discussions."On mandatory detention, the current platform states that for management of health, identity and security risks to the community, Labor will strive to ensure this is for 90 days only. Labor for Refugees is recommending this period be reduced to 30 days in accordance with the practice of most member states in the European Union.The reform group urges children be placed into community detention together with their families and once health, identity, and security checks have been completed, they be allowed into the community on bridging visas while their refugee status is assessed.Labor for Refugees national co-convenor Robin Rothfield says the group wants to improve the ALP platform by emphasising more strongly the party's opposition to offshore processing. "Also to reinforce opposition to mandatory, indefinite detention," he says.He is "extremely disappointed" that the ALP parliamentary leadership is ignoring the current platform. "Hopefully the ACTU congress in May will increase pressure on the parliamentary leadership to abide by the platform," he told Fairfax Media.Labor for Refugees understands the Opposition immigration spokesman Richard Marles intends to abide by the party platform as determined by the ALP national conference in July.No doubt, that is a sincere promise but, given Labor's past performance, what chance is there the parliamentary leadership will decide to abide by the current platform, much less one with fewer deterrents?
Unite’s Regional Officer with responsibility for employees at the Roads Service, Gareth Scott said: “In the past week, Unite warned about the likely impact of the severe cuts to Roads Service budget but the reports we have received from our reps on the ground on Thursday, April 2 provides an insight into the difficulties being posed for managers trying to deal with the situation.“Planning which potholes will be dealt with is now happening on a day-to-day basis with only R1 potholes [the very worst category on major roads] being patched and only in the absence of six to eight square metres of such potholes will R2 potholes be considered.“Despite this fact, the client side are still marking R3 potholes but this is work that will never be done.”Mr Scott concluded: “We are calling on the Minister and wider Northern Ireland Executive to take immediate action to resolve this situation before it gets worse.”
Sia has released the final instalment in her music video trilogy featuring 12-year-old dancer Maddie Ziegler.Her Big Girls Cry video comes after two previous appearances from Ziegler in Sia's other film clips Chandelier and Elastic Heart where she controversially appeared alongside Hollywood actor Shia LaBeoufin a cage wearing a skin-coloured leotard and matching Sia wig.Ziegler, who uses only facial expressions and upper body movements in the new film clip, has now become synonymous with Sia's work, who has made the conscious decision to remove herself from her own film clips.The film clips all symbolise Sia's shyness and her battle with being in the musical spotlight.Ziegler's performance is arguably her best of the three film clips; her melodramatic movements are performed with the conviction and skill of someone many years her senior.
Data from the second 'black box' flight recorder belonging to the Germanwings plane that crashed in the Alps suggests that the co-pilot deliberately accelerated its descent, French investigators say.They say Andreas Lubitz modified the automatic pilot system several times to increase the speed of descent.The information they recovered also confirms earlier findings that Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane.The plane had been flying from Barcelona to Duesseldorf on 24 March.The second flight recorder, recovered on Thursday, showed that "the pilot in the cockpit used the automatic pilot to put the airplane on a descent towards an altitude of 100ft (30m)", the French BEA crash investigation agency said in a statement."Then several times the pilot modified the automatic pilot settings to increase the speed of the airplane as it descended," it added.Earlier findings from the cockpit voice recorder suggested Lubitz locked the pilot out of the cockpit.On Thursday, German prosecutors said the co-pilot had researched suicide methods and the security of cockpit doors on the internet the week before the crash.Germanwings also said it was unaware that Lubitz, 27, had experienced depression while he was training to be a pilot.Lufthansa confirmed on Tuesday that it knew six years ago that the co-pilot had suffered from an episode of "severe depression'' before he finished his flight training.``We didn't know this,'' said Vanessa Torres, a spokeswoman for Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings, which hired Lubitz in September 2013.The second "black box" recovered is the flight data recorder (FDR) which holds technical information on the time of radio transmissions and the plane's acceleration, airspeed, altitude and direction, plus the use of auto-pilot.Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said it was found near a ravine and was not discovered immediately because it was the same colour as the rocks.He said 150 separate DNA profiles had been isolated from the crash site but he stressed that did not mean all the victims had been identified.Mr Robin added that 40 mobile phones had been also been recovered and would be analysed in a laboratory, although were "heavily damaged".Lubitz began the jet's descent at 10:31 (09:31 GMT) on 24 March, shortly after the A320 had made its final contact with air traffic control.Little more than eight minutes later, it had crashed into a mountain near Seyne-les-Alpes.What happened in the last 30 minutes of Flight 4U 9525?
A Russian coder has revealed how he discovered a way to delete any video on YouTube.A demonstration of Kamil Hismatullin's technique, posted online, shows that once he had copied part of a video's web address he could use it to wipe the clip within half a minute.Rather than exploit the hack, he instead reported it to parent company Google, which gave him a reward.He joked, however, that he was tempted to wipe Justin Bieber's music videos."I spent six to seven hours [on] research, considering that [for a] couple of hours I've fought the urge to clean up Bieber's channel, haha," wrote Mr Hismatullin."Although it was an early Saturday's (sic) morning in San Francisco when I reported [the] issue, Google's security team replied very fast, since this vulnerability could create utter havoc in a matter of minutes in the bad hands."This vulnerability [might have been used] to extort people or simply disrupt YouTube by deleting massive amounts of videos in a very short period of time."It was fixed in several hours, Google rewarded me $5,000 and luckily no Bieber videos were harmed."Mr Hismatullin wrote that he discovered the flaw while investigating YouTube Creator Studio, a service that lets video creators see analytics data about the clips they have uploaded via an app.The facility allows any clip to be deleted if you type in both its event ID - which can be found in its web address - and a long string of letters and numbers known as an authentication token, which is supposed to act as a kind of password.The problem the coder discovered was that the service was accepting any token for a takedown request, rather than requiring one that belonged to the account of the person who had uploaded the clip.This meant Mr Hismatullin could simply copy a token from his own account and use it to delete others' videos.The developer said that he had spent time searching for vulnerabilities in Google's products after previously having been given a $1,337 (£902) grant by the firm.The search giant gives such payouts as part of a programme to encourage people who have previously reported flaws to hunt out more.The scheme puts a cap on subsequent payments, limiting the bounty Mr Hismatullin received for his findings."To be honest I expected $15,000 to $20,000," he commented."I wanted to write a kind of 'complaint' to Google, but first I re-read [its] rules and understood that Google could not pay me more."Facebook has not got a boundary for maximum reward, so they can pay as much as they want."
A Kilmarnock family-run business is celebrating after beating industry big boys at a top awards ceremony in London.Utopia Computers on Kilmarnock’s High Glencairn Street once again returned from London victorious after receiving yet more national recognition.The Kilmarnock company collected the Best Independent Retailer Award at the PCR event in London, giving them their seventh award in six years competing at this prestigious event.The PCR Awards were held in the Royal Garden Hotel, Kensington, last week and celebrated the best UK PC and technology companies. Utopia joined big name companies like Intel and John Lewis who all took home an award on the night.“We have seen great success at this event over the last six years, but that does not mean we ever take this type of achievement lightly."The award is judged by some of the most respected individuals in the IT community and this staggering achievement goes some way to show just how hard my team at Utopia are working,” said Mark Laurie, director at Utopia.“There are over 3000 computer stores across the UK, so to come up top for the 6th year running, well that’s just fantastic.“Kilmarnock has had more than its fair share of hard luck in recent years, I’m proud that Utopia has joined the likes of JS Geddes and GameCenter in showing that we have some of the best independent companies in the UK, right here in Kilmarnock,” said Craig Hume, director at Utopia.“Bringing this award back to the team was a very proud moment and now we are all working on how we can continue to innovate and provide the UK’s best service so we can be considered again next year!”Utopia Computers offers Europe’s longest warranties on its computers as well as lifetime technical support and a range of services to the public and businesses.
What is it?Vauxhall’s big estate, the Insignia Sports Tourer Tech Line, a big beast of a car that will take everything you can throw at itWhy is it important?The phenomenally crucial fleet market is always on the lookout for a new car that is as good looking as it is practical and so far this car has done tremendously well. It is the top selling mainstream car and if it is good for the fleets then it cannot be bad for the private owner.Will it look good on the driveway?Oh yes. This is a big boy with long sleek looks and a bit of chrome around the windows to give him a touch of class and style.Comfortable to the point of sighing. The driver is well looked after with good lumbar support and lots of adjustments for the seat. There is electronic climate control, cruise control, a leather steering wheel and things like wipers and lights can all go on automatic mode.And the information and sound system?Very intuitive and easy to use. There is DAB and USB as well as Bluetooth and Vauxhall’s IntelliLink system which works through a touchscreen and on which you can access apps. This is all about making life a scoosh for the driverThe Insignia Sports Tourer comes with the new 2 litre Whisper engine which makes the car sound as comfortable as it feels - the strong silent type. This engine gives you loads of power while reducing,noise to a minimum. Life on the road just became a pleasure.Six airbags, cruise control, tyre pressure monitoring, electronic stability programme, anti- dazzle rear view mirror. The list goes on.Anything else I should know?The Insignia has tunnel detection which is great news for those in Glasgow or Liverpool or anywhere else with tunnels. Then again it would be much more fun to take it to Mont Blanc and use the tunnel there.How much does it cost and when can I get one?

We all know that a dog is a human's best friend but this crafty canine may be a better friend than most.Baron, a German Shepherd, patiently loads the dishwasher collecting the dirty items from the side board and putting them into the machine.He was just six-months old when this video was filmed.But loading the dishwasher is not the only task the specially-trained dog can help with.The clever pup, who is a great help around the house, has also mastered loading laundry into the dryer.Baron, who lives in California is a service dog who is being trained by Linda Gonzalez, who developed his skills step-by-step.Linda, who is the founder and owner of Hill County K-9, a pet training service in Ocean Side, California, told the Huffington Post: "It wasn't too hard."She said: "He's pretty smart. Not only is he smart, but Baron's got a good attitude; he does it all with a courteous tail wag."Service dogs are specially trained to help in a range of situations from supporting owners with autism to helping someone in a wheelchair to pick up items they can't reach.Other videos of Baron show him helping his owner to work out.The intelligent dog sits on his owners legs while she does sit-ups making sure she can't cheat.This furry personal trainer joins her in doing step ups and supports her in her stretches.Linda has also posted other videos showing how the obedient pooch can go and fetch things for her.
A unique art exhibition has been unveiled on Anglesey, with giant canvasses displayed at the exact beauty spots where they were painted.The 2.5 metre-tall acrylic oil canvasses, dubbed 'Four on Anglesey' depict iconic views from the island.They were painted over the course of a week by landscape artist Anthony Garratt and hoisted on to steel structures.It is hoped residents and visitors will be inspired and do a double take.They depict views of Caernarfon, Snowdonia, the Great Orme, the Llyn Peninsula and the Irish Sea and will be on display until October.The paintings were commissioned by owner of the Menai Holiday Cottages Bun Matthews, who wanted a "unique" celebration. She hopes residents and visitors will do a 'double take' on the view.
Up in a penthouse room of the Silver Beach Towers, with its views down on to the beach, Scott McCain and his friends call out to the two holiday makers who must be distracted by the beautiful surroundings.At first the shouts of "SHARK!" (with some strong language) go unheeded, with the two vacationers waving the shouts away. Their body language seems to be saying "Hey what? Get away with you!"THEN they notice the shark.As someone in the room then says "Yeah! Now run!"Destin is a barrier island and one of the local information sites says quite clearly: "Shark attacks are extremely rare and, when they do occur, it is usually because the shark mistakes a person for something else."Nice and reassuring! In essence, we think this is saying don't go swimming dressed as other fish. The site continues: "You should never swim at night or at dusk, which is shark feeding time."This video was shot at around 9.30am. Eek, not quite so reassuring.
After some rain on Saturday, Easter Sunday and Monday will be dry with some sunshine and temperatures reaching up to 12 Celsius during the day, weather forecasters say.However, it will be chilly at night, with ground frost possible in sheltered places.Later in the week it will be sunnier and warmer but still with the occasional shower, the KNMI weather bureau said.
Councillor Maton’s letter (March 27) completely misses (or deliberately ignores) the point about the growth of Coventry’s two universities.I am not against the city having two successful universities, I have studied and used the facilities at both during my career. I do not believe that students should pay council tax, I put my own children through university and therefore benefited from the policy.What I am worried about is the growth of these two establishments to the detriment of the city. The two universities already occupy a huge amount of the land in what is a relatively small city and some areas of the city are virtually ‘student villages’, over-run with ‘multi-occupancy houses’ owned by absent landlords who care nothing for the city or its residents.For any society to function there needs to be a balance between those that contribute and those that don’t and that balance is now being skewed in Coventry.Coun Maton has on several occasions claimed that the university contributes vast amounts of money to the city. What I and a lot of others would like to know is how much and how the figures have been calculated? Where is all this wealth being spent? I can see no evidence in the city of it being spent here.The libraries are being closed down, Spencer Park is having its funding withdrawn, the pavements in most streets are a patchwork of crumbling Tarmac, the Transport Museum is facing cut-backs, the Godiva Festival is under threat and other facilities are being closed or cut back. Just who is better off?With the exception of JLR, Coventry seems incapable of attracting big businesses to the city and the landmark buildings that should be contributing in business rates to the wealth of the city are being sold off to the university, thus ending the possibility of any future revenue. We need a balance.If Coun Maton (March 27) is right in claiming that our universities are contributing millions of pounds to our coffers, can he tell us how this money is benefiting us, the citizens of Coventry?With all of that wealth, why are we suffering such swingeing cuts to everything that brings a little pleasure to life?Although I agree with some of what Clive Birch says (Letters, March 25) I fear his lengthy tirade directed towards Friargate is wasted energy.The image he refers to, as I understand it, is only meant only to show size and massing of the new buildings, and not the architectural designs themselves. This is the most common criticism I hear of the development, but it’s a misconception.With the recent genuinely positive news of the thousands of jobs being created in the city, my fear is this will not be reflected in the regeneration of the city centre.With the City Centre South redevelopment approaching almost mythical status, and with scant snippets along the lines of ‘it’ll be really great - honest!’ all we hear, my worry is that these new highly-skilled workers will choose to continue to spend their money at the more successful regional centres nearby.If the artists have finished with the AXA modern art installation they could turn their attention to the huge blue canvas of the Ikea blot on the horizon.As a project for the university art department, Ikea’s vast expanse of blue nothingness could be an artistic challenge. A swift paint job should present no problems, but not more flags of all nations please, there are a few of us still here paying the bills who are not students.Wow! What a brilliant and simple idea from Dave Cameron and Boris Johnson in last Saturday’s Telegraph.How clever to use up the spare brownfield land around Coventry for new industry instead of building on the green belt for the Gateway scheme at Baginton. Far too clever for Coventry and Warwick Councils and also some contributors to this letters page.May I take this opportunity to remind your readers that no matter how much they complain the only way to change things is at the ballot box.Statistics show that three people out of ten do not vote at a general election and seven out of ten do not vote at local elections but the people who have not voted are the most vociferous in their condemnation of the actions of those elected.Just think, three out of ten voters spoiling their papers would be a testament to the fact that the people have rejected all of the candidates rather than voted for one of them.
Referees boss Tony Archer wouldn't confirm whether the officials made the right call awarding a penalty to South Sydney in the dying minutes of their clash against Canterbury.Archer was reluctant to comment given Canterbury skipper James Graham was put on report for the collision that has left South Sydney's Adam Reynolds facing five months out of the game. However the referees boss said: "There can't be late, high or dangerous contact"."That's how they processed it. It's really difficult for me to comment ... because the player has been put on report for the dangerous contact. There is a process that has to occur in relation to that. Obviously in relation to the incident the referee took some action on the field. A player was placed in the sin-bin because of the comments that were made. No doubt there was some confusion about why the penalty was 10 metres out from the spot. It's not ideal but these circumstances do arrive in games from time to time."In one of the most extraordinary finishes in rugby league history, a controversial penalty against Graham cost the Bulldogs victory against South Sydney.Graham was fuming with the match officials after they penalised the Englishman for attacking the legs of Reynolds, who was trying to land a 45-metre field goal in the dying minutes to take the game into golden point.Reynolds suffered a leg injury in the collision and if it wasn't for the concern shown by Graham for the Rabbitohs No.7, the officials might not have called time out for video referee Bernard Sutton to inspect.It was brutal and gutsy, but perhaps undeserved was the best adjective to describe South Sydney's come-from-behind victory in the grand final rematch.The kings of clutch looked to have done it again when Trent Hodkinson slotted a field goal with three minutes remaining, only for controversy to overshadow one of the games of the season.Earlier, it was an old-fashioned ambush, and for a change it wasn't the premiers dishing it out.The Bulldogs produced a brutal and relentless onslaught on their arch nemesis, stunning the Rabbitohs with a type of performance that has become synonymous with South Sydney under the Michael Maguire regime.But an error and a brain explosion from Canterbury in the space of 30 seconds turned the game, and Issac Luke, on its head.Luke, who missed last year's grand final through suspension, ignited his team into action on the stroke of half-time, darting from dummy half to score.But the moments leading up to the Rabbitohs rake planting the ball on the chalk would leave Luke in Disneyland, Josh Morris on report and Adam Reynolds taking consecutive shots at goal.The video referee deemed Morris had lashed out with his boot, making contact with Luke's head - not that his skipper agreed."Can you look at the speed we're playing the game at," an angry Graham said to referee Gerard Sutton. "How's he supposed to pull out of it?"
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lined up talks with security chiefs Friday after Iran and world powers signed the outlines of a landmark nuclear deal despite strong Israeli opposition.Officials slammed Thursday's announcement in Lausanne of a framework accord as a "historic mistake", warning that if implemented it would jeopardise the Jewish state's very existence.Local media said Netanyahu called a meeting of his security cabinet and senior officials from Israel's security services."The prime minister will hold security consultations," an aide told AFP.Government spokesman Mark Regev told reporters in Jerusalem that the path to a permanent deal agreed in Switzerland was "a very, very dangerous direction"."This is a bad deal not just for Israel, this is a bad deal for the region and for the world," he told AFP."Iran's nuclear programme doesn't just threaten my country, Iran's nuclear programme threatens the peace and the security of the world."The framework deal clinched by Iran and the so-called P5+1 group of nations marked a significant breakthrough in a 12-year stand off between Tehran and world powers over its nuclear programme.Under the outline agreement, Iran agreed to sharply curtail its uranium enrichment capacity in return for the lifting of punitive sanctions that have crippled the country's economy.Regev quoted Netanyahu as saying that the deal as it appears to be emerging "would not block Iran's path to the bomb. It would pave it"."It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation and the risks of a horrific war," he tweeted late Thursday.Tehran has denied seeking a nuclear weapon but Israel has repeatedly warned that Iran's ability to obtain a bomb would endanger the entire region.Repeating previous Israeli warnings, Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said Thursday that all options were open."If we have no choice, we have no choice ... the military option is on the table," he said.Netanyahu travelled to Washington last month and addressed the US Congress, where he laid out Israel's concerns at an emerging world deal with Iran.The trip infuriated the White House and plunged US-Israeli relations to their frostiest for years.Shortly after the outline of the deal was revealed, Israeli government officials slammed it as "a historic mistake which will make the world far more dangerous"."It is a bad framework which will lead to a bad and dangerous agreement," they said on condition of anonymity.Under the deal, Iran's stocks of highly enriched uranium will be cut by 98 percent for 15 years, while its unfinished Arak reactor will not produce weapons-grade plutonium.The P5+1 group -- the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany -- hope that this, along with a reduction in its uranium centrifuge numbers, will make it virtually impossible for Iran to produce nuclear weapons.Israeli media was divided over the accord, with an opinion piece in the daily Haaretz calling it "not a bad deal at all"."Iran perhaps scored some victories in terms of the narrative... but the world powers made significant achievements of their own on the real practical issues," Haaretz said.The Jerusalem Post, in an article by British journalist Melanie Phillips, however, said the continuation of talks towards a lasting deal was a "terrifying situation"."The US has been prepared to allow a regime that is openly pursuing America's destruction and the annihilation of Israel to achieve nuclear weapons breakout capacity," she wrote.
"I'm just lucky to be alive today, and I'm just lucky to get another chance at life," Councillor Rob Ford declared Thursday after learning doctors will try to remove a cancerous tumour from his abdomen.The former mayor, looking tired but relieved, told reporters outside Mount Sinai Hospital that a four-surgeon team led by Dr. Carol Swallow will operate on him May 11.Aggressive chemotherapy and radiation did not shrink the tumour as much as hoped, Ford said, but doctors "are happy how the treatment went." A second smaller tumour "pretty much disappeared," he added.The operation is expected to last eight to 10 hours. He will be in hospital for up to two weeks and "out of commission" for about four months, with daily visits from health workers, said Ford, who hopes to return to work Sept. 1."I'm very, very happy and delighted. We're fighting, and I can't thank the people enough," he said, referring to hospital staff and people "from all over the world" who inundated him with well wishes."I didn't sleep much last night," he said. "I've been focusing on this. I have ups and downs every day, but when your life's on the line ... At least I have a chance."Ford, who next month turns 46, said Swallow is optimistic the team can remove all the cancer, but won't know until he is opened up. Asked if there is a chance cancer could return after surgery, Ford said: "It very well could," and he must avoid hernias, infections and other possible complications.Ford's wife, Renata, brother Doug, sister Kathy and nephew Michael were with him at the hospital. They planned to share the good news with his two young children.Last fall, doctors described the tumour in Ford's stomach as being about 12 centimetres by 12 centimetres. He said Thursday treatment shrank it to "5.6 centimetres by 5.3 centimetres by 4.6 centimetres."he five-year survival rate for pleomorphic liposarcoma is 56 per cent, according to the Liddy Shriver Sarcoma Initiative based in Ossining, N.Y. The rate drops to 39 per cent at the 10-year mark.Last fall, Dr. Walter Longo, chief of gastrointestinal surgery at Yale University, told the Star of someone in Ford's position: "If they can get all the disease out surgically ... he'll have about a 50/50 chance of beating it."Ford, who ended his mayoral re-election bid last fall after the cancer diagnosis and a term in which his drug scandal and frenetic behaviour made worldwide headlines, continues to make news.On Thursday, city council voted to accept his apology for past racist slurs, rejecting a proposal that he be forced to take an anti-racism course.And lawyers for Rob and ex-councillor Doug Ford were in court seeking to keep confidential, for now, documents tabled in an ongoing conflict of interest case relating to their city council votes on issues involving customers of their family label and tag business.
Police had to call a tractor to remove an Audi stuck on East Sands in St Andrews.Bemused onlookers spotted the seemingly abandoned car on East Sands on Thursday.Several photographs of the black car were posted to the Overheard in St Andrews Facebook page.It is not known if the car was driven onto the beach as a prank or if it had been abandoned.Police were made aware of the stranded vehicle but needed a tractor to tow it off the beach.Colin Wiseman said: "Lucky the tide didn't take it out."
A touring theatre company is intent on bringing a “magical” experience to one of the most historic spots in Angus this year.Chapterhouse Theatre Company is celebrating its 16th year of touring open-air theatre at some of the most beautiful country houses, castles and heritage sites in the UK and Ireland.This year the company will perform in more than 150 stately and public gardens, and it will come to Glamis Castle for a production of The Jungle Book on July 11.A spokesman said: “Rudyard Kipling’s best-known and most-loved story will be a guaranteed summer hit in one of the UK’s most beautiful gardens.“For this performance children are invited to dress up in their favourite animal costume and join in the Jungle Parade in the interval.”In 2004, the company produced the first West End show to tour open-air, ART, directed by Nigel Havers.In previous years, the company has toured with a variety of shows, including Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream and adaptations of Jane Austen’s Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice.Visit www.chapterhouse.org for information on how to buy tickets and other Chapterhouse shows this summer.
Anorexia nervosa is a chronic illness that affects 1 percent of people. Photo: AFPFrance’s National Assembly on Friday voted to ban the use of underweight catwalk models, in one of the latest measures aimed at fighting anorexia.The ban was proposed as an amendment to Health Minister Marisol Touraine’s health reform package by Socialist MP and neurologist Olivier Véran.Touraine herself backed the proposal that would stop model agencies being able to employ models whose Body Mass Index (BMI) falls below a certain level.Agencies found employing models considered too thin could be liable for a fine of up to 75,000 euros ($85,000) and six months in prison."The prospect of such a punishment will have the effect of regulating the entire sector," said Véran, noting that similar measures had been taken in Spain, Italy and Israel.Health Minister Marisol Touraine had previously said that young models should "eat well and look after their health"."This is an important message to young women who see these models as an aesthetic example," added the minister.However, the National Union of Modelling Agencies has complained this would affect the competitiveness of French modelling.The amendment comes after French lawmakers approved another amendment proposed by Véran that would punish people inciting others to "extreme thinness" to a year in prison and a fine of €10,000.That law was aimed at so-called "pro-ana" websites that some accuse of encouraging anorexia.The votes come two weeks after both of Véran’s amendments were rejected by a parliamentary commission with lawmakers claiming that banning skinny models would lead to discrimination in the hiring process.Up to an estimated 40,000 people suffer from anorexia in France, nine out of ten of them women and girls.
In supporting a call for improved staffing levels at St Patrick’s Hospital in Cashel at the March meeting of the Regional Health Forum, Cllr Tom Wood asked if the HSE is happy that the Agency Service supplying staff was a “safe service” given the recent national focus on residential centres and safe practices.In drawing a distinction between filling vacant posts and providing additional staff he said, ” while understaffing was not unique to Saint Patricks due to the moratorium on recruitment in the public service, now thankfully lifted, and dedicated staff at all levels were committed to providing the best service possible, they were under severe pressure and the matter required immediate action.”In response, Ms Anna Marie Lanigan, Area Manager, said there had been a concerted effort to hire staff in recent months and allied to that revised rostering arrangements and skill-mix had been used to gain efficiencies where achievable. The HSE management acknowledged the dedication of its nursing and support staff and would continue to work to maintain staffing levels and ensure that approved posts were filled as quickly as is possible in order to further reduce/eliminate agency.She continued, “ while every effort has been made to ensure that appropriate staffing levels are in place at Saint Patricks Hospital, Cashel, at times there can be difficulty securing agency replacement for nurses on short term sick leave. There is a nationwide gap between the number of available positions and the number of registered nurses qualified and willing to fill them. Notwithstanding that, the HSE continues to endeavour to improve direct employee staffing levels at Saint Patricks. Since September 2014 a number of staffing positions have been recruited and appointed. This includes six interm Multi Task Attendants and eight Registered General Nurses. In addition it is expected that two further Multi Task Attendants will be appointed shortly. On April 7th one additional Registered General Nurse is due to commence work at the Hospital.The national recruitment process is ongoing in relation to further permanent posts for Saint Patricks ie. 11.5 whole time equivalents. Interviews have been held recently to fill two Clinical Nurse Manager positions. In addition it is anticipated that interviews will be scheduled shortly for one Clinical Nurse Manager Grade 2 for the Rehabilitation Unit.”
Real Madrid’s signing of right-back Danilo from Porto spells danger for Barcelona, La Liga and European football heavyweights in general.Danilo’s capture represents good business but it’s more that Florentino Perez has got his cheque book out again and when Los Blancos’ chief goes shopping, invariably he gets what he wants.With Carlo Ancelotti almost certain to depart Madrid at the end of the season whether or not the ‘Undecima’ has been secured, any new incumbent (expected to be Zinedine Zidane) will want the club to have bought well in the transfer market.Danilo’s purchase certainly does add to the quota of elite talent at the club and at £23million, he has become Real’s most expensive ever defender. That’s a big responsibility but the player should take it all in his galloping stride.A marauding right-back in the typical Brazilian style, Danilo would’ve been the perfect replacement for Davi Alves at Barcelona.Indeed, the Porto player’s name had been mentioned in dispatches at the Catalan club, albeit January 2016 would’ve been the earliest that Barca could think about putting serious money on the table.He won’t be the first to turn down the Catalans this season either, for exactly that reason.In any event, what isn’t in dispute is that Real have acquired themselves an outstanding player. Danilo is a super addition to the all whites’ roster and Dani Carvajal now has genuine competition for his slot on the right side.Pace, power and a desire to get forward at every opportunity underscore Danilo’s performances, and he will certainly be a big miss for the Portuguese giants.Arguably Carvajal, the current first choice right-back, will face a fight to keep the status quo because you don’t spend over £23m on a player to see him sit on the bench.That’s tough on a player who has done little wrong since breaking into the Real senior side and the traditionalists won’t be happy at seeing another academy product just tossed aside in favour of a ‘galactico’ type signing.Yet Real’s template has never been any different under Perez so it’s hardly a surprise.And the president has to be seen to be doing something to alleviate the current dark clouds enveloping the Santiago Bernabeu.The wheels have almost come off of Real’s title tilt which is incredible when you think how many consecutive games they had won prior to the Christmas period.Announcing some ‘good news’ now is at least a decent piece of PR by the club, who aren’t generally renowned for the same.And once the locals see what the player has to offer, any initial misgivings supporters may have had concerning his purchase will dissipate.No, nothing with this deal at all…MORE: Real Madrid ‘are ready to make their move for Manchester United ‘keeper David De Gea – Spaniard is a primary transfer target’MORE: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho could make shock return to manage Real Madrid, believes Alvaro Arbeloa
A visitor centre at an internationally important nature reserve in East Yorkshire has reopened after a £1.3m upgrade.Bempton Cliffs at Flamborough Head has the UK's largest mainland seabird colony, according to the RSPB.It said the new facilities would bring more visitors and improve their access to the thousands of nesting birds.Keith Clarkson, site manager, said: "It's absolutely fantastic. It's been 10 years in the making."The centre, which attracts about 76,000 people a year, has been closed since September for redevelopment.It now has a bigger reception, a sheltered place for education and space for community groups and family activities.The footpaths have been made more accessible and extra spaces provided in the car park.Its reopening coincides with the BBC's Springwatch programme, which is based at the nature reserve for its Easter show.Springwatch will be on BBC Two at 21:00 BST.
Gov. Jerry Brown's historic order to curb California's water use largely bypasses agriculture, the state's biggest water user, setting off debate about whether growers are getting a pass.The vast majority of Brown's plan focused on urban water use — such as lawns, golf courses, parks and public medians — which makes up less than 25% of Californians' overall water use.For critics of Brown's plan, it's ineffective policy to crack down on watering suburban yards while largely ignoring the vast, still-green expanses of the state's fruit and vegetable garden."The government's response to this growing crisis has been behind the curve," said Jonas Minton, water policy advisor for the Planning and Conservation League and a former state water official. He argued that state officials should clamp down on groundwater pumping and plantings of thirsty new crops.Other water experts and growers say that agriculture has already suffered severe cutbacks as a result of the drawn-out drought, now in its fourth year. For the second year in a row, Central Valley farmers without senior water rights are expecting no deliveries from the valley's big federal irrigation project.Growers who get supplies from the State Water Project will receive only 20% of requested deliveries this year. Farmers left more than 400,000 acres unplanted last year, dealing a $2-billion blow to the state's agricultural economy."I think much of California is all of a sudden waking up to the fact that the drought is not theoretical. It's going to manifest itself in ordinary Californians' lives for the first time."Well, our farmers have been feeling it for a while," said Chris Scheuring, a water attorney for the California Farm Bureau Federation.Brown's seven-page executive order, issued Wednesday, outlined the first statewide mandatory water use restrictions in California's history.Among them: He ordered a 25% reduction in urban use statewide compared to 2013 levels. The directive also bans the use of drinking water to irrigate median strips in public roads, initiates the removal of 1,150 football fields worth of grass to be replaced with drought-tolerant plants; and orders golf courses, campuses and cemeteries to significantly cut their water consumption.Agricultural mandates were fewer and milder. Irrigation districts were directed to develop drought management plans that include supply and demand data. Agencies in basins where groundwater has been overpumped must immediately monitor groundwater levels. And the State Water Resources Control Board was told to crack down on illegal water diversions and "those engaging in the wasteful and unreasonable use of water."Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, said growers have been dealing with water cutbacks for years.As for regulating which crops growers plant, Mount said that could distort the market and have unintended economic consequences. "It's our view that government probably is not going to do a very good job of deciding what should and should not be grown."Moreover, Mount said that while the state could ban certain plantings under its constitutional powers to stop the unreasonable use of water in a drought, growing high-value crops such as almonds would not be considered unreasonable.The Legislature approved a statewide groundwater law last year intended to end decades of overpumping from aquifers in the Central Valley.But it won't take full effect for more than two decades, a timetable that critics say is far too generous. The rules are expected to limit withdrawals in some basins, forcing farmers who have increasingly relied on pumping groundwater to permanently retire cropland. Experts say change that significant requires time."You do that overnight and there is extraordinary disruption," Mount said."In some basins, this is going to be very painful, economically and socially, and you have to be careful about forcing that pain too quickly."Scheuring, noting that at least 40% of residential water use in the state is for landscaping, said that urban cuts don't have the same economic impact as slashing irrigation deliveries."Folks are still going to brush their teeth," he said. "They're still going to run their dishwashers …flush their toilets. It's just that their lawn might be brown and they're going to have make some hard choices about landscaping."That's a different thing from telling a farmer goodbye to 25% of what little [water] you may have. That has direct economic consequences."While farmers are moving to more efficient irrigation practices, they still practice wasteful flood irrigation on about 40% of irrigated acreage, said Heather Cooley of the Pacific Institute, an Oakland think tank. "We have a long way to go," she added.Phil Isenberg, vice chairman of the Delta Stewardship Council, said the sections of Brown's order demanding more water use data from agriculture are "a very dramatic change."Not only does the state lack information on all water diversions by farmers, groundwater pumping in the Central Valley has gone largely unmonitored for more than a century. "You gotta know who's using what," he said."Should it do more?" he said of the order. "Yes, but the seriousness of seven pages of executive order with specifics is quite unusual."
Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canDespite atrocious wet weather, people turned out in force once again for the raising of the cross on Tunstall Hill.It was the 51st time that the event has been held after it was started in 1964.The gathering brings together worshippers from across Wearside to mark Good Friday and commemorate the crucifixion of Jesus.After the cross was nailed into place, a Passion Play was performed, while prayers were also said.Rev Chris Howson, who is based at Sunderland Minster and is also chaplain at Sunderland University, led the service.He said: “Despite the terrible weather we’ve still got a huge turnout.“It’s extraordinary and shows how much people in Sunderland want to mark Good Friday.“Loads of people and their families have made the effort and it’s brilliant.”
AN IMPRESSIVE new bridge has arrived and been lifted into place on the B3212 – linking back up Dousland and Princetown.And local retired policeman, Roger Mechan, says it has "changed the view for the rest of my lifetime, and everyone else's".Roger, an amateur photographer, captured some images and a film of the Vierendeel truss bridge being installed over the Yelverton to Princetown Road.The old bridge was demolished when the line was closed on March 3, 1956. It now completes the walking/cycling like from Coypool to Princetown.The 67-year-old, who has lived in Plymouth his whole life, explained: "Before the railway there was a tramway drawn by horses taking granite from the moor."This extended all the way through Sutton Harbour up to Coypool and through a tunnel to Princetown, all the way to the quarries."Roger, who is about to self-publish a book on 'industrial Dartmoor', thinks the new bridge is "well-designed" and allows people to still enjoy the views.Yesterday (02/04) saw the arrival of Peekhill Bridge, meaning a diversion route was put in place during the manoeuvre. It took most of the day to move into place.

Police are trying to trace a man who abused and spat at railway station staff in Newport.Officers were called following a report of a person being aggressive and verbally abusive towards staff and members of the public on Saturday, March 7.PC Debi Rouse, who is investigating the incident, said: “At around 3pm, a passenger was stopped at the ticket barriers after his ticket alerted station staff. He immediately became agitated and started shouting at, and verbally abusing, the staff members.This is the man police want to speak to about the incident“They tried calming him down but he continued in the same manner, so was asked to leave the station.“In doing so, he tried getting a refund on his ticket but became increasingly aggressive and started spitting at the booking office window.“At this point, a member of the public intervened and the man turned his aggression towards him. Quite understandably, ticket office staff refused to deal with him due to his aggressive nature and pulled down the blind. He then left the station.”Officers have released a CCTV image of a man they would like to speak to in connection with the incident.He is described as Asian, around 5ft 7in tall, of slim build with black spiky hair, and was wearing a brown puffa jacket, jeans and trainers.Anyone with information about this incident should contact British Transport Police on Freefone 0800 40 50 40 or text 61016 quoting reference WSUB/B6 of 01/04/2015.
A TALENTED Dalgety Bay student is planning another successful chapter after impressing one of the world’s leading crime writers – for the second time.James Cowan (19), who is studying journalism at Fife College, was awarded the Ian Rankin Scholarship in 2014 and repeated the feat last week.And the author, famous for a series of bestsellers featuring fictional detective Rebus, took time out from writing his new book to attend the awards celebration in Kirkcaldy.James said, “I am very pleased and proud to have won this award for a second year and it was great to meet Ian again.“I’m hoping to go to university to study journalism and so this award will come in extremely handy.”The teenager was one of three students to be awarded the scholarship, they each received £600 and a signed copy of Ian’s latest book, ‘The Beat Goes On’, a compilation of short stories which was published last year.It was open to media students and, to take part, they had to submit a piece of creative writing which was read and judged by Ian himself.He said, “The scholarship programme is a great initiative and provides many students with an extra bit of help and recognition while they study.“It was great to meet the students and I really enjoyed reading their work. They had all written excellent short stories which I have promised I won’t steal!”Prior to the presentation, the students joined Ian for afternoon tea where they chatted about their course work and he gave them an insight into his writing process and where he gets the ideas for his next bestseller.The crime writer then took part in a Q&A – filmed by journalism students – to find out what inspires him.Debbie Miller, vice principal for commercial development, said, “We were delighted to welcome Ian Rankin to present this very prestigious scholarship award.“Not only has Ian supported the award for the past 11 years, he also takes a great interest in the students’ work and gives up his time to review and judge their creative writing which is a very valuable experience for the students.“Each year Ian spends his afternoon at College chatting to the students, answering their many questions and sharing his own experiences, which makes for a very memorable and inspirational day.”She added, “Receiving a scholarship from such a well-known author as Ian Rankin means a great deal to the students and is a fantastic achievement which will help them secure future study, employment opportunities and provide some extra financial support which is always very welcome.
Iran’s foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, has returned to Tehran to a hero’s welcome as thousands of people desperate for an end to international sanctions greeted him at the airport after Thursday’s historic breakthrough in the Lausanne nuclear talks.A crowd gathered at Tehran’s Mehrabad airport on Friday morning as Zarif, the country’s chief nuclear negotiator, and his team arrived from Switzerland, where they agreed a framework deal that provides the basis for a more comprehensive nuclear agreement. Iranians hope the deal will end years of international isolation and economic hardship – and avert the threat of war.Under the tentative agreement, restrictions will be placed on Iran’s enrichment of uranium so that it is unable to use the material in nuclear weapons. In return, the US and EU will terminate all nuclear-related economic sanctions on Iran once the UN nuclear agency confirms that Iran has complied.“Zarif, thank you,” people chanted while waving the Islamic republic’s green, white and red flag. Others took out their mobile phones to take pictures of a man who will become a national hero if a final agreement, due in June, is reached.On Thursday night, jubilant Iranians took to the streets within hours of the news breaking in Lausanne. Drivers in Tehran honked their car horns even after the midnight as men and women waved flags and showed victory signs from open windows. In an unprecedented move, Iran’s national TV also broadcast Obama’s Thursday speech on the agreement live.“Everyone is happy,” an Iranian journalist based in Tehran told the Guardian. “You can see it in people’s faces. This agreement is lifting up their heart.” The deal was announced as Iranians were celebrating the last day of the the Nowruz new year holiday. But on Saturday, as the exchange market opens, many experts predict that the country’s currency, the rial, will benefit from the breakthrough almost immediately.Iran’s president, Hassan Rouhani, who has much to gain from a comprehensive agreement, is due to address the nation on Friday. His chief of staff, Mohammad Nahavandian, has already declared the result as a victory for Iran.The Friday prayers leader, Ayatollah Imami Kashani, who often reflects the political mood among the conservative faction of the Islamic republic, said: “The Lausanne declaration was a success, we should congratulate Zarif. The world finally accepted that Iran should have a nuclear programme for peaceful and technological purposes.”Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is yet to announce his views of the breakthrough, has strongly supported Rouhani’s nuclear diplomacy in the past. As a result of Khamenei’s backing, hardlinersrestrained from attacking Zarif during the talks.Despite this, Hossein Shariatmadari, the hardline editor of the Kayhan state newspaper, was quick to denounce the framework agreement. “We gave them a saddled horse and they gave back some broken reins,” he was quoted as saying by local media.A small group of Iranian MPs echoed Shariatmadari and threatened that any agreement should be endorsed by the country’s parliament, the Majlis. Seyed Hossein Naghavi, spokesman for the parliamentary’s committee on the national security and foreign policy, said: “We will not recognise an agreement that would not lead to a complete lifting of all sanctions.” Ismail Kowsari, another MP from the committee, complained that Iran has not achieved its goal for all sanctions to be lifted.However, the framework agreement has garnered a great deal of support within Iran. “I feel very proud as an Iranian,” Kazem Sadjadpour, a university professor, said on Iran’s state TV on Thursday night. “This is a turning point in Iran’s history of diplomacy. This is a night of mourning for [Israel’s prime minister Binyamin] Netanyahu and his warmongering allies in the US congress.”Netanyahu condemned the agreement in a statement releasedon Friday morning: “A deal that is based on this framework will threaten Israel’s existence … The alternative is to stand firmly and increase pressure on Iran until a better deal is reached.“This deal would legitimise Iran’s nuclear programme, bolster Iran’s economy and increase Iran’s aggression and terror throughout the Middle East and beyond. It would increase the risks of nuclear proliferation in the region and the risks of a horrific war.”On Thursday, a defiant Barack Obama described the deal as “the best option so far” to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon. “This has been a long time coming,” Obama said. “It is a good deal, a deal that meets our core objectives … If this framework leads to a final, comprehensive deal, it will make our country, our allies and our world safer.”There was a clear sign of the battle to come in Washington over the agreement, which Republicans have vowed to overturn. Senator Mark Kirk, who is promoting fresh sanctions against Iran, declared that former British prime minister Neville Chamberlain had “got a better deal from Adolf Hitler” at Munich.Elsewhere there was support for the deal. Carl Bildt, the former foreign minister of Sweden, tweeted: “Doors should now be open to a deeper diplomatic dialogue with Iran also on other contentious issues. The region needs more open dialogue.” Mark Fitzpatrick, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “I am surprised – very pleasantly so – that the #IranTalks reached an extensive framework for an agreement. A win-win outcome for the world.”Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, who is organising an event in Geneva in September to bring Iranian and foreign investors together to study business opportunities in post-sanctions Iran, also welcomed the news.“Rouhani’s political legitimacy and the legitimacy of the deal will depend on a promise of economic growth and relief for the average Iranian,” he told the Guardian. “Oil prices will remain low, so growth will require increased foreign direct investment that can help create jobs and boost consumer spending.”Batmanghelidj said the nuclear deal would allow a new phase of business development work to begin in earnest. “The most important thing for Iranian businesses is new and more transparent corporate communications that can support relationship building with multinational firms in a way that builds public trust,” he said.

The Resident Electoral Commissioner in Kano State, Mr Mikhail Abdullah, has died in a fire outbreak at his house in Kano State North West Nigeria.Mr Adbullah’s wife and two of their children were also killed in the fire incident.According to the police, the inferno occurred around 4:00am on Friday.The Kano State spokesman, Mr Magaji Majiya, who confirmed the incident, said that the commissioner of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and his family died as they tried to escape through the window of their apartment.Mr Majiya said that the fire later spread to other parts of the house. He said that their attempt to escape through the window of one of the toilets in the building were hindered blocked by a burglary barrier.The Late Minkaila and his family were rushed to the Murtala Mohammed Specialist Hospital, Kano, where they died later.He explained that the fire was suspected to have been caused by a spark in the family’s generator at about 4:00am local time.The police said more information about the incident would be released after an autopsy on the remains of Mr Abdullahi and his family.The bodies of the victims have been conveyed to his native town, Dutse, the Jigawa State capital, for burial, in line with Islamic tradition.Mr Abdullahi made history on March 28, when he stood firm to ensure a successful conduct of Presidential and National Assembly elections in Kano.
The Kenya National Union of Teachers (KNUT) are recommending the immediate closure of  Garissa University College and advice the State to turn the institution into a security installation and maybe hand it over to the police for purposes of their own training.“All surviving students should be transferred to other universities in safer parts of our country to pursue their future,” KNUT Secretary General, Wilson Sossion said.Sossion also claims to have information that the students at the Garissa Teachers Training College may have survived the attack because they closed a day earlier.KNUT also advices that students from this college be transferred to other safer institutions before the beginning of the new term in May.“We have forwarded this matter to the Education International (EI) for deliberations because it is clear that the Northern part of Kenya has been conquered by terrorists in the same manner as the Boko Haram has taken over the Northern Nigeria,” said Sossion.KNUT Secretary General has also advised teachers in Northern Kenya to leave if they feel unsafe.In conclusion, KNUT through their secretary general, are urging President Uhuru Kenyatta to “consider removing the Minister for Education Prof Jacob Kaimenyi from the education docket because his continued stay will demolish the entire sector since he doesn’t listen to the multi-sectoral voices in his ministry.”
Sheffield City Trust’s Exercise Referral Scheme has been included in a recent Public Health England report.Out of almost 1,000 health projects across the country, Sheffield City Trust’s scheme, which is celebrating its 10th birthday this year, was one of just six to be selected for the Exercise Referral section as an example of best pratice.It uses physical activity to help people manage conditions including coronary heart disease, muscular skeletal diseases, respiratory illnesses, diabetes and weight problems.Patients are referred by their GP for 12 weeks of tailored physical activity with Exercise Referral and Cardiac Rehabilitation specialists. They take part in low impact exercise such as circuits and chairobics. Around 60 per cent of patients continue with exercise at the end of the 12 weeks.More than 15,000 patients referred from 107 surgeries have transformed their lives through the scheme, which launched at Concord Sports Centre in 2005 and now operates across five leisure venues in Sheffield.Craig Potts, from Shirecliffe, lost 16 stones by taking part in the scheme.He said: “At 30 stones, simple tasks like tying my shoes were a struggle. My body was a ticking time bomb. With physical activity I lost more than half my body weight and it’s saved my life.”Dave Birds, the trust’s Group Exercise Referral Manager, said: “We’re extremely proud to have been included in this national report highlighting best practice across the country. The Exercise Referral Scheme is a real success story.”
The US Consul General in Lagos, Mr Jeffrey Hawkins, has urged politicians in Rivers to emulate the spirit of sportsmanship shown by President Goodluck Jonathan and president-elect, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari.Hawkins told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Port Harcourt on Thursday that the people should participate actively in the April 11 governorship election.“Looking forward, we have another election that will take place on April 11 in Rivers and across the country.“We really want to urge non-violence on the part of the political actors or the people.“We want the people of Rivers to follow the examples of the president-elect, Buhari, and President Jonathan in the Abuja peace accord, leading to peace,’’ he said.Hawkins said the US ambassador to Nigeria had signed a peace pledge with three governorship candidates in the state.“We want to ensure that the security forces continue to protect the people. We want to ensure that the parties act responsibly; we want to commend the use of technology to increase the credibility of the electoral process, and that includes the card readers,’’ he said.The consul general said the US embassy was hopeful that the card readers would be used for the governorship election.He urged the people to seek redress in the court where there were cases of injustice and problems, instead of resorting to violence.He said there was a need for the political actors to refrain from violent behaviours and not to encourage their supporters to intimidate the voters.

The Rebels have secured their first home win of the Super Rugby season, beating the struggling Queensland Reds 23-15 in Melbourne.The Reds' James Horwill scored the opening try inside five minutes before Jake Schatz doubled Queensland's try count seven minutes later, but the visitors' night was set to get a lot worse.Horwill was shown a red card for a high shot on 20 minutes, allowing the Rebels to regain the ascendancy.Lopeti Timani and Tom English scored first-half tries as the teams went in level at 15-15 at the break.Scrum half Nic Stirzaker then scored what proved to be the winning try 15 minutes from full-time, before full-back Mike Harris slotted a penalty to secure an eight-point win.More to come.

I am not vain, rich or brave enough to face plastic surgery, when my mother rang for her weekly chat and I was feeling ancient after spotting a new wrinkle, I probed her for beauty advice.If I was feeling old, she, with a nearly 40-year-old daughter, must be feeling ancient - yet she looked great.At 65, she could easily pass for ten years younger.'I thank my genes, the fact I've never tried a cigarette and the facial stretches I've been doing for 30 years,' she said.Ah, those. I remember my mum slathered in Vaseline, gurning in a Club Sport tracksuit while I ate my Coco Pops, invariably wearing the Deely Bobbers I insisted on sleeping in between 1983 and 85. So they worked?My mother swore they did.Facial exercises have been around as long as youth has been considered the hallmark of beauty, with some claiming Cleopatra was the first celebrity fan.The first official guide, however, was published in Paris in 1710, outlining the beauty routine of Ninon de L'Enclose, a courtesan famed for her lasting beauty.Nearly two centuries later, Sanford Bennett - a notoriously wrinkle-free San Franciscan 70-year-old - released his book, Exercising In Bed, which gave away his facial secrets.From then on, facial exercisers came thick and fast.Jack LaLanne, the funny Hollywood guy permanently in tight Lycra was the visage visionary of the Fifties, right up to the Eighties.Today, however, the go-to expert is Carole Maggio, the LA-based creator of Facercise, with a celebrity and royalty-packed client list.WHICH FACIAL EXERCISES WORKED BEST FOR ME? This involves spreading my fingers across the centre of my forehead, then pulling my fingertips down while pushing my brows up so I look very confused.  I had to hold this tension for 30 seconds while staring at the ceiling. The Furrow Smoother involves spreading the fingers across the centre of the forehead for 30 seconds Sarah pulls her fingertips down while pushing her brows up to work her forehead muscles This is an exercise which requires a Joker smile that moves up and down an inch using visualisation.  'Now move your mouth to express that - ew - and hold it.' Maggio encourages exercises to form an 'ew' expression of disgust and hold it to lift the lips  This isn't pretty either. It requires me to push up the tip of my nose with my index finger while pulling my upper lip down for a count of 40.  All of these exercises are performed while looking at myself so I can see that I resemble a tired-looking Miss Piggy with a hangover. But I feel the burn.  The burn! The burn that means it's working! The next day, after my first facial workout, I wake up to a face as sore as my glutes were after I took my first spin class in 2004, but I push on with my exercises.  The Nose Transformer was so tough that Sarah's face muscles were still and sore the next day'After six days of doing her exercises twice a day, I could see significant improvement,' a gorgeous gal pal, also in her 50s, told me.Her nickname is Maggio the Magician and I needed her to work her magic on my ageing face. Luckily, her books and DVDs are available on Amazon and ship within days.Carole's first foolproof tips seem easy enough to do: sleep on your back without any pillows under your neck and try to avoid carbs after 5pm.She also advises drinking more water and eating more protein.These things instantly help everyone's appearance as they get older, apparently.The DVD and guidebook then go through a series of exercises that Carole promises will take the years off and plump up my ageing skin. So.Now my new gym routine is less about getting sweaty in Lycra and more about sitting in front of a mirror pulling a series of scary, exaggerated expressions, working my 57 facial muscles while sitting with my butt clenched and back straight.I work my way through the exercises without any problems - although it hurts more than I thought it would.I am a sit-down-with-a-cheese-sandwich-and-a-Jane-Austen-novel kind of girl rather than a natural gym bunny, but even I'm shocked my face aches this much. I am feeling the desired burn in places I never knew I had.Facial exercising is not for the lazy - it takes about 20 minutes a day and it really does hurt in places - but after two weeks my husband is convinced he can see a difference, and I feel a bit more plumped up; more ruddy farmer's wife than aging, old crone.My upper lip is definitely fuller and for the first time in my life I feel bee-stung enough to try red lipstick.Do I look younger? I'd say so. Fresher? Indeed. Perhaps face exercise really are the key to facing forward?
HULL KR coach Chris Chester was delighted to have claimed the first derby win of the season with a 20-6 victory over Hull FC at the KC Stadium.Rovers didn't have to work too hard for the win as they climbed to fourth in Super League.Terry Campese, Kieran Dixon and Shaun Lunt scored KR's three tries, with Josh Mantellato kicking all four of his attempts at goal.Chester was pleased with the execution of the game plan he had worked on all week and it paid dividends when it mattered most."The effort to get into a commanding lead and be in control of the game for the full 80 minutes was very pleasing," Chester said."Defensively we were very strong, especially in the second half when our effort was great."We were not as fluent as we would have liked, but we created enough opportunities to win two or three games."These bunch of players keep turning up for each other. We were by far the better team and we deserved to win."Having announced the extension of Campese's contract earlier in the week, Chester said he was delighted with his skipper's contribution.Chester is looking forward to working with him for the next three years, especially when he creates space for the likes of full-back Dixon to run in to."Terry and Albert Kelly created a lot of space," he said."Terry brings this team together. He was very good again."They threw plenty at us, but we found a way to combat it."FC threw it around, especially in the first half, but we made some good defensive decisions."Chester praised full-back Dixon for a solid game that included the second try, and refused to blame him for the only try Hull managed."Kieran was strong carrying the ball," Chester said."He is a threat every time gets the ball. They broke our line a few times and for their try Kieran tried to get out of his own line."We invited them back into the game with silly errors."But we spoke before the game about winning the energy battle."We did that and got some good momentum."Tyrone McCarthy is an early doubt for Monday's clash with Huddersfield with a shoulder injury, while Kris Welham injured his thumb.Aaron Ollett and Liam Salter could return on Monday.
Brownie leader Jane Shuffley has spoken out against the Guides’ new promise omitting GodA Brownie leader, parents and a parish priest from Cardiff have spoken out against the Guides’ new promise omitting God, saying Christianity is under attack in an increasingly secular society.Jane Shuffley, the leader of St Peter’s Brownies in Cardiff, still allows her pack to say the old Brownie promise in defiance of the change which was made in 2013 after a consultation involving 44,000 people.The pack, which runs from St Peter’s Catholic Church in Roath with 22 Brownies aged seven to 11 and 10 Rainbows aged five to seven, is one of the oldest in Cardiff.Although most members are Catholic some are from other religions, or none, so Jane gives them the choice of using the old or new promise.But she is angry that Girlguiding, the organisation running Brownies and Guides, won’t officially allow that choice.“I have spoken to parents and they want to keep the old promise and one said they didn’t mind either way,” she said.“They say groups should have their own opinions but are telling us we can’t say we believe in God.“The Guides are now saying it was never anything to do with religion but the original promise, when [Scout founder Robert] Baden-Powell started, had God in it and he was a Christian.”Brownies serve up tea back in the 1980sJane, who has been involved with the pack for 38 years since joining aged 17, pointed out that many Rainbow, Brownie and Guide groups are run from churches, although they take girls not in the church.“They said having God in the promise was not fair on atheists and agnostics but this is not fair on believers.”Jane, membership secretary of Faith Guiding, a national campaign set up by Brownie and Guide groups opposing the change, said legal advice was being sought to see if lack of choice in using the word ‘God’ breaches human rights.RELATED: Three decades not out: Meet the Guide leader so dedicated she even went into labour on an event nightDamien Murphy, father of one of St Peter’s Brownies, believes the change is one more attack against religion in an ever-more secular society.“It’s offensive to remove God from the promise for those that want it,” he said“What is the new promise trying to say? It’s like saying God is no longer important in our lives.”Girl Guides line up in 1959 at the Royal Welsh ShowLucia Carpanini-West, whose six-year-old daughter is a member of the pack, agreed.“We are still, as far as I’m aware, a Christian country and there should be a choice. God was always in there, it was part of Guiding.“We are not forcing anyone to say anything they don’t want – just saying they should have the choice to have God in the promise.“Some Christians are embarrassed to stand out because society has changed so much now.”Don't know what the Guide promise sounds like? Watch this and find out:Father Michael McCarthy, priest at St Peter’s, said removing God from the promise was “rather unfair”.“This new format is trying to be fair to those that don’t believe in God but is keeping out those that do believe,” he said.“I would like people to have been given the choice.”Girlguiding said the change followed consultation involving nearly 44,000 people of all ages from inside and outside Guiding as a way to “welcome even more girls and adults”.“Our members made it very clear during the consultation that they wanted to retain just one promise,” said Chief Guide Gill Slocombe.“It is what unifies all members of all backgrounds or circumstances – it is our common standard.“After further conversations with our members we have also offered the option for people to say a preface before the promise to put it in the context of their own specific beliefs.“Thousands of girls and volunteers have made our promise since it changed and Girlguiding has continued to grow strongly – we have 80,000 girls and young women on our waiting list which is our highest ever figure.”
The Borno Elders Forum on Thursday advised President-elect, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, to strive towards eradicating all sources of insurgency and insecurity in the country immediately after assuming office.Alhaji Gaji Galtumari, the Chairman of the forum, gave the advice in a statement in Maiduguri.“The Borno Elders Forum‎ wishes to sincerely extend hearty congratulations to our President-elect and Vice-President elecover their cherished and well deserved victory in the just concluded presidential poll.“We see this as a victory for democracy, peace and harmony throughout the country and beyond. It is a victory for the black race and the masses in general.’’The statement said the congratulatory message needed to be accompanied by a few words of advice to the in-coming President.“Over the past few years, Nigerians have been terribly afflicted by insurgency and high level terrorism.“For us in Borno and indeed the North East, it is not an exaggeration to say that we have been taken back several years in terms of all indices of human development. Although, we believe it was our destiny.“We therefore urge Mr President to promptly eradicate all forms of insurgency and violence across the country.“This should be the starting point. Nothing works without peace. We recently had cause to plead with the nation to come up with a Marshall Plan for the North East, starting first by setting up a high level Presidential Assessment Committee to take stock of the level of devastation.We need to be quickly rescued, rehabilitated, reconstructed, resettled and re-established,’’“Over the few years under reference, Nigeria has been terribly polarised on sectional, religious and tribal lines.“We thank the Al-Mighty Allah that Nigerians remained resolute in their desire for one indivisible, indissoluble and indestructible nation.Indeed, the spirit of Nigeria as brothers’ keepers persisted at the level of the masses of our people.“Now, Mr President-elect needs to cash in on this spirit of Nigerianness demonstrated by the masses throughout the nation.It had come to Nigerians constantly relocating to their states of origins each time there are issues like elections, census, and so on.“Nigerians lived in the fear of the unknown even when they desired to live together in peace and harmony.’’The statement called on Buhari to quickly address the diversification of sources of revenue generation in the country.It added that the country needed to pay attention to agriculture and solid minerals development.“We equally need to accelerate the exploration and exploitation of petroleum deposits, particularly in the Chad Basin and the Benue Trough and other places.’’It also called for taking away from the streets the millions of unemployed youths.“Jobs need to be created on daily basis and young people should be encouraged to take them up.“All school age children must be compelled to go to school. Massive investment in education and vocational training is a priority.’’It added that Buhari needs a `great’ cabinet to achieve most of the promises made to Nigerians.“We know Buhari to be a straight-forward, simple, honest, incorruptible and just leader.“He has been our Governor in the then North East and also been a Head of State.“From his antecedents, we have no doubt about his ability and resolve to deliver effectively.“Yet, he needs a cabinet of like minds, men and women who would think, dream, work and display transparency like Buhari.’’ (NAN)
Jayasuriya, 45, has been accused of politicising the game after he became a member of parliament from president Mahinda Rajapakse's party following his retirement from the game in 2009.The former batsman also copped criticism for making four changes to the team at last month's World Cup quarter-finals that Sri Lanka lost to South Africa by nine wickets.Critics took issue with the inclusion of new opening batsman Kusal Perera and paceman Dushmantha Chameera for Sri Lanka's defeat in the lopsided match.Jayasuriya - a member of Sri Lanka's 1996 World Cup-winning team -- said he was bowing out to give the new management an opportunity to appoint a new selection panel but did not rule out a comeback."I am always available if Sri Lanka Cricket needs me to serve the country in the future," he said in his letter of resignation, a copy of which was seen by AFP.He said the other four members of the selection panel had also stepped down, though their contracts run until the end of the month."We gave separate letters of resignations and have quit," Jayasuriya told AFP.The mass resignation comes just days after Sports Minister Navin Dissanayake appointed an interim committee headed by former Test player Sidath Wettimuny to manage Sri Lanka Cricket, asking him to "clean up" the administration of the sport.
Fire has gutted a store in Omu-Aran, Irepodun local government area of Kwara, destroying property estimated at N1 million on Thursday.The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the property destroyed in the store located on Aperan Way, included foams, asbestos and other building materials.The fire was said to had broken out at about 4 p.m. and some sympathisers rushed to the scene to put out the inferno that raged for more than three hours.The fire also destroyed a vehicle with Reg. No: AA 512 NBS, belonging to one Chief Popoola Rufus parked within the premises of the store.An eye witness, Mrs Aishat Adeniyi, told NAN that she raised alarm when the fire broke out as she was inside the store.“The fire actually started from the goods packed inside the makeshift store in front of the warehouse before it spread.“There was no sign of smoke, the only thing I saw was fire raging from the planks, packed inside the makeshift store outside the warehouse where I was sitting and I quickly raised the alarm,” Adeniyi said.NAN reports that no life was lost during the incident.The owner of the store, Alhaji Razak Olorunkemi, told NAN he did not have any insurance cover for the goods, saying that he had placed everything in the hands of God.“What else do you want me to say in this circumstance, God almighty is all knowing,” said Olorunkemi.It would be recalled that the owner had suffered a similar fire outbreak in 2014 where property estimated at more than N50 million perished.Meanwhile, a community leader, Alhaji Atolagbe Suleiman, has renewed call for location of a fire service station in the community.Suleiman, who hold the traditional title of Oloo of Omu-Aran, said the two fire service stations in Ilorin and Offa were far off to rescue people’s property in the event of fire disasters.

KUALA LUMPUR — The value of Malaysia's exports dropped by 9.7% year-on-year in February, dragged down by lower commodity prices and weak global demand, the government said Friday.The total value of exports in February declined by 5.7 billion ringgit (US$1.55 billion) to 53.2 billion ringgit from 58.9 billion ringgit for the same period last year, the Department of Statistics said.The agency noted that while the volume of refined petroleum products exported rose by 0.5% in February, the actual receipts declined by 32.5% due to weak global oil prices. Exports to China, the country's biggest market, declined by 21.3%.The drop in exports came after a year-on-year fall of 0.6% in January.Bank Negara Malaysia, the country's central bank, was expecting the country's economy to grow at a slower pace of between 4.5% and 5.5% in 2015. Malaysia's economy grew 6% in 2014.

They have been issued with letters stating that unless they vacate their homes within a month of the date of issue, market-related rentals, to be determined by the Department of Public Works, will kick in for three months.Failure to comply by then will result in disciplinary and/or legal action."Please note that being allocated official housing, which is limited, is on a temporary basis and you, the employee, have the ultimate responsibility to provide housing for yourself and your dependants," a copy of the letter issued by police last month reads.This move is seen as a bid by the police to tackle the crisis around its official housing system, which has been in the spotlight for several years.It is unclear if the eviction plan affects police in other provinces.However, some barracks in other cities have been found to be in a shocking state.Mpho Kwinika, president of the South African Police Union, said the union feared that most of its members affected by the eviction threat would not be able to afford alternative housing after so many years."This is a serious crisis," Kwinika said.Many of the barracks are in a shocking condition and have been poorly maintained over the years.Police management has battled to ensure that officers who have been assigned a temporary home move after a certain period. In some cases, it has been hard to keep out illegal occupants.On Wednesday, rats were seen running around at the Alexandra police barracks in Johannesburg.Communal toilets were broken and light fittings in the foyer dangled dangerously from the ceiling.Water supply, the residents said, was intermittent - and most of the one-room units were powered by extension cords running from outside because there were not enough working plugs inside the four-storey building.In 2012, the Sunday Times exposed the horrendous living conditions at the police barracks where our men and women in blue were housed.At the time, and only days after General Riah Phiyega was appointed national police commissioner, she pledged to add the shocking conditions of the barracks to her list of priorities.Now, nearly three years later, nothing appears to have changed for the cops who live there.Barracks housing in Alexandra was meant to accommodate only single officers, but some policemen live there with their entire families.The wife of a lieutenant, who has more than 30 years of experience in the police, said: "It is not nice staying here."It is dirty. There are rats all over and the toilets are not flushing. My kids play in these dirty passages."She said there were only intermittent spells of running water. "We have to go outside and fetch water with a bucket to wash."The wife of another policeman said her children had to move to their grandmother because it was too dirty at the Alexandra barracks."Obviously it affects their health. There are no showers, no baths; we have to fill a bucket to bathe. I do not have anywhere else to go. Where should we stay?"She said her husband, a constable in the SAPS who earns just under R110000 a year, will not be able to afford alternative housing and to provide for their four children.George Goch police barracks just off the M2 going from Johannesburg to Germiston was also intended to house single officers, but now serves as accommodation for policemen, women and their families.There were also several illegal occupants not associated with the police.As was the case at the Alexandra barracks, access control at George Goch was nonexistent."This place is a health hazard. I cannot take our children to the toilet. They have to sit on a bucket because the toilets are too bad. Your children get sick all the time," said the niece of a sergeant who has been staying at the barracks for the past eight years.One police sergeant who asked not to be identified said he had no choice but to believe that the government did not care about policemen and women."They expect you to perform and come to work proud of your uniform, but we have to stay in these conditions."They expect you to have shiny boots at work, but you stay in a dirty place," he said.The barracks at Norwood and Sophiatown were in no better shape.On Wednesday, three young men were seen carrying a fridge up 13 flights of stairs because the lift at the Herdeshof building in Sophiatown has not been working since 2005.There was a stench coming from the building as each floor was littered with rubbish.A policeman who has stayed in this building for more than a decade said the foul smell and the rubbish were not his only problems."We have no security here, so people come and break into our cars even if they are parked in the garages."They have broken into the homes of some of the members and stolen their firearms when they were away."Former acting national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi has been appointed head of facility management to "crack the whip" in resolving problems with the barracks.A spokesman for Phiyega, Lieutenant-General Solomon Makgale, said responsibility of the barracks rested with the SAPS and the Department of Public Works.He said policemen in the single quarters did not receive the R900 monthly housing allowance, and thus paid 1% of their salaries as rent, which was capped at R200 a month. These members often did not pay for water and electricity, which led to the services being cut, he said.Some also moved their spouses and children into single-person units, leading to "faster deterioration" of the facilities, thus requiring additional maintenance.But he said some policemen in the barracks also failed to take it upon themselves to adhere to normal cleanliness standards. Others sublet their allocated units for financial gain.Makgale conceded: "No regular inspections are done and members are left to do as they please."He said public works had massive maintenance backlogs and it was not always possible to provide alternative housing as state-owned accommodation was not readily available. There was no leasing budget .He said the letters issued were given specifically to members who lived in buildings in urgent need of repair. It was hoped the three-month notice period would be long enough to enable them to seek alternative accommodation.

Pictured l to r are; Alan Horohoe, Joe Cribbin, Philip Gordon, Brian Byrne, Eamonn Gleeson, Alan Farrell, John Devaney, Daniel Murphy and Hugh Keane. Photo: Declan GilmoreLough Ree Angling Hub was launched last week and the organisation aims to bring fishing back to Lanesboro and Ballyleague.The hub also hopes to foster a love of fishing in young people and just last week children from St Christopher’s Services received coaching from a number of experienced locals.Throughout the bank holiday weekend in June, an angling competition with €3,000 worth of prizes up for grabs will take place in Shannonside towns.Organisers say the area is highly regarded by anglers both domestically and from overseas because of the hot water stretch in the Shannon.Now, it has emerged just this week that the ESB plans to turn off the power at the plant in Lanesboro on the Friday of the weekend.Organisers believe that when the ESB cuts the power, certain fish will leave as the water begins to cool and this will interfere with the quality of the fish that is on offer for anglers that weekend.“The ESB says it is cutting the power on May 28 and if it does it will leave certain problems for us,” explained Philip Gordon who is a well known angler in Lanesboro.Mr Gordon was also one of the four people who travelled to the UK last week to promote the local angling competition there.“It will take about 36 hours for the hot water to stop running through the system; it is that hot water that invites the fish in, so that means that by the Saturday afternoon the people fishing the stretch of hot water at that stage, would have a marginal advantage over people fishing in that same location the following day.“Once the water begins to cool down, the fish tend to move, so what we want is for the ESB to hold off cutting the hot water for a day or two so that we can keep everything equal over the couple of days of our competition.“We have international high class anglers coming here that weekend and they will argue they weren’t treated fairly, so if the ESB just held off until the 29th or even May 30, that would be so helpful to us.“We have had some communication with the ESB and our understanding is that the decision to turn off the hot water at this particular time was probably made 15 months ago,” said Mr Gordon, adding that the national grid would also be affected by the state body’s decision.“But that said, there was supposed to be further talks with the ESB to see if we could do anything but nothing has happened yet.”However ESB made itclear in a statement to the Longford Leader on Monday that its position would not change in light of the angling competition.“The Hub were informed during a recent meeting that ESB Lough Ree Power will coincidentally be on annual outage during the angling competition over the June bank holiday weekend,” it read.“ESB has also agreed to promoting the angling competition and is well aware of, and shares the concerns of local interest groups in relation to the infestation of Asian Clams in the hot water stretch in Lanesboro.“With this in mind, ESB continues to assist Inland Fisheries Ireland (IFI) as they plan a response to the infestation.”Meanwhile, John Devaney of Inland Fisheries said the organisation was delighted to see efforts being made to bring angling back to the shores of Lough Ree.He also pointed out that while there had been negative publicity as a result of the Asian Clam, the area was open for business and the focus now, was on the future.“The aim of the angling hub is to resurrect the fishing industry in this area and we have put in disinfectant stations along the river as was recommended,” continued Mr Devaney.“Angling had been a major part of life in Lanesboro since the water stretch was first created back in the late 1960s especially in relation to course and specimen fish. We are hoping this competition will re-ignite things here.”Mr Devaney went on to say that it was still unclear as to the severity of damage caused by the Asian Clam, but said that the situation was now very much back under control, thanks to the support of a number agencies who worked together.“Asian Clam has the potential to wipe out fish, and that did happen in an area in the south of Ireland,” he confirmed,“However, the River Shannon and Lough Ree are huge areas, so we don’t know the extent of the damage yet. We are actively trying to get it dredged at the moment.”
People travelling by rail over Easter should "think twice", Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin has said.He told the Evening Standard large-scale rail engineering work may make journeys more difficult.Several major rail routes are affected, particularly the London to Scotland West Coast main line, parts of Kent and lines running through Reading.The RAC said four million motorists were expected to travel on Good Friday and some 4.5 million on Easter Sunday.Arriva Trains said passengers in Wales travelling to London would face delays due to engineering works."There will be alternatives and we've lifted almost all motorway roadworks to help," Mr McLoughlin said.More than 550 miles of roadworks have been put on hold over the weekend by Highways England, formerly the Highways Agency.For safety reasons the speed restrictions will remain in place but the roadworks, on England's motorways and major A roads, will not resume until Tuesday.Mr McLoughlin said "an army of 14,000 workers" would be working around the clock over the Easter weekend to upgrade train lines."But if you are travelling between Friday and Monday night please check your journey first, it may be that you'll think twice about how you travel."I'm sorry if it is more difficult - but my promise is that the work is essential and when it's done the benefits will be worthwhile."One passenger travelling on the sleeper train from Inverness to London Euston told the BBC that the delays were worse than expected.She said that passengers had been expecting a 90-minute delay after receiving a warning email a few weeks ago. However, after being diverted down the East Coast line, passengers faced a "long wait at Wembley", she said, where engineering works were taking place.Network Rail has promised to try to prevent a repeat of the rail chaos which occurred at Christmas.An overrunning engineering project shut the line between Reading and London Paddington at the end of last year.Julian Burnell, from Network Rail, said work on the Reading station redevelopment, in its last major stage, was a "very big project, dealing with one of the biggest bottlenecks anywhere in the country".He added: "I can't say there's absolutely no danger [of an overrun at Easter], but we have done everything in our power to get it finished in good time. There are hundreds of buses waiting if that happens."Work on the railways this Easter includes:As a result of the work being undertaken, Virgin is "strongly recommending" that passengers do not travel between Good Friday and Easter Monday.Speaking of the work being carried out at Watford, Network Rail route managing director Martin Frobisher said: "There is never a good time to carry out this type of work but we have liaised closely with the train operators to plan for it to take place at a quieter time on the railway."According to traffic information company Trafficmaster, the top five busiest stretches of road over Easter are likely to be:Breakdown company Green Flag said 54,000 call-outs were expected over the weekend, with one puncture every minute. It said the M4 was likely to be one of the worst-congested roads.Some 16 million cars are expected to take to the roads over Easter.The coach company National Express said it planned to provide 33,000 extra seats to cope with the extra demand from passengers.According to the travel group Abta, 1.8 million Britons are heading abroad over the weekend, with Spain and Florida among the top destinations.Heathrow Airport said it was expecting a record-breaking Easter weekend with more than 800,000 passengers passing through.The airport, which expects a 40% rise in the number of families travelling with small children, has called in 150 extra staff members.Gatwick Airport will see some 480,000 passengers between Good Friday and Easter Monday - an increase of about 11% on Easter last year.Are you planning a trip over the weekend?

Amateur singers, musicians, dancers and wannabes have more opportunity than ever before to leave their mark on the National Folk Festival.This year, the National has added another blackboard stage to the festival village, allowing pretty much anyone to shine.The new venue, called The Pod, is hosted, facilitated and enthusiastically managed by well known local sound engineer Tim Keeble (who also takes to the stage himself singing beautiful ballads)."It's a nice size for an intimate performance," Keeble said."We've had a lot of people get up on stage and present some very good music."There will be chances for musicians to do that all throughout the festival."And it has a small dance floor too, so we welcome dancers."The Bohemia Bar remains the festival's main blackboard stage, where selection is by ballot. Already some excellent talent has been on display at the Bohemia, a standout being the Guitar Cases - one of Canberra's most hard working bands.The venue also hosts a So You Think You Can Sing challenge, where audience members get up in front of a full band to give a nominated song a blast with their vocal chords.The Stock Camp, the Tantric Turtle and the PsyBus Space are the other walkup venues running blackboard gigs throughout the whole festival.
There are seven hours left to tell the decade-long story of "Mad Men," whose final half-season — Season 7, Part the Second, subtitled "The End of an Era" — begins Sunday on AMC.It has been with us since the George W. Bush administration, and if you have been following along, it can seem very much like a life you have been living yourself. Looking back over the years and seasons, the old episodes, with their recurring cycles of chaos and order, crisis and escape, death and rebirth, can seem eerily familiar, not just a show you've watched but a life — lives you've not just watched but lived.Like life, it resists explanation even as it seems to demand the hunt for meaning. It is a big-canvas show that seems to have things to say about America, and how we were, and how we are, but it is also a story about individuals in individual relationships. And like life, it lingers in the mind as a collection of moments, in snatches of speech or silence, in a memory of light, a cloud of smoke, a glance, a kiss, a slap — its glory is less in its plot than in its particulars.So although it matters what happens to Don and Peggy and Roger and Joan — because this is a story, in the end, with an end — it also doesn't matter, because these characters have been happening all along. Whatever period, comma or semi-colon or space creator Matthew Weiner has placed at the end of his midcentury epic of domestic relations and professional intrigue, whatever meaning the end seems to assign to the beginning and everything in between, will be in this sense at least beside the point.Weiner, who runs this ship and charts its course, has his own ideas about the show, obviously, which can only have been evolving since he first trained a camera on the back of Don Draper's — that is, Jon Hamm's — well-razored neck. (It was 1960 for Don, 2007 for us.) Some have attempted to decode not just his text but also his props and soundtrack, looking for clues to Don's end — suicide is a persistent theory — as if it were a treasure hunt and as if his fate were not a thing that has been discussed and debated for years among its writers and the devils and angels in Weiner's own head.From shot to shot and scene to scene, "Mad Man" has been a tightly controlled, fine-tuned work — it's TV without a hair out of place, even when someone's hair is (perfectly) out of place. It seems to be naturalistic, because it is not full of pumped-up action or crime or magic; it's all about work and family and love and being shut out from those things. But it is highly stylized, a beautiful animated object that has launched not only a thousand think pieces but also a thousand pictorials to bloom, estimating conservatively; it has also brought down upon us a raft of modern period pieces — "Pan Am," "The Playboy Club," "The Americans."The plan from the beginning seemed to be to contrast the creamy surfaces of the American postwar consumerist miracle and the cracks just below the surface, the distance between the promise and the reality. This was not news to America in 1960, at least not to the readers of Mad Magazine, which lampooned the products and practices of Madison Avenue in most every issue. But the show has moved into deeper waters.They are lonely, all these people. "You're starving, and not just for dinner," Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) said in her pitch to Burger Chef, two years after the death of the Summer of Love. They are out of time: Their encounters with modernity, with the counterculture, tend to confirm their squareness. "I've tried new-fashioned," Peggy (again) will say in Sunday's premiere to someone who calls her "old-fashioned." They resist the Computer Age, of "media buys pinpointed with surgical accuracy," the future that is now.Weiner opens and closes the season's opening episode with "Is That All There Is?," a late career hit for Peggy Lee (written by Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller in a Brecht-Weill mood), playing on the soundtrack. It serves as a wry comment on the characters' dissatisfaction — almost all of them are very rich by now and no more settled for it — and also as an ironic fanfare to the last act.The company, newly reconfigured yet again, is open for business. There are new mustaches in town. There are new patterns in the clothes and wallpaper. Don subscribes to a message service. He speaks casually — indeed, for comic effect — of his formerly secret horrible childhood. Life is progressing, and yet it is cycling back to the beginning: An old friend appears to Don in a dream; a new character is someone he thinks he knows. She will be the key to something, or not, but the end is near either way.I have hope. "The best things in life are free," Robert Morse sang in his literal swan song as agency elder Bert Cooper to close the first half of the seventh season. (Was that a tear in Don Draper's eye?)

NORTON A's 13-year dominance of the Sentinel Cup has been ended – by Norton B.The outcome of a thrilling final at Community Drive was sealed when B captain Neil Hough beat Dave Savage for the first ever time to give his side an unassailable 5-3 lead.It was the first time the A side have lost in the competition since 2002, when Savage had been the star of a Norton B side which lifted the trophy.They were missing inspirational skipper Brian Johns, who boasts a 100 per cent winning average this season as the As have stormed to the Potteries league title.But it still took a Herculean from Hough and his teammates Steve Rogers and Chris Bailey to pull off a famous victory."I just had a feeling in my stomach that it was going to be our night," said man of the match Hough.The game swung back and forth, with Hough beating Mark Evans and Bailey beating Savage but then losing to Evans when he had a chance to seal victory.The Bs were 4-3 in front as Hough prepared to take on Savage – and the majority of a packed house were expecting it to go to a decider between Steve Rogers and Steve Foster.He took the first game 13-11 and the second 11-7 before Savage got into his stride and took the third 11-8.Hough summoned another gear and took the fourth set 11-6 to lead his team to victory, collecting the trophy from the Sentinel's deputy sports editor Chris Travers."I thought we were there when Chris beat Dave but then he lost to Mark to make it 4-3 which was a bit of a shock," said Hough."I knew we would win if I beat Dave and, even though I had never beaten him before, I was full of confidence. I knew I could do it."I play with two pimple sides on my bat and he didn't seem comfortable. I sensed I had a chance and it was just a fantastic feeling to make it count."Savage had given the A side a 1-0 lead when he came from behind to beat Rogers 3-1 but Bailey made it all square when he saw off Foster, the Norton C player who had been asked to fill Johns' big boots.Hough beat Evans 3-1 then Bailey beat Savage – claiming six points in a row from 10-6 down in the fourth set to take the win.Evans held his nerve in a yo-yo game against Rogers to win 3-2 before Hough beat Foster 3-0 and Bailey had the chance to seal the victory with a win over Evans.Evans, however, took control and pulled his side to within one point of the Bs, but Hough would have the final say."If anyone was going to break Norton A's dominance then we are delighted it's us and the trophy stays in the club," said Hough."They are all quality players and they will bounce back."We are fiercely competitive rivals but only in the sporting sense. We were both desperate to win but we could all shake hands and have a drink together afterwards."We couldn't have asked for a better night."
A BRAZEN career robber who has boasted on Facebook of working in "midnight removals" uploaded a picture of himself sitting in the dock in court.By law photography is not allowed in UK courts, but a picture was posted onto Jordan Sim-Mutch's social media page on Wednesday. The picture shows the gang member and his mates grinning at the camera secretly operated by a pal in the public gallery. Sim-Mutch was later jailed for nine and a half years for a string of convenience store robberies which a judge condemned him and his gang for targeting shops for "easy money". The 24-year-old had already posted pictures of himself larking about with beer and large wads of cash – and also bragged about "chilling on tag" after being arrHe has even got his own toddler son to flash money and imitate his gangland signs for the camera. The next day mates commented on the courtroom image saying: "Love you Jord" and "Lads on tour". Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester was told the gang-of-four carried out armed robberies to pay for cannabis. They would steal car keys from burgled houses and used the vehicles in their hold-ups.They would attack convenience shops, petrol stations and a pub using weapons including bricks, baseball bats, a meat cleaver, axes, and, on one occasion, a fake firearm. In total the gang carried out 29 robberies and burglaries across Stockport and the Greater Manchester area. They were caught in November 2013, but having been granted bail by the courts, they started up their robbery spree again just months later. The gang then had to ensure the raids took place in the day time between their hours of curfew which were subject to an electronic tag.Sim-Mutch pleaded guilty to conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to commit burglary, conspiracy to steal and conspiracy to possess an imitation firearm. His barrister Simon Morton, mitigating, said he was not a member who ordered victims to the floor because he suffers with a stammer. Explaining why got involved in the enterprise, Sim-Mutch told him: "Well I'm just a big daft lad, aren't I?" Mr Morton said: "He goes on to say there is no excuse for what he did. This is big mistake, a long time in jail for a poxy bit of money."

Manila - Devotees in the fervently Catholic Philippines marked Good Friday by being nailed to crosses and whipping their backs bloody, in extreme acts of devotion that attracted thousands of spectators.The annual ritual in scorching hot farmlands just outside of Manila is one of many colourful outpourings of faith in the Southeast Asian nation, where 80 percent of its 100 million people are Catholics.“I feel no pain because I know I am one with my God in suffering,” 30-year-old construction worker Arjay Rivera told AFP before he slit his back with broken bottles and razors, later whipping himself with bamboo flails to keep the wounds open.As the flagellants made an excruciatingly slow barefoot march to the hill in San Juan, a rural district of San Fernando north of Manila where the crucifixions were to take place, some of them stopped at times to lay face down on the hot pavement and let children flog them with twigs.Five men had nails hammered through their palms and feet while four others, some with fake beards drawn on their faces to resemble Christ, were tied to the crosses.They wailed in pain as attendants, costumed as Roman centurions, pounded the nails through their palms.“My faith got me through my illness. I will continue doing this for as long as I live,” one of the men, Wilfredo Salvador told AFP after he was taken down from a cross, his hands and feet wrapped in bandages.“It was painful up there, but I felt light. I can't explain it. I would say my faith is very strong,” added the 50-year-old, who said he had recovered from a nervous breakdown several years ago.Several of the men have undergone multiple crucifixions over the years.Seven-month pregnant Catherine Madoles wiped off blood that had splattered on her legs and half-exposed tummy.Her brother, Genesis Reyes, was one of those whipping his back, undergoing the ordeal for the first time on Friday so that she could have a safe delivery, she said.“I have a high-risk pregnancy because I'm diabetic. I hope this devotion will help me,” the 32-year-old housewife told AFP as she took refuge from the searing heat.San Fernando Archbishop Florentino Lavarias has discouraged the bloody practice, saying there are other ways to profess one's faith.“Our acts should be geared toward good works. Christian life is not something that is done overnight,” he counselled.San Fernando Mayor Edwin Santiago openly conceded that the religious ritual has vast economic benefits for the community.“We don't have the exact record of the money... but for sure the Good Friday activities help our locals in their businesses,” he said.This year's spectacle attracted a crowd of 60,000, roughly the same number last year, San Fernando Councillor Harvey Quiwa told AFP.While organisers tried to keep the event solemn, the general mood appeared more festive with dozens of hawker stalls selling food and souvenirs, giant streamers of mobile phone companies set up in various places and crowds taking photos with their smartphone and tablet cameras.Above the crucifixion hill, a huge brown kite in the shape of a cross flew overhead.Foreign tourists who flocked to the spectacle reacted with both shock and fascination even as blood from the flagellants splattered their clothing.“It's quite gross and bloody. I would never have a selfie taken here,” Jorene Chai, a 26-year-old tourist from Singapore, told AFP.She and three other friends made a side trip to the site from a food tour of Pampanga province.Waldemar Traczyk, 50, a history professor from Poland, said he saved up for seven years so he and his wife could fly to the Philippines to witness Friday's events.“This is too much blood... but it is interesting to know why a 17th century practice in Europe still persists in the Philippines,” he told AFP.The Philippines is known around the world for its fervent brand of Catholicism, which was introduced by Spanish colonisers in the 1500s.An annual procession of Christ's image in downtown Manila drew 5.5 million barefoot devotees last January, authorities said.A mass by Pope Francis in the capital's main outdoor park a week later drew a record crowd of six million people.
"There are swimmers and there are backstrokers," a grinning Lisa Forrest says while introducing Emily Seebohm to her audience at a swimwear product launch this week.Seebohm laughs upon hearing Forrest, who at the age of 16 was the Australian swimming team captain at the Moscow Olympic Games in 1980.Both are backstrokers in a sport in which most athletes spend hours upon hours chasing a black line."We are the only stroke that swims on our backs," Seebohm explains later when asked how she felt about Forrest's remark."For me, it is nice because it is something different and I get to look at the roof instead of the black line … sometimes I follow the camera."It's good for me because the camera is the pacer."Of course, Seebohm, 22, and a 2008 and 2012 Olympic gold medallist, does not spend all her swimming hours flat on her back.The Brisbane swimmer's heavy program at the Australian swimming championships at the Sydney Aquatic Centre at Homebush shows she is a class all-rounder.Her key events in the meeting are the 50m, 100m and 200m backstroke and 200m individual medley, in which she made the semi-final on Friday night by winning her heat that morning.Yet she is also entered for the 50m and 100m freestyle – she won the latter national title in 2010.But no doubt about it … the blood in Seebohm is that of backstroker; and if you doubt it check her national title record in backstroke that shows victories over the 100m distance in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2013, and 50m in 2010, 2012 and 2013.While Seebohm began competitive swimming at three years old, the turning point for her career-wise was the Australian trials in 2006, when she raced as a 14-year-old.After dead-heating with Taylia Zimmer in the 100m backstroke, Seebohm earned selection as the youngest member of the Australian team for the 2007 world championships in Melbourne, in which she also won gold in the 4 x 100m medley."I was 14 and I was extremely nervous and said to my coach before the race, 'Do you think I'll make the Australian team?' " Seebohm explains with a wry grin. "And he was like, 'Don't get ahead of yourself. Swim your own race and see how you go.'"I ended dead-heating for first … I was so ecstatic. I had never been so happy."And then people started coming up and asking me to sign their stuff."I didn't even know how to sign my name … I had never done it before."Seebohm admits that like her swimming, her signature did improve over the years."It did. It was really bad when I first started so if anyone has my first couple ... they are terrible and I don't even know what I wrote," she says."But now they are good."Of course, to be in a position where she continues to be sought for her signature, Seebohm knows she must produce the right performance at the nationals to make the Australian team again for the world championships at Kazan, Russia in August.But she has come to Sydney with the confidence and training times needed. "I have done some out of season times this year which have improved on last year," she said.It also helps, Seebohm says, knowing Australia swimming has rediscovered its way."We are starting to pick back up, which has been really good."It's also nice to see the changes in the team with a lot of young faces the last couple of years."The young ones keep us young and fresh and on our toes, which is good."

In our series of letters from African journalists, film-maker and columnist Farai Sevenzo reflects on the value of casting a vote in this year when there are so many elections in Africa.Nigeria has voted. All the world's pundits expected the same scratched record to play out to its predictable conclusion: Incumbent stays put.But President Goodluck Jonathan, defeated by Muhammadu Buhari, exhibited a rare grace by conceding and said he had kept his word about organising free and fair elections.It was a fine example to set in 2015, year which sees many African nations go to the polls.Zambia kicked off the year of the African votes in January, followed by Lesotho, where there was a snap election in February. This was after an attempted coup against Prime Minister Thomas Thabane which threatened to upset the peace of the mountain kingdom.In some cases election winners can be challenged and are seen as weak, and democracy has sometimes given way to chaosElsewhere, African voters will be wooed with T-shirts and bags of rice and promises of every grain and shade in Burkina Faso, Burundi, the Central African Republic, Chad, Ethiopia, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo during the course of 2015.Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir will be battling against the splintered opposition to maintain his grip on the presidency, now into its third decade.Meanwhile, Africa's youngest nation, South Sudan, has postponed its first election since independence, due this year, until 2017 because of continuing violence and the spectre of another protracted war.Over in the Central African Republic, 2014 was filled with bloody images as the country appeared to divide along religious lines.July's vote should be where people declare allegiance to the religion of democracy but it is likely to be tense.Burkina Faso will vote for the first time after a popular uprising which waved goodbye to President Blaise Compaore. You may think then that all will be sweetness and light there but the army, which had its say in the uprising, is still lurking in the wings.Michel Kafando may be the president, but Lt Col Isaac Zida, who briefly took power after President Compaore's departure, has stayed close to power. He is currently the prime minister and the minister of defence.There are more considerations, for example: Who will France and the US, both with special operations in the country, want to see in charge?Not everything then is in place to ensure a free and fair vote in Burkina Faso. And in most places where there are upcoming elections there is reason for concern.Democracy gives African governments legitimacy, but what else does it guarantee?The age of the despot getting 99.9% of the vote is a memory for most, but in some cases, especially in Libya, election winners can be challenged and are seen as weak. Democracy has sometimes given way to chaos.There was a lot of hope for South Sudan when it achieved independence in 2011 but democracy there has not yet borne fruit. The signs were always there, given the difficulty of her delivery, that Africa's youngest child would keep us all up for some time to come.Nigerians exercised the patience of Job in their millions, orderly queuing as the bureaucrats sorted out technical faults and dealt with the grumbles over voters cards.Many nations this year may not be as fortunate as Nigeria in her calmest election ever.There will be the inevitable disagreements about the ballot and how it was conducted. Losers will cry foul.So why do Africans in their millions bother to vote when so many variables can dilute the democratic exercise?They cannot take for granted the right to vote which was denied for so long.Despite the security concerns, and in some cases the futility of the exercise if presidents will not relinquish their grip on power, voting is still the only way to prove our citizenship.It is also the only way to bestow legitimacy on our fledgling states.The people want their right to make their mark, sometimes that mark is ignored, but in the best cases it brings about a momentous change such as in Nigeria.Millions of citizens in Nigeria will now have a different perception of democracy.
Kell Brook says Amir Khan 'talks to me like I'm nothing'World welterweight champion Kell Brook has criticised British rival Amir Khan for showing him "a lack of respect".Brook, 28, retained his IBF belt on Saturday and wants a bout with Khan, also 28, who has opted to fight USA's Chris Algieri next."Khan has no respect for me and looks down his nose at me, but I've done everything asked of me," said Brook."I'm an unbeaten world champion and deserve and command respect but he talks to me like I'm nothing."Khan, a former world champion at light-welterweight, has expressed a desire to fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in the future, but has said he may fight Brook "inside the next 12 months".However, Sheffield-based Brook, who has won all 34 of his professional fights, expressed his surprise at Khan's choice of Algieri as an opponent and told BBC Sport: "He is now fighting in my division and has not had many fights there as he used to fight at a lower weight."But now he thinks he can jump the gun and fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao before me, when I have earned the right to do so. I don't know who he thinks he is. It's about ego for him."Every fight fan in Britain and across the world wants to see me and Khan fight. We have a great rivalry, there's a big pot of money for him and it is for a world title. All they have to do is pick up the phone, but he doesn't want it."On Twitter, Khan defended his choice of opponent and said:  "Can everyone please wake up. I said the fight between me and Kell Brook will happen. When I think it's right. Look at who he fought last (Romanian Jo Jo Dan)."Seems to me Kell Brook is dying to fight me for the big pay day before he faces a half decent opponent and loses that IBF title."Algieri (only beaten once by Pacquiao and still 140 lbs WBO world champion) is still a better opponent than No No Dan."Two weeks after beating American Shawn Porter in California to win the IBF world welterweight title, Brook was stabbed in the leg in an "unprovoked attack" while on holiday in Tenerife."The toughest time was lying in a Tenerife hospital with no one speaking English, next to a window with the sun beating down and my leg tied up thinking I would never box again or even walk again," Brook revealed."It took every bit of shine off winning the world title. It was then about taking baby steps and it was a long road to come back."I was staring death in the face so there's no man that can worry me now. It was the toughest fight of my life.""He's a very good fighter, but he has been knocked out a few times when he has stepped up," said Brook."Timing beats speed and I'm very strong at my weight. I'm big, accurate, powerful, determined and very eager to land my shots on his chin."He has always been the golden boy since doing well in the amateurs and has had that tag above his head."He's been on this television show and that television show and that's great if you're a celebrity but I'm about hardcore boxing. He has so many million followers on Twitter and beating him would be a massive boost to my profile."Khan's team want him to fight Mayweather or Pacquiao for the money as if he gets beat he can still fight me. But if he fights me and loses he has got nowhere to go."American Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao from the Philippines hold the other versions of the world welterweight title and fight in Las Vegas on 2 May."I think Floyd Mayweather will beat Manny Pacquiao. Mayweather has the desire to win, he has never lost, he controls his fights and is on a real high," said Brook."Mayweather is about securing a legacy and he wants to win all the belts. so if he wins, I would be a strong favourite to fight him. I would go into the fight 100% thinking I can win.""I think of Prince Naseem Hamed, Chris Eubank, Nigel Benn, Frank Bruno and Lennox Lewis and I'm not in front of them yet, but I want to leave a legacy and have exciting fights," Brook added."At the moment Carl Froch is leading the way for British boxers. but he won't be here for ever and next to him is me. Everyone else is below me."
David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, Nicola Sturgeon, Nigel Farage, Leanne Wood and Natalie Bennett took to their podiums on Thursday to debate key issues for the Conservative, Labour, Lib Dem, Scottish National Party, UKIP, Plaid Cymru and Green parties respectively, ahead of the May general election.Moderated by Julie Etchingham from ITV News at Ten, the debate began at 8pm and lasted two hours, drawing a 31 per cent share of the TV audience and reaching a peak audience of 7.35 million to be named the highest-rating programme of the night.

It confirms the 27-year-old acted deliberately in killing the 150 people onboard the doomed flight last week. The second black box reveals data including speed, altitude and pilot action. It revealed the plane hit the mountains at a speed of 700 kilometres an hour, killing everyone on board, including three Britons.France's accident investigations agency said in a statement: "The analysis of the second black box of Germanwings A320 that crashed into the Alps confirms the purposeful nature of the action of the pilot in the cockpit in order to bring down the plane, according to a preliminary investigation." It added: "A first reading shows that this pilot in the cockpit used the autopilot to engage the aircraft down to an altitude of 100 feet, and on several occasions during the descent the pilot changed the autopilot setting to increase the speed of the descending aircraft." The results of the analysis of the second black box supports evidence of the first box which showed Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before crashing the plane.
Prince Harry is headed for his final tour of duty in the elite SAS headquarters in Perth, Western Australia where the soldier who claims to have shot the Taliban warlord who was intent on killing the royal heir works as a training commander.Mark Donaldson is one of Australia's most highly decorated soldiers, one of the very few to have been awarded the nation's highest military honour, the Victoria Cross, for his bravery in Afghanistan.Corporal Donaldson VC revealed in 2013 how four years earlier he had been a member of an elite Special Air Services unit ordered to assassinate a Taliban warlord who had boasted that he intended to kill Prince Harry.Known in the British military as Captain Harry Wales, the fourth in line to the throne will fulfill one of his dreams by embedding with the Australian SAS.The first threat to his life by the Taliban came between December, 2007 and February, 2008 when as a 23-year-old he spent ten weeks on his first tour of duty to Afghanistan in the southern province of Helmand guiding fighter jets towards suspected Taliban targets.In his book The Crossroad, Corporal Donaldson revealed how the SAS regiment had uncovered a Taliban fighter codenamed Javelin in Afghanistan in 2008.'Javelin had been saying he was going to take out Prince Harry,' he wrote. 'We flew by Chinook to a place called Paygolkar to go after two targets codenamed Longbow and Javelin. They were supposed to be important Taliban commanders.'On the first night time attempt by Donaldson and his fellow Australian commandos, they entered the compound where the Javelin was based, in Uruzgan province,a Taliban stronghold in central Afghanistan, but the commander got away.Almost a year later in 'an exact same type of job, at the exact time of night', Donaldson writes in The Crossroad, they shot him dead.'We went into Paygolkar one night, searching for codename Longbow. We went onto the roof of the same compound we'd been in the previous year and found nine rocket-propelled grenade warheads and a landmine.'We didn't get Longbow, but three Talibs squirted from the target building just before we were able to take it down. They ran straight into our cordon teams and were killed."One had a very nice chrome-plated, clean AK-47. He turned out to be Javelin, the target we'd gone after a year earlier in the same area. Further evidence established that he had a job helping high-value individuals coming in from Pakistan.'Prince Harry's first tour in Afghanistan was cut short after an imposed media blackout on his presence there was breached. He returned for a second tour in 2012, when again the Taliban voiced a threat to 'eliminate him'.Corporal Mark Donaldson was to have further brushes with Afghan fighters, being shot in the leg in 2012. In his memoir, he revealed more details of the incident in which his bravery had earned him the Victoria Cross.On September 2, 2008, just weeks after his first attempt to kill the Taliban warlord Javelin, the SAS trooper and twelve other Australians in a military convoy were ambushed by a large group of insurgents.One of the interpreters had been shot and was lying on the ground. Despite being advised not to go and help, Donaldson ran 80 metres to rescue the wounded man, while under heavy machine gun fire.In 2013 the prince visited SAS HQ in Perth to pay tribute to special forces troops killed in the line of duty, and is said to have met Donaldson.Next week, he will get his first chance to join the elite group and perhaps be trained in house-to-house combat using live rounds by the highly decorated soldier who killed the warlord who threatened the prince's life.Prince Harry will arrive in Australia next Monday to kick-off his final, four week long tour of duty.The royal's last tour before hanging up his fatigues and retiring from the armed services will also see him serve alongside Australian soldiers in Darwin and Sydney.The prince will spend time with Indigenous NORFORCE soldiers in the Northern Territory, and the Australian Army's Sydney-based 6th Aviation Regiment. If he passes military testing, it is possible he'll fly helicopters while with the Sydney regiment.The prince will join diggers on urban training exercises and bush patrols as well as pack marches and physical training.Before the military stretch gets underway, Prince Harry will travel to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra and lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Solider, according to an Australian Defence Force statement.A spokesman for Prince Harry said he had wanted to come to Australia on a military exchange for some time, and he was excited for a 'challenging and hectic' schedule.'Prince Harry is tremendously looking forward to starting his four week attachment with the ADF,' the spokesman said, according to the ABC.'It has been an opportunity he has been keen to explore for a couple of years now and is delighted to be able to do it before completing his military service with the British Armed Forces later this year.'The fourth-in-line to the throne royal will have his army activities briefly interrupted at the end of the month, when he flies to Gallipoli with Prince Charles for Anzac Day commemorations.The ADF confirmed Harry will be given down time off-base during his stint, meaning some lucky punters could have a pint with the prince.However, the ADF said it has created a very real experience for Prince Harry.'Defence’s focus for this attachment is to provide Captain Wales with an authentic military experience in the Australian Army that builds on his previous experience with coalition forces and complements his work with wounded, injured and ill service personnel,' a statement read.'Defence has selected units that best utilise Captain Wales’ skills and allow him to experience a broad range of Army capabilities. The attachment will also allow Captain Wales to share the experience and knowledge he has gained over 10 years of military service in the British Armed Forces, including two operational tours of duty in Afghanistan.'
This man is delivering all the Easter Eggs my friends and family owe meUnless you are of a particularly religious persuasion, Easter is generally now taken over by the Bank Holiday, going and getting drunk on a Sunday afternoon, and eating chocolate for breakfast - am I right?But this kind of attitude seems to completely skim over those of us who have diabetes. As a type one diabetic, most of my relatives completely forgot that I could eat chocolate, and therefore stopped buying it for me. Cue many a sad Easter Sunday morning.I got it when I was 11, just after starting secondary school. I went really weird over Christmas, started drinking 2 litres of water every ten minutes, and lost a lot of weight and couldn't see properly. And my hair started falling out, and I got headaches a lot and was too tired to do P.E. My mum took me to the doctors, and they did a test, and I had diabetes.I didn't really understand what it was, and for a panicking ten minutes I asked the doctor 12 times if I was going to die. To which he replied, everyone dies, which didn't calm me down at all.But aside from that, it all turned out okay. I managed injections and blood tests, and frankly its all been fine. BUT, as a chronic illness that frequently aquires sensationalist headlines, there are some pretty irritating myths about diabetes, many which come out around Easter time.So as I mentioned, it gets to Easter time, and I watch all my relatives being given Easter treats, and I get none.It isn't true that diabetics can't eat chocolate. I can eat whatever I want, and succeed in doing quite successfully - four creme eggs on Easter morning circa 2014, come at me...All I have to do is check how many carbohydrates are in whatever I'm eating, and do a quick injection for it. Sorted, no issue.It would be quite a 1940s style existence if all type one diabetics couldn't eat chocolate.As my GCSE science teacher once shouted on a Friday morning, "if you have diabetes, you can never go and get truly hammered with your mates. You will be the sober one at your own stag party."It's not advised that you go out every night, and it isn't for everyone, but it's fine to have a drink.Alcohol makes your blood sugar levels rise and fall erratically, which can make you feel Ill, so it's good to steer clear of alcopops. But stuff like wine, or beer and cider, or spirits and diet mixers are fine. As long as your pals understand what you are like drunk, and when you have a diabetic episode, you should be fine. Shout out to the pals in Maga 2013 for sorting me out after that first night out, by the way.This attitude probably stems from sensationalist headlines NEVER differentiating between the two types of diabetes - but, type 1 diabetes, which people get diagnosed with most commonly before the age of 35, has literally nothing to do with weight.No one knows what causes it.Your pancreas just packs in one day and stops producing insulin, which converts the sugar in your blood to energy, and that's that.Type 2 is different, in that it's mainly an older demographic that gets it, and it can be caused by being overweight. And differently to type 1, its usually that you produce less insulin, or the insulin is less effective, rather than producing none at all.Type 1 is controlled by injections of insulin to emulate normal production, whereas type 2 can be sorted with pills or diet control.When there's all these shouty headlines about diabetes epidemics, they are referring to type 2 diabetes, because the obesity epidemic has seen a rise in diagnosis.As its usually something you get quite young, it's SO DAMAGING to feel like you have to constantly explain you didn't get it because you were fat.Insulin injections make you put on weight more easily as well, so you end up with a weird relationship with your medication. It's the thing that's saving your life every day, but messing with your body image.And somebody reading trashy newspaper stories about diabetes and badgering you about your weight does not help that AT ALL.So I'm enjoying my food in Pizza Express, casually injecting in my leg - under the table I might add - when some woman taps me on the back and asks if I can do it in the toilets because her husband hates needles.I get that people do often have phobias of needles, and that's fine - but it's something I have to do, I'm always discreet about it, there's never any blood or carnage, and the needle is so tiny that you would have to be sat on my lap to even see it.So no, I will NOT go into the toilets because it's upsetting your husband.Tell him to sort himself out, the big baby.The reason that I know the carbohydrate count of most things is because I work out dosage from how many carbs I eat. I can eat anything up to 20 grams of carbs without injecting. So it's useful to know what has 19 grams of carb in, and what has 21 grams of carbs in.With diabetes you need to avoid either the extremes of high blood sugar or low blood sugar. There's a risk you can end up in a coma with either situation. So, for ages after I got diabetes, I was scared that I would have to live in a granny annex in my parents' house forever in case I got a low blood sugar in the middle of the night.Thankfully, I did move out, and I have had low blood sugars and I successfully treated them and went back to sleep. No big deal.The attitude that with diabetes you can't be independent, go on holiday, and generally boss life, are pretty outdated now. You can do whatever you want as long as you control your diabetes and it doesn't control you.Just like you can eat all the Easter eggs you want on one day a year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Mozilla Corp, creator of the popular Firefox web browser, said on Thursday it would follow Google Inc and no longer recognize new certificates of trust issued by a Chinese Internet agency.Google's Chrome and Mozilla's Firefox are some of the world's most widely used browsers, and the moves could disrupt users accessing a broad range of Chinese web sites.As a result of Mozilla's step, users of Firefox may get a warning when attempting to visit sites certified after April 1 by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), the body that administers China's Internet by allocating and certifying IP addresses and web domain names.CNNIC issued a statement on Thursday calling Google's move "unacceptable and unintelligible" and asked the web giant to consider its users' interests.Zhang Jing, a representative of CNNIC's media relations department, could not immediately provide comment about Mozilla's move when reached late Friday.Mozilla and Google have both objected to CNNIC delegating its authority to issue certificates to an Egyptian company called MCS Holdings, which mishandled the matter last week.MCS Holdings attributed a security lapse that took place on a test network to human error.Internet authorities around the world issue certificates of trust to websites to verify their authenticity when visited by a web browser. Hackers could in theory impersonate unverified websites and intercept data using a "man-in-the-middle" attack.Google and Mozilla have said they would allow CNNIC to reapply so its certificates could be recognized again.Chrome is the world's most popular desktop and tablet browser, with nearly 50 percent share, while Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer has nearly 18 percent compared to Firefox at 16.9 percent, according Statcounter.
Labour announced the plan a day before it launches its election manifesto, setting out the policies which party leader Ed Miliband hopes will win over enough voters to oust Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron in what is expected to be the closest national ballot in decades.Labour's Ed Balls, the man who would become finance minister if Labour formed the next government, said the current administration had not done enough to close loopholes that allow wealthy individuals to legally reduce their tax bills."It will take a Labour government to call time on this lax approach and launch an assault on tax avoidance," Balls said in a statement.On Wednesday, Labour won public approval with a plan to scrap 200-year-old tax rules that allow individuals to avoid paying tax on income earned overseas. An opinion poll carried out after the announcement showed 59 percent of voters supported the plan.Balls said on Sunday that he would go further if the party won power, promising to target rules on private equity firms and hedge funds, increase fines for those found to be in breach of the rules, and give tax authorities new powers."Our 10 point plan will take the tough action needed to help us get there and we will start on day one of the next Labour government," Balls said.The Conservatives have said they would raise 5 billion pounds per year in the next parliament by cutting tax avoidance and evasion.Conservative junior treasury minister David Gauke said Labour lacked credibility on the issue because they had failed to act when the party was in power between 1997 and 2010."Ed Miliband and Ed Balls turned a blind eye to aggressive tax avoiding and evading for 13 years when they were in charge - they were the tax avoiders' friends," he said.
Police have released CCTV of the three men suspected of a ‘highly audacious’ raid on a safety deposit firm in Hatton Garden over Easter weekend.The gang carried out the burglary in two separate visits, police revealed, and there are at least six men taking part in the raid at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit LTD’s building in London’s jewellery quarter.The force insisted it had already recovered the footage ‘at the earliest opportunity’ but refused to comment on why it was only released after being published by the newspaper.Police are still waiting to carry out a face-to-face interview with the owner of the safety deposit company because he is overseas but officers have spoken to security staff working at the building.Earlier the Metropolitan Police admitted officers were told a burglar alarm had gone off at the scene but decided it did not require a response.MORE: Hatton Garden: Scotland Yard launch investigation into why police did not respond to alarmMORE: Holborn fire ‘may have been started by Hatton Garden burglars’The force claimed it was ‘too early to say’ if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the burglary.The CCTV images released by police show one suspect wearing a yellow hard hat, high-vis jacket, with black gloves and he appears to have grey hair. He is pictured manoeuvring a blue wheelie bin.Another suspect is wearing a blue Adidas jacket, with his face covered, and is carrying two red tools.The third suspect’s face is also covered. He is seen carrying a black bag over his shoulder and is wearing gloves. Another image shows a white van outside the building.A Met police spokesman later confirmed they were looking for more suspects in connection with the raid.Detective chief inspector Paul Johnson said the images showed the three suspects using a side door to enter the building after arriving at 9.19pm on Thursday, April 2, before leaving the following morning at around 8.12am.The men then returned on Saturday, April 4 at 10.17pm before leaving the next morning shortly before 6.45am, police said.‘They were highly audacious entering on two occasions over that weekend, ‘ Mr Johnson said.‘This footage, along with other material, was already recovered by police at the earliest opportunity, and continues to be evaluated to capture the precise movements of the suspects.‘I would appeal to neighbouring businesses, or members of the public who are either witnesses or in possession of CCTV footage, to contact us with information to support this inquiry.‘The examination of the scene has been painstaking and will continue into next week. These examinations are vital in order for us to arrest these thieves and we must exploit this one-off opportunity to the fullest extent.‘I appreciate that this has been a frustrating process for all those affected by this crime, and I would like to thank them and ask for their continued support in the investigation.’It emerged earlier that a security firm had contacted the Metropolitan police about an intruder alert shortly after midnight on Good Friday, but the call was graded in a way that meant that ‘no police response was deemed to be required’.It was not until Tuesday morning – more than four days later – that the audacious raid in London’s jewellery district was discovered.Detectives found that of the 72 safety deposit boxes that had been opened, five were vacant and 11 were due to be ‘drilled out’ due to non payment of fees, meaning officers were attempting to contact a total of 56 box holders. So far the force has contacted 42 security box holders.
Lenzie Rugby Club’s Mayfest was held for the first time last year.The event was so successful that the club is planning another festival next month.A club spokesperson said: “Last year’s event was a great success and we are planning to make it a little bit bigger this year, with more choice of ales and a bigger mix of music. But the format will be very similar.“The festival kicks-off at 6.30pm on Friday, May 8 with beer, music and food, then moves on to the big day (Saturday) with a senior rugby match, hog roast, music and beer tent. Sunday will be more family oriented with youth rugby, a boules competition, food and open mic session.”
And to think his day included a 10-yard pass, under no pressure whatsoever, straight to the opposition when an attack was on in the first half.That's the mixed bag you often get with this fella, but now and then he can produce the kind of second half that enlivened Upton Park on Saturday.Not to be denied after coolly dispatching two goals disallowed for fractional offsides, his moment of glory arrived with just seconds remaining in the five minutes of allotted stoppage time.And his moment was all about strength, pace, determination, awareness and the balance to deliver a firm, accurate shot across the keeper and into the far corner.One of the moments of the season.

Three people are stranded somewhere in the Hauraki Gulf, after their 22ft fibreglass boat ran out of fuel.Police Inspector Kerry Watson said a call was received just after 6pm Sunday, saying the boat was anchored but in need of assistance.They lost contact with the sailors while they were on the phone but Watson said they were not too concerned as conditions out on the water were understood to be calm."It shouldn't be too long before we find them and it didn't appear that there was going to be too much of a drama," said Watson.Three coastguard vessels and a police boat were going to continue their search until they found them.
As the daughter of actress Nanette Newman and film director Bryan Forbes, and the wife of a super-rich banker, Emma Forbes was never destined for a life on the breadline.But even she has astonished her showbusiness friends by buying a £27 million London mansion – for cash.The four-storey home has five kingsize bedrooms, five bathrooms, an underground pool, a gym, and a lift to take cars to the basement garage.But it is not to everyone’s taste – one neighbour has described it as looking like a ‘down- market mortuary’.The purchase comes after Ms Forbes, 49, who provided the voice of Mummy Hippo in the popular children’s cartoon series Peppa Pig, made a handsome profit on the sale of her previous flat, in Chelsea.Land Registry documents show that she sold that seven-bedroom home for £43 million in February.She and her hedge fund boss husband Graham Clempson, 51, had bought it for £18.5 million in 2007, before spending large sums on revamping it.Registry records show there is no mortgage on the couple’s new home.Ms Forbes and Mr Clempson moved into her new-build house with their children, Lily, 19, and Sam, 16, in February.Neighbours have expressed mixed views about the house, which was completed this year after a two-year build. It replaced a red-brick mansion with a neo-classical facade that was torn down by the previous owners.Although the architects said they designed the new yellow-brick house to blend in with other Victorian and Georgian townhouses in the conservation area, some residents complain that it ‘just sticks out’.One neighbour said: ‘Apparently the council approved it, which is outrageous.‘In an area like this it’s important the buildings fit a certain look. But it just sticks out, it doesn’t look like anything that belongs here.’Another resident added: ‘It looks like a downmarket mortuary. There was more taste to how it was before. Now it looks like a council estate.’London property developers have revealed that the sale of Ms Forbes’s previous apartment for £43 million made it one of the most expensive flats in the UK.The priciest apartment in the UK is believed to be in the One Hyde Park development in Knightsbridge, which sold for £140 million last year.Tristan Ward, a solicitor acting for Ms Forbes and Mr Clempson, said it was ‘inaccurate’ to say that she made a profit of £24.5 million on their previous flat as the couple spent considerable amounts of money refurbishing it before selling it.Mr Ward added that his clients’ property affairs were a ‘private matter’.Ms Forbes’s mother, 80, is famous for her roles in the 1970s British film classics The Stepford Wives and International Velvet, both of which were directed by Mr Forbes. He died in 2013.
Hillary Clinton is expected to announce her 2016 campaign bid todayI think she would be an excellent presidentSeven years after her bitter defeat to President Barack Obama, the former secretary of state would enter the race as the Democratic Party's overwhelming favourite following an 18-month campaign slog.The one-time first lady is expected to announce her news over social media - perhaps on Twitter - accompanied by a campaign video, which highlights her economy-focused political campaign.This is likely to trigger a vast network of supporters who have long-awaited her entry to the 2016 election race.It is understood that Clinton's campaign-in-waiting has been organised behind the scenes for months.This comes after Mr Obama said Clinton would make "an excellent president" during a speech in Panama City on Saturday.
The protesters had been camped out for nearly a week on the 38,000-tonne Polar Pioneer platform, which they boarded 750 miles (1,200 kilometers) northwest of Hawaii after reaching it using inflatable boats from the Greenpeace vessel "Esperanza."The rig, which is being transported by a heavy-lift vessel, is on its way to the Arctic as part of its exploration plans there."We're pleased the court agreed to grant a restraining order against Greenpeace," said Shell spokeswoman Kelly op de Weegh."It's unfortunate we had to pursue this legal action but we don't want a repeat of previous illegal stunts, including the group's illegal boarding on the Polar Pioneer drilling rig, this month."These tactics are not peaceful protests. They jeopardize the safety of the people working on board and the protesters themselves, especially aboard a moving vessel at sea."Shell was "open to an honest discussion about the challenges and benefits of exploring for energy in the Arctic," the spokeswoman added, "but we cannot condone Greenpeace's unlawful and unsafe tactics."Greenpeace confirmed that the six activists -- from the United States, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, Sweden and Austria -- had abseiled off the drilling rig and into inflatable boats, before returning to the Esperanza, which had been stationed nearby.It said they had left because of worsening weather.Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA, said: "It's astounding that Shell seems to think it has the right to jeopardize our environment and our economy, without being accountable to society."I thank the climbers for being society's eyes and ears on Shell's rig, letting them know that millions of us are watching their every move, because there is simply no such a thing as 'safe' drilling in the Arctic."
Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini has admitted that his side have thrown their season "into the garbage".Heading into 2015 they were well placed, having moved level with Chelsea at the top of the Barclays Premier League table.However, since then City have been eliminated from both the FA Cup and the Champions League while defeats against Arsenal, Liverpool, Burnley and Crystal Palace have all but ruled out their chances of retaining the league title.Pellegrini, quoted in several national newspapers, said: "It has not been a good season. It was not so bad until the end of 2014, when we were top of the table and also had the FA Cup and Champions League."But in the last three months we have thrown it into the garbage."I think always for the fans it is important to finish as near to the top of the table as you can and that's what we must do."City captain Vincent Kompany turned 29 on Friday, while players such as Yaya Toure, Pablo Zabaleta, Aleksandar Kolarov, James Milner, Edin Dzeko and David Silva are all also now senior statesmen within the group.Much has been made of the age of the City squad, but Kompany insists that major changes are not needed at the Etihad."This team doesn't need ­restructuring," he said."I would say it's more about refocusing. These criticisms about age come and go with form. If you are in good form and you're having a good season, then people say it's your experience that got you there."If you're having a bad run of form, like we are now, then age is the problem."We have to think outside of what people say. We've not been as good as we could have been. That's the bottom line and we need to solve that. But I can only speak from what I see and, looking around the dressing room, I haven't noticed that this team is coming to an end."
Doctors at Lufthansa had recommended that pilot Andreas Lubitz, suspected of deliberately crashing a plane in the French Alps, be given psychological treatment after he suffered a bout of depression, a German newspaper has reported.Citing documents found by Germany's air transport authority, the Bild am Sonntag said the doctors wrote that "Lubitz should continue to receive psychological treatment, even though he was deemed fit to fly" by an independent expert in 2009.Lubitz had interrupted his flight training in 2009 and had told Lufthansa about his illness.The report does not specify if Lubitz had indeed benefited from continued treatment.A Lufthansa spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Bild.French investigators believe that Lubitz deliberately slammed the plane operated by Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings into the French Alps on March 24, killing all 150 people on board.Germany's air transport authority said it never had access to Lubitz's medical files, and was only able to examine them three days after the crash.German prosecutors have said Lubitz was diagnosed as suicidal "several years ago", before he became a pilot, but had appeared more stable of late.Doctors had recently found no sign that he intended to hurt himself or others, but he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash.Police found torn-up sick notes during a search of his apartment after the crash.
Steven Pienaar of Everton in action with Angel Rangel and Nathan Dyer of Swansea CityThe main positive from Everton 's draw at Swansea was the return of Steven Pienaar .The South African has been out for almost four months, and with him it has certainly been a case of not knowing what you have got until it has gone.Steven has got real quality and any team would miss that.It is probably too late for him to make a massive impact on this season but he will be determined to remind everybody of what he can do.He certainly did that at the Liberty Stadium, when from the moment he came on as substitute for Leon Osman he brought a touch of class and composure.Ossie has also been a big miss this season when out injured.At the start of the season we spoke about Everton having a very strong squad, but when you get four or five injuries and key players are missing, you need the kind of experience an Osman or Pienaar can bring.They are both the wrong side of 30 and know they aren't going to be playing 30-odd Premier League games a season.But if you can count on them 15-20, then Roberto Martinez would be a happy man.Their wise heads also make them invaluable during training to help bring the youngsters on. That's how young players learn, from being alongside the senior professionals on a daily basis.The draw with Swansea was a fair result.To be honest, it looked like a typical end-of-season game between two teams who aren't going to be relegated and aren't going to challenge for European qualification.You get those. And while I wouldn't say they had their flip-flops on, neither team played with intensity they might have had there been more resting on the outcome.It's actually important we continue to press on over the last six games.Maybe in the past we have thought about throwing a few youngsters in to see how they go, but with increased prize money with every league position, every game now counts.The higher up the league we finish, the more money we will be awarded, and the stronger Martinez's hand will be during the summer transfer window.Arouna Kone certainly looked like he had a point to prove at Swansea, even if he overstepped the mark on occasion.That said, you'd rather players tried too hard than look like they weren't even trying at all.It's important Kone stays fit now. If he gets a good pre-season behind him in the summer, the next campaign could be a big one for him.Even Kone himself would admit he hasn't taken taken Everton by storm. And he was a little fortunate not to see red for his challenge on Federico Fernandez.There's been a bit of a debate this week over whether being out of Europe will benefit Everton.I'm of the opinion it can never be of benefit.The club deserve to be in Europe. The fans want it, and the players should to.If playing two games a week is something you struggle with, then perhaps you shouldn't be playing for a club of Everton's stature.We've had some great European nights in the past and, when I was at Goodison, we didn't really seem to have a problem jugging the extra demands. In fact, we often thrived on it.There are plenty of reasons why we haven't managed to match our domestic form of last season.For a start, it's fair to say the league is stronger in terms of the level of competition at the top end.Jose Mourinho now settled back at Chelsea, Louis van Gaal is putting his ideas across at Manchester United, Manchester City are always going to be there, Mauricio Pochettino is starting to make Tottenham click while Ronald Koeman has done a great job at Southampton.There's no doubt we haven't performed as well as we can do, whether that is individually or as a team.But there's certainly no crisis. I'd expect us to be a lot stronger in the Premier League next season.Yes, there is the fact not being in Europe will help us to improve domestically.But with the size of our squad and the quality we have, we should be able cope with the Europa League.It's what the fans want. And it's what the players should want too.For anybody who wants to know how far John Stones has progressed in such a short time, consider this.Reports in Spain last week suggested the Everton youngster was among several centre-backs Barcelona were considering making a move for last summer.In the end, the Catalan side opted for experienced duo Jeremy Mathieu and Thomas Vermaelen.But it is high praise for Stones that the Spanish giants have him on their radar.I'm not surprised. You could go to every Premier League club and I'd guarantee you John Stones has at one time been on their list of possible signings, whether that be when he was starting out at Barnsley or during his time at Goodison.It would be the same for if one of our lads here at Brentford breaks into the first team earlier.Everyone is alerted. And everyone flocks to come see them to make their own judgement.Stones's profile has no doubt benefited from his good performances with England, and there's no doubt he has the quality.Now he is cutting out the errors and is becoming more consistent. Certainly, nobody at Everton really talks about him being a young up-and-coming defender now. He's established.Everton have struggled this season defensively in that we haven't been able to keep a settled back line due to injuries to key players, including Stones.It's meant the team has picked itself on occasion, regardless of form.But now Stones is back alongside the familiar faces of Jags, Bainesy and Seamus with Tim behind them, he is delivering regularly.
Parents Craig and Bonnie Morgan want their children to have the best possible start in life. And like many others, they have come to believe that a private education is the best way to achieve it.But so desperate are they to get their son Craig – known to them as CJ – into a local prep school that they’ve put their house on the market in order to pay the fees.And that’s not all. They’ve also slashed their weekly grocery bills by more than half, taken in lodgers, and have pinned their hopes on a ‘crowd-funding’ initiative, hoping members of the public will help them achieve their dream.‘We believe any child will benefit more from what a private education has to offer,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘There is simply no comparison.’The Morgans, from Hastings in East Sussex, settled on the idea of a private education for their children after CJ, who they say is academically gifted, found that he wasn’t being stretched at his state primary school.‘We always knew CJ was very bright,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘By the age of two he could recite the continents and at nursery he was identified as gifted and talented.‘By six he knew what every road sign meant and was reading paperbacks. Teachers say he is at least two years ahead academically compared with other children of the same age. And we’ve been told if he continues as he is doing with his maths, he is likely to gain a maths scholarship when he goes to senior school.’Despite his success at the local school – rated as outstanding – the Morgans felt he was too bright for state education and not achieving as much as expected.And then, they say, came a problem with playground bullying. ‘He won a trophy for his go-karting hobby and after taking it to school he was constantly taunted by two boys,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘He started coming home in tears.‘The final straw came when one yob yelled in his face and another punched CJ for nothing. The staff agreed it was an unprovoked attack but CJ no longer wanted to go to school. He started biting his nails and becoming withdrawn.’Heartbroken, the Morgans kept their son at home and contacted their local council to see if he could be transferred to a different primary school, but no places were available.Eventually in August 2014 – and with CJ refusing to return to his state school – he sat the entrance exam for Battle Abbey Prep School.Mrs Morgan said: ‘He sailed through the exam and when we looked round the school, we all fell in love with it. There is a big emphasis on good manners there – something that simply wasn’t emphasised as important at CJ’s old school. He loved it and in September started as a day pupil.’But at £4,000 a term, the fees were crippling for the family, particularly as their income depended on Mr Morgan’s work as a taxi driver. However, having seen their son join the choir and become part of the water polo and hockey teams, all within just a term, the family decided to cash in the only real asset they possessed.‘Our net monthly household income is £2,300,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘After bills and the mortgage have been paid, I’m often left with just £50 a week for food. But we just want the best for CJ.‘Friends and family can’t understand why we are giving up everything. They think we are mad to pauper ourselves to give CJ – and ultimately his four-year-old brother Alfie – a private education.’As well as putting their house on the market, the Morgans have taken in a number of lodgers and have set up a ‘gofundme’ account in the hope of attracting donations of £115,000 from the public.‘Holidays are out and even day trips aren’t possible as we can’t afford the petrol,’ said Mrs Morgan. ‘CJ and Alfie have given up their bedrooms so we can rent them out. It means they have to sleep in the same bedroom as Craig and me.’Private school fees are a growing problem for parents, with those on middling incomes finding themselves increasingly forced out.Since 1990, fees have quadrupled, with the average cost of sending two children to private school now estimated at more than half a million pounds. Even so, figures from the Independent Schools Council suggest that demand for private education is increasing.Mrs Morgan said: ‘The fees include extras such as some after-school clubs and trips. His uniform alone with its different pairs of sports shoes and PE kit cost us £500. We owe £9,800 on three credit cards but can only afford to pay off the minimum amount every month.’To help cut costs, the family’s £120 weekly grocery bill has already been slashed to £50, thanks to bulk-buying and plenty of home-cooking.‘Our clothes come from second-hand shops and we’ve even stopped the boys’ pocket money,’ Mrs Morgan added. Once their house is sold, the Morgans plan to rent a property, using about £85,000 of equity they have in their home to pay the fees.‘Ironically, as our mortgage is only around £200 a month and renting will cost about £1,000, it is going to add to our outgoings,’ Mrs Morgan said. ‘But this way we can sleep at night. We can clear our debts and, most importantly, pay for CJ’s school fees.‘Of course some people’s children are lucky – they sail through a state school and go on to become lawyers or doctors. Everyone has a choice and some parents would simply not want to make the sacrifices we are doing.But, the facilities, the ambiance, the atmosphere – it is all so much better than any state school. If your child is at a private school he is simply far more likely to reach his potential.‘Every day I pick CJ up from school he has a smile on his face. He is full of enthusiasm and inspired by his lessons.‘Craig and I will always know we did the very best we could.’To donate to CJ’s scholarship fund go to gofundme.com/qrbd8w
Two cars collided during the early hours of the morning (Sunday) in Kingsway, Hove.East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service and Sussex Police were called at about 3.40am.Fire crews cut two people out of one vehicle.

Fiat Group Automobiles South Africa, importer of Alfa Romeo, Fiat, Fiat Professional and Abarth vehicles in South Africa will campaign an Alfa Romeo GT 3.2l V6 “Squadra Corse” racing car in the Africa Endurance Series in 2015.The resumption of local racing with the head office supported Alfa Romeo Motorsport is being hailed by “Alfisti” as the premium brand has an illustrious history in South African motorsport.The return to the track is certain to evoke memories of the monumental on-track battles that were fought in the 70s and 80s with names like Arnold Chatz, Abel D’Oliviera and Nicola Bianca, to name a few.FGA’s previous foray into motorsport locally dates back to the Alfa Romeo 147s that were campaigned by the company in 2007 and 2008 and the brand’s heritage has been maintained right up until today by enthusiastic classic car racers.With the support of ADF Motorsport, the FGA technical team has built the race car in record-breaking time to ensure it is fully race-ready for its debut appearance at the first event in Port Shepstone on Saturday April 11.Alfa Romeo GT 3. racing car has been raced successfully in endurance racing internationally and will form the basis for the local race car.The use of a motorsport ECU manages the engine allowing the engineers to extract maximum performance while monitoring engine and driver statistics. Certain aspects can be controlled, such as fuel flow rates, air mixtures, engine timing and altitude compensation by adapting data acquired from the engine. This data is then manipulated via Motec software and fed back into the ECU to control engine performance as required.A performance engineered exhaust is also fitted to the car which also contributes to the performance gains from the engine.The Alfa Romeo GT is fitted with a 6-point safety cell that is integral to the safety of the occupants. This allows the technicians to control the suspension dynamics by setting up a perfect balance using weight distribution and the many adjustments in the race-bred suspension. This rigid structure stops any flex in the chassis allowing the shock absorbers to do all the work.The car is also fitted with FIA approved race seats; the driver’s seat includes head protection in case of side impact.The Alfa Romeo GT will be driven by Theo van Vuuren, John McLachlan, Martin Botha and Bradley Scorer.All drivers are required to hold an MSA Regional circuit license and a minimum of two drivers must drive the car during the race for the entry in events exceeding 90 minutes.
The limber and lithe contestants from more than ten countries on four continents hope they can shed the sport's association with seedy strip clubs and win respect as skilled athletes."Pole dancing requires technical content as much as gymnastics and acrobatics, and the level of difficulty is higher," Ke Hong, a member of the Chinese team — one of the strongest in the sport — told AFP ahead of the competition.He is one of over 50 contenders including more than a dozen men at the championships. They force themselves onto the pole for as many as eight hours a day to perfect their gravity-defying spins and poses.The scale of the competition reflects the growing appeal of pole dancing as a fitness aid over the last decade — with thousands of clubs estimated to have opened worldwide, including more than 500 in the United States alone.Chinese competitors said they had faced a tough environment of cultural conservatism while chasing their pole dance dreams — but that the long fight for recognition was finally paying off."My parents are farmers in the countryside, they do not know about this. I learned for four years, and the first three years they did not know, because I was working in a gym and I learned it secretly," said 2013 Chinese Pole Dance Champion Fang Yi.But now "many people see it as an sport. We are working hard at it, and hope one day it will be in the Olympics," the 29 year-old added.Some serious competitors insist that the sport be referred to as "pole" or "vertical fitness" rather than pole dancing, and claim that the discipline has ancient roots in Chinese and Indian acrobatics.Pole dancers have launched several petitions calling for Olympic authorities to add their sport to the next Games — so far without success."In past years, the bars have required dancers to be more athletic and it's no longer a sexual thing. A few years ago, it was more of a sexual thing, but now it's more of an athletic thing," said Chinese dancer Sun Wenzhu, as she painted a "wolf" mask to be used in her competition appearance.
Losing the first two games of the season for the first time in 11 years has only emboldened Geelong coach Chris Scott's conviction that youth is the only way for a team he regards as considerably behind the competition's best to start bridging that gap.Scott hinted after a 44-point home loss to Fremantle on Sunday that seasoned players could make way for Jimmy Bartel and Steven Motlop - who he didn't guarantee an automatic reprieve despite saying he had served his time for an off-field indiscretion."The guys who have played fewer than five, 10 games in our side, I don't think will be the ones that will be making way next week," Scott said after his team suffered its biggest losing margin at Simonds Stadium in nine years, and was only spared its greatest-ever loss to the Dockers by a late Mitch Clark goal."There's a big gap between us and the best teams right at the moment, but I think a lot of people would have considered that to be the case previously as well," Scott said."We need to focus on where we're at right now and improve our game, and over time bridge that gap between where we're at and where the best teams are at, because clearly it's pretty significant right at the moment."Scott admitted players who had become used to winning "week after week" found themselves in a different place, but said a positive of a campaign that has started with losses to Hawthorn and the Dockers was the new players who have come into the team."Recent history shows it's difficult, albeit not impossible to compete against sides that are much more experienced. We had some experienced players out there who aren't playing their best, and some of our young ones are feeling the heat of what AFL footy's like, but that's good for them. It's good for our future."Mitch Duncan and Steve Johnson had dirty days against a dominant Dockers midfield, but Scott did not rue the decision to suspend Motlop and play safe with Bartel - who passed all concussion testing and declared himself right to play."It's being disingenuous if you say good players go out and it doesn't hurt you at all," Scott said. "But the most important thing to us this week was that we clearly understood what we valued, what we stand for, what our values are, what are non-negotiables are."When they're not adhered to, we have to make a strong statement and respond."I'm still bitterly disappointed right now and the loss hurts but give me that decision over 100 times and we'd make the same one 100 times."While Motlop is expected to play against Gold Coast next Sunday, Scott looks set to make him sweat."Motlop still has to prove to us, and he's done a very good job over the last couple of days of proving to us he's going to respond the right way, but he's got to continue to do that before he comes back into the team."Fremantle coach Ross Lyon noted that Geelong had been "challenged", and described the Cats as a team in transition. Scott didn't disagree, saying they had been such since 2010 and hadn't shied away from that.The Dockers have concerns going into next weekend's derby against West Coast after Zac Clarke hobbled off with a knee problem in the last quarter, and with Hayden Ballantyne expected to be looked at by the match review panel after a clash with Harry Taylor.Geelong has Billie Smedts, who with Jed Bews struggled again to make an impact at senior level, on report for striking Lee Spurr.
Six-time Olympic gold medalist Usain Bolt has confirmed that he will race at the IAAF World Relays for the first time in his career.The 28-year-old has struggled with injuries over the past year, but he will form part of Jamaica’s team at the event which will take place in the Bahamas from May 2-3.“I’m happy to be part of the Jamaican team for the IAAF/BTC World Relays in the Bahamas,” Athletics Weekly quotes Bolt as saying. “I am fit, healthy and ready to run.“I hear the meet was a lot of fun last year and there was a great atmosphere.“Jamaica has a long and successful tradition in relays and when we put on the national colours we always do our best to make the country proud.”Jamaica have not yet announced who else will be part of their team.
Four-time Masters champion Tiger Woods says "anything can happen" on the final day as the American cards a solid 68 on the day three at Augusta.Woods picked up four birdies on the front nine and then picked up an extraordinary birdie on the par-five 13th when he looked certain to drop at least one shot.
The leading charity Age UK estimated last year that 900,000 people in England between the age of 65 and 89 have unmet social care needs, but experts at the charity now believe the figure is closer to one million.Caroline Abrahams, Age UK’s chief executive, said that the issue of social care was the single most important issue for elderly voters going into next month’s election. But she warned it was not being talked about enough and had been put in “the too-difficult box” by politicians.The reason for that, Ms Abrahams said, was, in part, because most of the current crop of top politicians may be “too young” to have seen the impact of social care cuts on their own parents.Forty per cent cuts to government funding for local councils, which provide the bulk of social care, have had a devastating impact on elderly people, leaving hundreds of thousands struggling with basic tasks.900,000 of people aged 65-89 in England who have an unmet social care need (Getty)New figures from Age UK reveal that more than 250,000 people who would qualify for help in the home because of difficulty getting up and down stairs are getting no support.Figures released by the charity in January show that 500,000 who need help with washing get no support, and nearly 600,000 who require assistance with dressing are struggling alone.The full extent of the state withdrawal of social care services is revealed in official figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), which show that 10,600 council jobs in adult social care – 8 per cent of the total workforce – were lost in just one year between 2013 and 2014. The figure has been decreasing at a steady rate of 10,000 a year since 2011, though this does not include those working for charities or private companies.Ms Abrahams, who leads Britain’s largest charity representing older people, told The Independent on Sunday, that the state was “running very fast in the opposite direction from older people”.“For them, this is a real personal disaster,” she said. “That pushes burdens on to families and it’s not good for the NHS either.“The importance of good social care really hits home when it touches you or those closest to you. From that point of view, it is notable that many of our leading politicians are only in their forties so they are probably too young to be seeing the huge value of social care for themselves.“But in 10 years’ time it is likely that many of them will be worrying about mum or dad’s capacity to cope as they become frailer and trying to see if they can get home to help as part of their busy working lives.”The disinvestment in social care, which has had more than £1bn pulled out of the sector since 2011, is viewed by critics as a false economy, because the burden of caring for elderly people shifts to the NHS.Hospital admissions are rising fast with 15.5 million patients admitted into a hospital bed during 2013-14 – 870 more every day than in the previous year. Admissions of patients aged between 65 and 69 – often on the cusp of requiring more intensive care and support – increased at the fastest rate, by 5.5 per cent.Trips and falls, which can often be prevented with social care support, accounted for 421,848 admissions, according to the HSCIC, up by more than 10,000 on last year, with the elderly by far the most likely to be taken to hospital for this reason.A lack of social care provision also contributes to delays in moving elderly patients on from hospital. According to an analysis by the Health Service Journal, there were 375,700 such delayed transfers of care over the winter – up by an unprecedented 23 per cent on last year.Many experts view this as the leading cause for overcrowding and long waits at A&E departments, and fear that cuts to social care could be to blame.Gary Porter, leader of the Conservative group in the Local Government Association but giving his personal views, said politicians in government had now admitted there was a crisis in social care – and understood that councils are not at fault for causing it because they do not have the funds to help. “There is an acceptance of it nationally,” he said. “When all the delays in A&E would be kicking off and that was a live subject around the cabinet table, we were able to give lots of evidence to defend local government. It looked like we were going to be scapegoated.”Age UK estimates that it would cost £3.36bn – only 0.22 per cent of English GDP – to meet the needs of all elderly people with moderate care requirements. Ms Abrahams said that decisions made about NHS and social care funding in the first spending review after the election could have “really profound” consequences for the future of elderly care.“We’re not talking about it enough at this election,” she said. “It’s the single issue affecting older people where you can most see something needs to be done. And it’s quite obvious what needs to happen, which is, along with some reform, that more money needs to go into the system.”
I had been his back-up for the election results programme – I was assigned by the BBC to help crunch his numbers and speak into his earpiece if he needed information while on air (he didn’t). My main memory of that night was of scrabbling under his desk trying to connect a loose cable to his laptop while The Unexpected intruded on the smooth preparations for the programme to go live at 10pm. With about 10 minutes to go before the polls closed and David Dimbleby introduced the programme, a rush of late information from the exit poll changed the prediction from Labour as the largest party in a hung parliament to the Conservatives with a small majority.For the first 90 minutes of the programme, everyone working on it struggled with the exit poll numbers and tried to work out why they didn’t show what everyone had assumed they would show for weeks before. For the whole of the election campaign, the polls had suggested that Neil Kinnock would be prime minister, possibly in alliance with the Liberal Democrats, a new party under a new leader, Paddy Ashdown. Then the results started to trickle in and it became clear that the exit poll was right.As Kellner and I stared at the rising sun and wondered what Labour had to do to win after four consecutive defeats (meanwhile Tony Blair, the party’s employment spokesman, was answering that question down the line from the BBC studio in Newcastle), we knew that the opinion polls had got it wrong. It wasn’t until weeks later that we understood more about why. Three things had happened. One was that the polls’ samples were too Labour, having failed to keep up with social change over the previous decade. Another was a late swing: people changed their minds in the last day or two. And the final problem was that some people, who became known as “shy Tories”, told pollsters that they didn’t know how they would vote and then voted Conservative.The first was easy to fix, and the pollsters fixed it. The second they can do nothing about, although forecasters have tried to predict this election assuming that there will be the same swing back in the Government’s favour that there has been, on average, in the past. Most forecasts, though, suggest that the Conservatives will still fall just short of the number of seats that they need to keep David Cameron in Downing Street. (Oddly enough, the opinion pollsters, when asked to predict the outcome in our Poll of Pollsters, say exactly the same thing.)There is the more general problem of opinion polls failing to pick up behavioural changes. In the Scottish referendum, for example, the final polls suggested that the No vote would win by a margin of five percentage points, but the result was that No won by 11 points (a case of the “shy Noes”?). If there were a six-point difference between the opinion polls and the result of the general election, that could mean either Cameron or Miliband winning a majority outright. I wouldn’t expect the opinion polls to be that far out: a referendum is a one-off event and strange things are going on in Scotland at the moment.At the last general election, the final polls suggested that the Tories would win by a margin of eight points rather than the actual seven. In the only other big recent test of opinion polls, the London mayoral election of 2012, Boris Johnson’s margin of victory over Ken Livingstone was similarly a little  over-estimated. That ought to worry the Conservatives.But there is the third problem that the pollsters faced in 1992, an election in many ways like today’s, in which a Tory prime minister sought re-election against a Labour Party that he said was too left-wing. It is possible that the shy Tories are back. There may be a slice of British society that thinks it is not done to admit to voting Conservative. They feel under social pressure to conform with liberal attitudes towards public spending, welfare and immigration, but in the privacy of the polling booth may vote differently.We have no way of knowing whether that is true this time until the exit poll is published at 10pm on 7 May. But the return of the shy Tories is now Cameron’s only hope. He thought that when the voters saw the whites of Miliband’s eyes they would recoil in horror, but it hasn’t happened. Instead, Miliband last week forced the Conservatives to defend non-dom status – a tax perk for the rich. As one senior civil servant commented to me, “even if God and the Queen came out for the Tories, it won’t stop this being Labour’s week”.Who knows if we will be watching the dawn break on 8 May to discover that the shy Tories have, against all expectations, put David Cameron back in Downing Street?The Independent has got together with May2015.com to produce a poll of polls that produces the most up-to-date data in as close to real time as is possible.Click the buttons below to explore how the main parties' fortunes have changed:All data, polls and graphics are courtesy of May2015.com.

Almost half a decade after the government introduced the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination, UTME, to encourage enrolment into the Polytechnics and Colleges of Education, students continue to snub the Polytechnics, while they expressly reject admission into colleges of Education. Medinat Kanabe who interacted with college administrators and high school graduates reports.Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME). That was in an attempt to find a lasting solution to the problems graduating high school students in Nigeria faced accessing higher education, and especially to even out the traffic of students to the various institutions of higher learning, as against the total preference for universities. The situation at the time had become such that students no longer considered the colleges of education and much less were giving consideration to the monotechnic or polytechnic options. It was either the universities or nothing.Even though Egwu did not last long enough in the office to see the policy come into fruition, it nevertheless got the blessing of the Federal Executive Council and promptly took off with the first examination in April 2010.The new system according to Prof. Sam Ukpabi, chairman of the examination board was to address the challenges of limited space in Nigerian universities and eliminate the phony rampart the students had inadvertently constructed to limit themselves. He also hoped it would change the history of tertiary education in Nigeria for good, with the youth of the country being the better for it.Before then, the situation had been such that JAMB (the Joint matriculation Examination Board) founded 1978 conducted a separate matriculation examination for the universities. That was later replaced with the Universities Matriculation Examination (UME), with the Monotechnics, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education Examination (MPCEME) introduced in 1989 to cater for all other cadre of schools. The introduction of the UTME therefore meant that the millions of candidates seeking admission into all higher institutions will be subjected to the same examinations.The new system, according to Prof. Ukpabi, has several advantages, including saving cost, since candidates no longer have to take multiple examinations. They also get to save energy, and there is a greater likelihood of the students gaining admission to at least a university, polytechnic or college of education, rather than wasting at home and waiting for another year.Most importantly, he explained that going forward; it will also help in dismantling the long-existing dichotomy between graduates of the universities and their counterparts from the polytechnics/monotechnics.Not much have changedBut have things really changed? Do high school graduates now willingly accept admissions into colleges of education for instance? Or do those whose preference has always been with universities now accept polytechnic or monotechnic admissions?A chance interaction with a group of colleges of education provosts during their annual meeting at the  Michael Otedola College of Primary Education,MOCPED Lagos recently, provided the semblance of an answer.According to Dr. Ignatius Ezoem, Provost, Federal College of Education (Technical) Asaba, the introduction of the UTME has not achieved much in terms of increasing enrolment into his college. Rather, he shocked this reporter with the news that it has actually continued to decrease.Even as he acknowledged that he, as a government employee, shouldn’t be criticising government policies; he nevertheless professed that “we must look for ways to address the lapses” that might have emerged there-from.He advised that the government should first address the issue of teachers’ welfare and elevate teaching to the level of profession, if indeed they want students to start seeing colleges of education in a different manner.“If a teacher is well remunerated and the condition of service is improved, many people will go to colleges of education because they want to be teachers. Right now nobody wants to be a teacher; everybody wants to be a lawyer, an engineer, a medical practitioner, a pilot, but nobody wants to be a teacher. The fear is there.  The age-long thinking that teachers are not well paid, that teachers are the downtrodden in the economy is still there.”His position was corroborated by the Provost, Federal College of Education, Zaria, Dr Maccido Mukhtar, who argued that the status quo would remain, “until such a time when government decides to implement teachers’ salary scheme.”“What I am trying to say is that you can be a professor but choose to teach in the primary school and get a professor’s salary. And if you decide to teach in the university, you will get the same salary. Once that is implemented and their salary is enhanced, there is no way teaching or teacher education will take a back seat. All over the world, they respect the teacher more than any other person. If you go to Japan, the highest paid salary earners are teachers. And so it is with many other countries; but as far as the rich and influential are concerned here, teaching can go to hell. The question therefore remains, if nobody cares for teaching, what happens to the schools?”Dr Bashorun Olalekan Wasiu of Adeniran Ogunsanya College of Education, Ijanikin, also agrees that the population is dwindling.The AOCOED provost’s suggestion however is that government should “train teachers for basic education. They might actually be given the mandate of training first degree students. They should be able to award degrees in education. That might be a solution and that might give the opportunity of being able to increase the enrolment and enhance the quality.”He also said the fact that they are teachers puts them in better stead to train teachers than the universities. “Students can then progress to the university for their masters and PhD.”Another solution, he said is to enrich our curriculum, with entrepreneurship programmes to benefit the students. “The students should be able to come out and be employers of labour when they finish because unemployment is everywhere. If the programme is enriched, students will not feel inferior to the university graduates,” he concluded.On her part, Professor Francisca Ladejanu of the College of Education, Ikere Ekiti insists that an average student will always prefer to go to a university, and next to that, a polytechnic. “Colleges of education come last (even on the form) and that makes it more difficult for us to get students that will make them first choice.“It is not that colleges of education are not acceptable to students, it is just that they see products of colleges of education as not enjoying the same social status like others in other higher institutions. If teaching profession is made more attractive, then more students will want to come into education.”Asked if she thinks candidates are scared of becoming teachers, she said “I don’t think they are afraid; it’s just that everybody wants a good thing. If someone gets something good out of his college of education certificate, the most obvious thing is he would advice others to do same. If teachers are well paid; if they enjoy good standing in the society; then more students will want to come into education.”Candidates thumb down for colleges of educationBenard Clement wrote the last UTME. It was the 20 year-old’s second attempt and he told this reporter matter-of-factly that “I cannot attend a college of education. I wrote UTME last year and scored 189. I could easily have gotten admission into any polytechnic or college of education but I decided to write another exam this year and I will continue to write until I meet the cut-off mark needed to go into the university of my choice.”Continuing, he said “In Nigeria, the NCE certificate is not recognised and I don’t want a useless certificate. I don’t want a situation whereby I will waste my time and money going to a college of education and at the end of the day I will be running up and down looking for a job.”Another candidate who has written UTME twice and scored 172 and 192 respectively; also told The Nation that he is writing again, albeit in fear that he might not score the cut off mark yet again. Speaking with a dint of regret, Saka Sadiq said: “If I had known I would have accepted the offer of polytechnic admission given me in the past sittings, because I am not sure I will score up to what I want this time.”Even then, he insists that “No matter what, I cannot attend a college of education. I can manage to attend a polytechnic but never will I attend a college of education. Even Bsc holders in Nigeria have not got jobs and you say I should attend a college of education, I will not.”17 year-old Habibat Rasheed is writing UTME for the first time, but she sure she will not attend a college of education. “The only thing that will make me consider a polytechnic is because it can afford me the opportunity to take a direct entry to the university and I will only do that because I wouldn’t like to just stay at home waiting to write another UTME.” She said.Habeeb Abideen however hates teaching, and makes no attempt to be civil about it. “I cannot even touch it with a long spoon. They are not well paid, they go on strike, and they are not accorded the right recognition in Nigeria. I can make the salary of a teacher in one week if I go into business; that is why I want to study business administration.”The Public Relations Officer for JAMB, Dr Fabien Benjamin took time to further explain to candidates why it was necessary to introduce the UTME, assuring them that with time, polytechnics and even colleges of education will be on the same level with degree holders.He explained that the problem of HND/degree dichotomy and the problem of people preferring degree over polytechnic and colleges of education led to the introduction of the UTME, “to bridge the gap so that we will have the same entry requirement.”“If you say that degree is the same with HND and you are giving them different entry requirement, then you have already told them from the beginning that they are not the same. So we want to ensure uniformity, the same three requirements, the same standard, the same, certificate, the same grading and the same consideration.“We want to encourage technical education because the polytechnics are established to enhance technical education and if you don’t give these candidates any reason to go to polytechnics or colleges of education, then they will not go.“A situation whereby somebody will go to the polytechnic and finish and you come and tell him that he is an educative officer and that a degree is far above whatever he has acquired would not encourage others to attend.”Asked why enrolment into these colleges has not increased since the introduction of UTME, Dr. Benjamin said any policy that is introduced must go through a process.“The board has taken up a step to unify the entry requirement and what the ministry of education is doing at the top level is to ensure that the HND/NCE dichotomy is completely eradicated. And they are seriously working on it, but it is not a magic wand that you just swing and it happens. It is a process and the candidates are also watching to see how employers of labour will react to this policy. So you’re not likely to get a different reaction from the students or schools, until it gets to the market and the market accepts it,” he explained.He also said that one of the measures being considered as an immediate incentive is to have the government make it such that “if someone has an HND, let him go straight to do his Masters. He does not have to do a Post Graduate Diploma first; and if you have an HND and are employed, you should be taken in as an administrative officer and also have the same terminal point with degree holders.”That way, he said, students will begin to have positive attitude towards polytechnic education.Responding to the clamour to make a degree the minimum qualification for teachers, Dr. Benjamin said: “That is part of the comprehensive policy we are talking about. What educationists want to do in Nigeria is for teachers to be able to teach well. You cannot teach what you don’t have and under normal circumstance, people that are teaching are supposed to be the best; and even if other companies are taking less than first degree, a teacher should not be anything less.“Government is therefore considering upgrading colleges of education to degree awarding institutions, so that teachers will come in, do their degree programmes and no longer NCE; and even if they do their NCE, they will be able to proceed immediately to do their degree programmes. That will very likely encourage them not to stop at NCE, but go further and obtain their degree.”He concluded that “Most people don’t want to go to colleges of education because they think all they would get is an NCE, but if they know that they can be awarded a degree, chances are they’ll go the long haul.”
Research from the US has shown that the most effective way of persuading people to vote is to have genuine, unscripted conversations with them.For that you need informed and personable activists, motivated enough to go out in all weathers to face rejection and dogs. Parties can’t pay canvassers, so elections can be swayed by volunteers. Traditionally, the Lib Dems have been best at mobilising canvassers, but Labour and the Tories are catching up, and the Greens and Ukip make up in enthusiasm for what they lack in organisation.Five doorsteppers helping decide the election share their experiences from the front line.Thomas Lydon, 23,  is canvassing for the Labour Party  in StroudBest experience? “When people are really complimentary and say they like what you’re doing, or when people say they hate the Tories.”Worst experience? “People slamming the door in your face and telling you to ‘f-off’. The worst (or funniest) is catching someone ‘in the act’. You get bitten by a dog maybe once a year.”Ever changed someone’s mind? “Yeah, because we’re in a very marginal seat. There’s a bigger sway here – it’s ludicrously close. You motivate people by saying, ‘You can make a difference.’”Has anyone made you doubt your party? “Not really. I think I wouldn’t go out and do what I do if I wasn’t sure of what I believed. The  main reason I do it is because I know the people standing for election.”Liam Walker, 24, is chairman of Witney Conservative Future and has been canvassing for the Tories for four and a half yearsBest experience? “I was talking to a teacher. She knew a former tutor of mine  and we got talking about apprenticeships.”Worst experience? “Getting sworn at and having the door slammed in your face. That happened at a by-election in Rochester, but people were getting so much through the door. The last thing they probably wanted to see was a Tory.”Ever changed someone’s mind? “I hope I’ve converted people. I’ve been doing it for four and a half years. If I haven’t converted anybody, then I’m in trouble.”Has anyone made you doubt your party? “In 2010-11 things weren’t going well. The economy wasn’t doing well but things have improved a lot. Generally people are very impressed with what’s going on.”Peter Thornton, 63, is a Liberal Democrat Party councillor. He is canvassing for Lib Dem candidate Tim Farron in CumbriaBest experience? “I knocked on the door with my leaflet ready. I started my spiel and he said: ‘Don’t worry, we’re voting for you.’ Four votes. No need for a leaflet.”Worst experience? “The thing we all fear is dogs – big dogs, behind big fences. You see these signs and you’re never sure if they mean it. You open the gate gingerly and if you hear a bark you shut it.”Ever changed someone’s mind? “On the doorstep it’s quite difficult. I spoke to someone who said they were voting Conservative nationally and for us locally.”Has anyone made you doubt your party? If you listen to people, then you do get different perspectives and, yes, sometimes you think, ‘Oh, I wonder if they have a point there?’ If you are listening with a closed mind, there’s no point.”Ozoda Muminova, 35, has been out for the Green Party for five years. She’s canvassing in Islington, north LondonBest experience? A little boy came to the door with his mother. He wasn’t interested in tuition fees but when he heard we want to make the streets safer to play in, he started clapping.”Worst experience? Canvassing on a sunny day is difficult – no one is in. I don’t get doors slammed in my face, though.Ever changed someone's mind? One lady was a card-carrying member of the Labour Party but she said she was really into our fair immigration policy, because her husband was an immigrant.Has anyone made you doubt your party? People are genuinely nice. They are positive towards the Greens and they know we are a nice party and not filled with hate.Best experience? “Three or four Labour people came along. Next thing, a lorry driver came past and hooted. He stuck up his thumb and said, ‘Up with Ukip.’”Worst experience? “You have to have a thick skin. Some colleagues have felt put-upon by the more plain-speaking people. Some feel a bit strongly but we’re not here to threaten or to worry people.”Ever changed someone’s mind? “There was a guy who didn’t agree with some of our political agenda but he came round because of what Ukip offer in terms of abolishing inheritance tax. He wanted to leave his house to his children.”Has anyone made you doubt your party? “You’re going to get some people, partly because you disturb them and partly because they’re inclined to vote for other parties. But that is democracy. You don’t worry about that and you don’t cause any grief.”The Independent has got together with May2015.com to produce a poll of polls that produces the most up-to-date data in as close to real time as is possible.Click the buttons below to explore how the main parties' fortunes have changed:All data, polls and graphics are courtesy of May2015.com.

If you want to do well in your exams, especially maths, don’t smoke dope.This is the finding of a unique study that is likely to be fiercely debated by those in favour of and those against the liberalisation of cannabis laws. Economists Olivier Marie of Maastricht University and Ulf Zölitz of IZA Bonn examined what happened in Maastricht in 2011 when the Dutch city allowed only Dutch, German and Belgian passport-holders access to the 13 coffee shops where cannabis was sold. The temporary restrictions were introduced because of fears that nationals from other countries, chiefly France and Luxembourg, were visiting the city simply to smoke drugs, which would tarnish its genteel image.After studying data on more than 54,000 course grades achieved by students from around the world who were enrolled at Maastricht University before and after the restrictions were introduced, the economists came to a striking conclusion. In a paper recently presented at the Royal Economic Society conference in Manchester they revealed that those who could no longer legally buy cannabis did better in their studies. The restrictions, the economists conclude, constrained consumption for some users, whose cognitive functioning improved as a result.“The effects we find are large, consistent and statistically very significant,” Marie told the Observer. “For example, we estimate that students who were no longer able to buy cannabis legally were 5% more likely to pass courses. The grade improvement this represents is about the same as having a qualified teacher and, more relevantly, similar to decreases in grades observed from reaching legal drinking age in the US.”For low performers, there was a larger effect on grades. They had a 7.6% better chance of passing their courses.Interestingly, Marie and Zölitz found the effects were even more pronounced when it came to particular disciplines. “The policy effect is five times larger for courses requiring numerical/mathematical skills,” the pair write.This, they argue, is not that surprising. “In line with how THC consumption affects cognitive functioning, we find that performance gains are larger for courses that require more numerical/mathematical skills,” Marie said. THC – tetrahydrocannabinol – is the active ingredient in skunk cannabis, which some studies have linked with psychosis.The groundbreaking research comes at a significant moment. The clamour for liberalisation of cannabis laws is growing. In Germany, Berlin is considering opening the country’s first legal cannabis shop. Uruguay plans to be the first nation in the world to fully legalise all aspects of the cannabis trade. In the US, more than 20 states now allow medical marijuana use, while recreational consumption has become legal in Alaska, Oregon, Washington and Colorado.But, as Marie and Zölitz observe in their paper: “With scarce empirical evidence on its societal impact, these policies are mainly being implemented without governments knowing about their potential impact.“We think this newfound effect on productivity from a change in legal access to cannabis is not negligible and should be, at least in the short run, politically relevant for any societal drug legalisation and prohibition decision-making,” Marie said. “In the bigger picture, our findings also indicate that soft drug consumption behaviour is affected by their legal accessibility, which has not been causally demonstrated before.”The research is likely to be seized upon by anti-legalisation campaigners. But Marie was at pains to say the research should simply be used to raise awareness of an often overlooked aspect of drug use: its impact on the individual’s cognitive ability. “If marijuana is legalised like it is in many states in the US, we should at least inform consumers about the negative consequences of their drug choices.”It will also feed into the debate about THC levels in cannabis, which are becoming ever stronger. Levels of THC in marijuana sold in Maastricht’s coffee shops are around double those in the US.“Considering the massive impact on cognitive performance high levels of THC have, I think it is reasonable to at least inform young users much more on consequences of consuming such products as compared with that of having a beer or pure vodka,” Marie said.History suggests that prohibition often results in the illicit drug or alcohol trade producing ever stronger products. Campaigners for liberalisation argue that it could help bring THC levels down and allow users to know what they are buying. The authors concede that their findings could turn out to be different if they were to replicate their study in a country that did not have restrictions on cannabis use.Marie said his work had helped inform his discussions with his teenage son. “I have a 13-year old boy and I do extensively share this with him as a precautionary measure so that he can make the best informed choice if he is faced with the decision of whether to consume cannabis or not.”
The Independent on Sunday has learnt that the coalition quietly shelved the idea of including the Queen Elizabeth II centre in a “for sale” list after ministers were told it was a “no-brainer” for it to become Parliament’s temporary home when the palace is refurbished. The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, recently warned that the palace, which is slowly sinking into the river Thames, will have to be permanently vacated within 20 years unless extensive work starts soon.* a post-election report will confirm that MPs and peers must move out while renovation work takes place;* the cost has probably been underestimated by around £1bn;* Parliament could have to close for longer than the five years mooted;* cleaning up the courtyards alone will cost “tens of millions” of pounds and take six years.Accountants Deloitte, architects HOK and engineers Aecom will soon publish a Parliament-commissioned report on the best option for organising the repair works when they start in around 2020.The cost of restoring the Palace of Westminster has been estimated at more than £3bn (Getty)A source close to the team said that the renovation would be “pretty comprehensive” so that either all of Parliament would have to be relocated, or the move could be divided so that MPs or peers decamp in turns. It is possible that one-term MPs might never get to speak from the Commons’ green benches.One option was to undertake repairs around politicians as they worked, but it is understood that this will be ruled out, given the delicate nature of restoring the World Heritage Site. Among the challenges is a tunnel running underneath Parliament that has become hard to access because of technology installed over the years, from telegraph equipment to broadband wiring.There had been speculation that Parliament could move temporarily to the North. However, it is understood that parliamentary commissioners, who include Mr Bercow, believe that the QEII centre is the most sensible option as, at 200m from the palace, it would cause the least disruption.While the refurbishment is taking place, MPs would not have to leave their offices in Portcullis House, or the Norman Shaw buildings next to Parliament. Those involved in the decision also point out that MPs need to be close to central departmental offices, such as those in Whitehall, and Downing Street.The QEII is owned by the Communities department. It could be configured to ape the confrontational arrangement of government and opposition benches, and has enough space to accommodate the most crowded of Parliamentary debates. A source said Communities ministers were told about three years ago that the QEII – which made a list of Daily Telegraph readers’ most hated London buildings – was the overwhelming favourite place for the relocation.A former minister said: “A request was made for the QEII Centre to not be put on the sale list until a decision is made on decamping Parliament during the rebuild.”Labour might try to sell the QEII Centre for around £25m if it wins the election, but a senior party source insisted that this would not stand in the way of renting the venue during the refurbishment period.Firms which have considered bidding for the renovation work say suggestions it would cost about £3bn may be an underestimate. A construction industry source said: “They don’t know what’s around or underneath Parliament, they don’t know what they’re going to find. We reckon it could cost 25 to 50 per cent more than the £3bn mentioned.”Also, it appears likely that the restoration will take longer than the five years mooted. Cleaning up the seven courtyards alone could take six years, and cost tens of millions of pounds. This could be undertaken as a separate contract, but a source said it would make sense for it to be part of the broader reconstruction work.The Independent has got together with May2015.com to produce a poll of polls that produces the most up-to-date data in as close to real time as is possible.Click the buttons below to explore how the main parties' fortunes have changed:All data, polls and graphics are courtesy of May2015.com.

MONTREAL -- Twenty-eight years after the Kanesatake Mohawk First Nation squared off against police during the Oka Crisis, the community's grand chief has not ruled out barricades to prevent TransCanada's Energy East pipeline from being built in its territory."It's possible because it's been helpful in the past," said Serge Simon. "At the moment, this isn't our strategy, but it could happen."According to the planned route, the pipeline will pass through the northern part of Kanesatake in Quebec."This year, we had four feet of ice on the lake," said Simon. "If an accident happens, how are they going to get down there to clean up the oil?"In an e-mail, TransCanada defended the project, saying "The East Energy Pipeline Project is an opportunity for all the communities along the route. We reiterate our commitment to maintaining an open, respectful and productive dialogue with all of them."Simon said he is opposed to the pipeline out of solidarity with First Nations in northern Alberta near the oil sands projects. A study by Environment Canada and the University of Manitoba found high levels of mercury and arsenic in animals and birds' eggs in the region and a University of Toronto report said the air is so polluted that it poses a cancer threat to those exposed."I can't take money from TransCanada and sleep at night," Simon said. "They can no longer use the excuse that we have no choice. It's an illusion. Alternatives to fossil fuels exist."
It took me a long time to get a full grasp of why the heavily armed and hooded civilian thugs and paramilitary operatives of the Department of Security Services (DSS) that were used by the PDP to cow the opposition and intimidate the general electorate in the Ekiti and Osun states’ gubernatorial elections of 2014 angered and revolted me beyond what words could express. At the time of these elections, I was far away in Germany as a Senior Research Fellow at the Free University of Berlin. For this reason, the distance from home perhaps greatly accentuated the emotions stirred in me by the accounts that I read and the images that I saw on the internet of these armed and hooded civilian and paramilitary thugs. It was bad enough, I thought, to use the privilege of incumbency to deploy men of the DSS to overwhelm the opposition. But why use hooded disguises? Did it not matter to the PDP that hooded and heavily armed men in the uniform of the state’s security services looked completely out of place in elections meant to be free, fair and open?Indeed, many questions raged in my mind. Why did the government, the PDP need to hide the faces of some operatives and not of others?  Were the hooded men actual members of a special unit in the DSS who had to be masked, who had to be hooded precisely because they were placed above all professional, legal and constitutional constraints – as some opposition politicians alleged? Were the hooded men even members of the DSS? Were they not civilian thugs deliberately hooded to hide their clearly illegal and sinister deployment within the DSS? After all, at the height of the Ekiti and Osun 2014 elections, many PDP chieftains went around with heavily armed and hooded thugs. What sort of democracy is it that openly and brazenly paraded and used hooded thugs right in the storm centre of armed state security operatives at the critical moment of elections intended to consolidate the moral and constitutional legitimacy of our democracy?It is important to emphasize here the fact that all these questions and the brooding musing that they stirred in my mind in mid-2014 all occurred before the revelations of the Ekiti-Gate scandal. With Ekiti-Gate, we finally found out that to the now defeated ruling party, there were absolutely no demarcations in the use of the army, the police, the DSS and the personal thugs of PDP chieftains to rig the Ekiti governorship elections; they were all not only interchangeable but closely coordinated. In other words, things that had baffled me in the images of the armed hooded goons of the DSS and the chieftains of the PDP became palpably understandable after the revelations of Ekiti-Gate. What do I mean by this assertion?Remarkably, the PDP was not only completely unembarrassed by Ekiti-Gate, the party in fact became emboldened by the revelations. After an initial denial, Fayose quickly admitted that it was his voice that the world could hear in the audio clip of Ekiti-Gate. He asked the opposition party to take the matter to court and see what happens. Jonathan went one step further and sent the name of one of the election riggers identified in the audio clip to the Senate for confirmation as a Minister in his outgoing cabinet. It was at that point that I came to the realization that the figure of the armed hooded thug, in uniform or in mufti, is the quintessential sign or symbol of democracy as incarnated by in PDP in general and Goodluck Ebele Jonathan in particular. Before bringing this piece to its conclusion with a succinct profile of this armed and hooded democracy of the PDP era, perhaps it might be helpful to deal briefly with the semiotic presuppositions of my reflections in this essay.In cultural theory and literary criticism as the principal areas of my professional, academic specialization, the field of semiotics interests me a lot but I confess that I am not a specialist in the field. This is why, as a sort of amateur semiotician, I limit myself to perusal of only the most resonant and iconic signs and symbols down the ages. Some of these include the Christian Crucifix, the Crescent of Islam and the Star of David of Judaism. To the adherents of these religions, these symbols evoke deep, even transcendental intimations of the ineffable. Far more secular but almost as soul-stirring for hundreds of millions of people for much of the 20th century was the Sickle and Hammer of the Communist movement, especially when supplanted on the normative bright flag of the movement. The Nazis reached all the way back to European antiquity to pluck the stultifying symbol of the swastika and it became nearly unprecedented in the symbolic power it could evoke both among fervent supporters of the Nazi movement and its most implacable opponents. In each and every one of these symbols, the image became so naturalized that the very moment one sees the symbol, like an automaton one thinks of the religion or the political movement.As a final word on this short review of the place of signs and symbols in some of the most influential religious and political mass movements in ancient and modern history, consider the following fact in the rather peculiar history of the Christian crucifix. Initially in Judea as a province of imperial Rome, the crucifix was regarded as the ultimate sign of a death, a fate that was so shameful, so full of ignominy that relatives and friends of anyone crucified in line with the universal perception that this was the colony’s worst from of capital punishment was more or less disowned by all connected by blood or friendship with the unfortunate victim who comes to his end on the cross. No form of death was considered more unfortunate, more destructive of one’s life and the memory of that life. It is thus one of the greatest ironies of religious and cultural history that this same symbol has been transformed into a potent and transcendent symbol of hope, redemption and grace.No such miraculous transformation will ever come to the image of the hooded, sinister thug in uniform or mufti as the quintessential symbol of the time of the PDP in power as the ruling party in our country. This is no doubt due to the fact that the official symbol of the PDP is the umbrella. But of greater significance is the fact that, at least as far as I am aware, no clear and indisputable image has emerged, has crystallized as the defining symbol of the years and decades of the PDP in power. There is the image of hundreds of people blown to bits in explosions that take place while the masses of poor people are scooping petrol from burst pipelines. But this image predates the coming to power of the PDP. There is also the image of the countless incidents of mass carnage on our roads. But this also did not begin with the coming of the PDP even if arguably, it rose to unprecedented levels in the PDP years.But think, compatriots, of the heavily armed and hooded men of the Boko Haram. That, indisputably belongs squarely and unambiguously to the PDP era. And it not only belongs to the era of the defeated ruling party, it in fact was appropriated by the PDP and used, as we have seen, by both the security operatives of the state and the thuggish chieftains of the PDP. Thus, I confidently predict that in the years and decades ahead when people think about the PDP, especially at the end of the line in Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, it is to this image of the armed and hooded thug that their minds will revert.It is symptomatic of the moral and functional bankruptcy of the hooded democracy of the PDP and Jonathan years that the recent successes and gains of the counterinsurgency campaigns of our armed forces were made possible primarily by hired foreign mercenaries and not through the work of the men and materiel of the armed forces themselves. The PDP and the DSS appropriated the hooded masks of the Boko Haram but lacked the morale and the effectiveness of that jihadist terror campaign. This bankruptcy, this lackluster non-achieving mediocrity was replicated on virtually every level and front of governance. The party, the government claimed to be fighting and defeating corruption even as the scope of corruption ballooned beyond all preceding levels. Claims of the creation of millions of jobs were made even as unemployment levels rose exponentially, especially among the youths, the human and demographic majority of our populace. Jonathan tirelessly mouthed his respect for law and order even as surrounded himself with an inner circle of lieutenants who showed and expressed maximum contempt for legality. Even as Jonathan himself and many of his megaphones touted his dedication to curbing waste, mismanagement and squandermania, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the most powerful and authoritative technocrat in Jonathan’s cabinet, stuck to her assertion that corruption was so endemic, so vastly entrenched in the government that she would be satisfied if by the end of her term in office she might have reduced the level of waste and corruption by 4%.Is it symptomatic of things to come that the President-Elect, Muhammadu Buhari, has expressed open contempt for the use of mercenaries to defeat the Boko Haram insurgency? I suggest that we must see the use of mercenaries by the military under Jonathan as another form or variant of the deployment of hooded and armed men in elections. The “hood” in this case is symbolic, not literal: most knowing commentators are aware of the existence of the foreign mercenaries but very few are talking about them. It is a very high benchmark for the dismantling of Jonathan’s hooded democracy that Buhari is setting himself by asserting that his administration will defeat the Boko Haram insurgents not with foreign mercenaries, but with reorganized Nigerian armed forces. One thing is clear and that is the fact that Buhari and the incoming administration will have to take the stripping away of the “hood” beyond the armed forces and its confrontation with Boko Haram to virtually all the other areas of governance and accountability in our country. This monumental challenge will be the topic of our reflections in the coming months and years as one ruling party succeeds another and clears the path for its own successes and or failures.
No matter how long it takes, the governor will pay for his illegalitiesToday, I will draw analogies from a drama by the popular Moses Olaiya alias Baba Sala, as well as two Yoruba proverbs which, in my view best describe the personality and the predicament of Governor Ayodele Fayose of Ekiti State in his current self-inflicted impasse. First Olaiya’s drama. Olaiya, in the drama in question, said he could slap a masquerade, slap a policeman and complete the madness by stoning a judge, all because of the godfather that he had in that drama. (Mo le gba eegun loju, mo le gba olopa leti; ma tun soko lu adajo), he had boasted. Really, with some godfathers, one can get away with anything, anything including blue murder! With President Goodluck Jonathan solidly behind Fayose, the Ekiti governor has gone away with many illegalities.Now, the proverbs. One is that of the hangman that would never want a sword dangled over his child’s head (abenilori ki fe ki a gbe ida koja lori omo oun). And the other, is that of a person who spat on the ground only to quickly rub it with his foot; it is because that person knows the evil to which spittle could be put (eni to tuto sile to f’ese raa, o mo nkan ti won nfi ito se). But before proceeding, it is better to expatiate to vividly drive home my point concerning the first proverb, for effect. In Yorubaland, masquerades are not regarded as ordinary human beings; they are seen more as heavenly beings. So, for a Yoruba man to say he would slap a masquerade is a serious matter because he is aware of the enormous powers they are supposed to carry as heavenly beings (ara orun). Add that to the fellow slapping a policeman. Mind you, it is the policeman that would be called to arrest him after slapping the masquerade. Then to want to complete the invidious act by stoning a judge! That’s the ultimate in the series of the impunities.These, basically, are the things Fayose has been doing since his return as Governor of Ekiti State in October last year. He had slapped a masquerade, slapped a policeman and even stoned a judge, at least metaphorically, given the many impunities he had committed since returning to the Government House in Ado-Ekiti. Governor Fayose has been uneasy since the 19 members of the state house of assembly (who fled the state due to the heat generated by their clash with the  governor) indicated their intention to return, early this month. We have witnessed all kinds of shenanigans and subterfuge to keep the legislators at bay, especially since the idea of the governor’s impeachment was mooted by the 19 lawmakers of the All Progressives Congress (APC). The governor has been doing what he knows how to do best, including issuing threats as well as organising protests to prevent the legislators from sitting.But, one big question in all these is whether the governor has committed impeachable offences. The answer, of course is, yes. Fayose instigated seven legislators in the state house of assembly to sit and remove the authentic speaker, Wale Omirin, whereas at least nine members were required constitutionally in the 26-member house. He reportedly brought in three unknown quantities that he alleged were members of the house. To date, the identities of the three remain unknown. Could he have been working on the theory that he could eventually get three of the APC legislators to his side to say they were the three unknown quantities in order to make the required constitutional quorum? If that was his plan, obviously, he has failed as the APC lawmakers have remained stronger, determined and united since their travails began last year. As a matter of fact, the state APC chapter had said only the seven Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) lawmakers in the house sat to remove the speaker as well as confirmed the appointment of commissioner nominees. It was the same pattern when Fayose wanted the consent of the state assembly for the 2015 budget. What has happened is that rather than find legitimate ways of getting the APC lawmakers back to do business, Fayose resorted to strong-arm tactics, using soldiers and policemen sometimes to do his bidding.That was why he did everything to campaign against General Muhammadu Buhari, the APC presidential candidate in the run-up to the elections. Fayose could not in his wildest imagination have thought of a situation where President Jonathan could lose the reelection, not to talk of conceding defeat even before the official announcement of the final result. Although the governor is not contesting any election now, he was one of those in my mind when I wrote a few weeks back that those waiting in the wings for President Jonathan’s crutches to scale the elections or continue in office after the sins they had committed under presidential cover would be disappointed because the president himself would need crutches to get reelected. I therefore did not see how he could be of any help to such characters who could not stand on their own. The life support that they were all banking on from Abuja has been cut off. Perhaps Fayose, even in his crudity could have been a little measured in his actions and utterances if he ever realised that this was the shape things would eventually take.The illegalities that he had committed can only be tolerated in a banana republic. Unfortunately, rather than call Fayose to order, President Jonathan preferred to look the other way, thus giving tacit approval to the governor’s impunities and encouraging him to commit even more. It is sad that this is the kind of thing Ekiti people in particular and Nigerians in general are subjected to in the twenty-first century. Nigerians must be grateful that President Jonathan has been stopped by being denied reelection; so we can be hopeful that never again would we see the kind of impunities committed by the likes of Fayose in the country. One could only have imagined what Nigeria would be like if people like Fayose are not denied oxygen from Abuja by voting out President Jonathan on March 28.Now, seeing his job is on the line, Fayose ran to the Federal High Court in Abuja to stop the APC legislators from doing their job. So, Fayose could still believe in the judiciary, the same judiciary that his thugs insulted and assaulted? Wonderful! Mercifully, the court in its wisdom has turned down this request.Without doubt, Ekiti people reserve the right to determine who their governor should be; but they should also understand that the state is a part of Nigeria and the country has its constitution which is the grundnorm. Whoever does anything contrary to the constitutional stipulations must be made to face the full weight of the law. That, for me, is the point we should be making. It is because Fayose himself knows the extent of the impunities he had committed that he is now afraid of the APC legislators sitting because he knows that would automatically result in his impeachment.We must lament a situation where the once erudite Ekiti people are now living by ‘stomach infrastructure’, a term coined by Fayose to show the limits of his knowledge at a time the rest of the civilised world is breaking new grounds in science and technology. Even our colleagues in the backbenchers’ league – Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia -  etc. are not living by bread or ‘stomach infrastructure’ alone. They have since abandoned us as a country when they see the kind of leaders we have been entrusting our lives to. If Governor Fayose is impeached this time around, he would make history as the first governor in the country to suffer such fate twice. This, perhaps, is not what is making Fayose nervous. More importantly, he is afraid of his shadows.His name (I)Fayose had worked for him to become governor twice and twice has he abused the privilege. He seems to have committed too many sins even for the Ifa divinity to forgive. This time around, there appears no incantation or propitiation that can rescue him because he has literally climbed the tree beyond leaves (o ti gun igi koja ewe). In simpler terms, he has stolen too much for the owners to notice. So, I am afraid, Ifa may not be able to deliver him as things stand. Fayose must get his comeuppance. Even if it tarries, it will surely come.
Chairman, House Committee on Finance, Hon. Adefunmilayo Tejuoso, is a lawmaker in the Lagos State House of Assembly. Tejuoso, who clocked 50, a couple of weeks back, is a graduate of Law from the University of Buckingham, England, the second female legislator to clinch the deputy speakership of the state house of assembly and the first female to get a fourth term in office. She revealed that she has learnt to be more cautious and careful with people. FUNSHO AKINWALE recently had an exclusive chat with her during her birthday celebration. Excerpts:How do you feel having spent half of a century on earth?I always say age is a state of the mind. I am not feeling old. I feel strong and alert. Life, they say, begins at 50. So, I am looking forward to more good times and more success in the coming year. I am excited because when people meet me, they don’t believe I am 50. I feel good that I am happily married wioth children who are getting older. I have a 19-year-old daughter, a 17-year-old son, a 13-year-old son and an eight-year-old son.Is there something you were doing that you can no longer do?No. I still wear my high heels. I still hang out with my children to movies, beaches, etc. I think with exercise, you don’t really miss anything. Once you are fit, you are fine. Maybe when I am turning 60 or 70, then I might be thinking of, ‘Oh, there are some things I was doing that I can’t do anymore.’ I don’t think at 50, there is a big difference to 40. At 50, you are old, of course, and wiser, but I don’t think there is anything you will really say you miss. There is nothing you want to do that you can’t do.How do you cope as a wife, a mother of four, a politician, lawmaker and a student pursuing PhD in law?I have always been a very active person. When I started as a lawyer, I had to wake very early to get to court early. Sometimes, you have to be at the Lagos High Court or Federal High Court in Ikoyi. You have to get to court early so that your case wouldn’t have been heard before you get there. So, if one has been used to a pattern of hard work right from youth, then it wouldn’t be a big issue when you grow old. I was doing all these and I am still doing them now. It’s even easier now because the children are getting older. My husband is an adult. He knows what he wants and he will demand for his rights, which are always available for him. So, there has to be that balance in all your responsibilities. Nobody said it is easy. Life itself is not easy. Everything you want to achieve, you must be ready to work hard to achieve them. The good thing about life is that when you are younger, you work very hard for your old age so that as you get older, you relax.What lesson has life taught you at 50?I have learnt to be cautious. I have learnt that you cannot trust everybody. I have learnt that the fact that you are upright doesn’t mean the next person is. Basically, I have learnt to be more careful with people. I learnt to accept people for who they are and not try to change them.People often have the impression that you are very arrogant and mean. How do you react to this?God has created us in different ways. For some people, the first impression they have of you is that you are arrogant. Arrogance is a perception; it is not who I am. I saw a movie the other day where I heard that fear is not real, but danger is real. You might think I am arrogant, looking at me from afar, but when you get close to me, you would see that I can speak and talk with anybody. I am the kind of person who gives back what you give to me. I don’t poke my nose into what does not concern me. If people want me to get involved, I would. But if they want their privacy, I give it to them since I sometimes want my own privacy. These all might be seen as ‘she is arrogant.’ Then, of course, I attended an all-girls secondary school and there are certain ways I have been trained to comport myself. I’m not one that would get anywhere and just open my mouth since, through my education, I know that a lady is seen and not heard; you don’t shout and make noise over the place. You just do your job. That is why you see that I like to work; I like to be at the floor of the Assembly and make my contributions to issues as much as I can. If I don’t have anything to say about an issue, I won’t talk.But I am always conscious of the fact that I am the voice of my constituency. They have given me the trust that I would talk for them. So when, a lot of times, you see me talk, it is not because of myself, because at the end of the month, I get my salary whether I talk or not, but the truth is that I represent people. When issues about domestic violence crop up, I get very passionate to ensure I contribute to make it a thing of the past. When we talk about issues of children, I worry and add a voice. I don’t want any law to come through my table and I would not do what I think is right on it so that, in the future, when they ask for what I said, documents would show. You don’t have to take what I say, but I want it to be documented for people to know I said what I said, especially for posterity sake. If I don’t talk and a bill is passed into law or a motion is brought before the House to become a resolution and I don’t say anything for or against the motion, I would feel bad knowing that I am supposed to speak up. I think that is where people might say: ‘oh! She would always contribute.’ It is not because it is exciting to me, but because it is my job and I have to do it well.You are one of the longest-serving lawmakers. How do you feel?I am grateful to my constituents because they believe in me. And if they still want me, I will continue to serve them. Moreover, I was not there because I am Funmi Tejuoso. I was elected there and my goal was to make a change and make an impact in the lives of others. Our leader, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, would say power is not served ala carte. You have to work for it, you have to earn it. So I try to earn what I believe is my right, I try to show to my colleagues that I am not just a woman here, but I am qualified to be here and can compete with the male folks.Are you satisfied with the level of women participation in politics?When I came in 2003, I was the only woman and we were 40 members. But the story has changed now and we have seven women and 33 men. I just pray we have more women in politics and we are getting there.What is the biggest challenge that you have faced as a lawmaker?For me, challenges are not issues, but the way I handle them is. I do believe everything that happens to me is the will of God. I feel there is nothing that has happened to a politician that has not happened to me, apart from going to jail and I pray I do not go to jail. I try to keep my hands clean at all times. But in life, there are intrigues and you cannot control intrigues or other people. When I first came in 2003, one member told me that the House was full of intrigues. With time, I know what he meant; it is a House of intrigues where some people feel if they don’t pull you down, they cannot achieve. I feel this is a bad way to live and eventually, they would be pulled down as well. We can see that those who tried to pull other people down have ended up down themselves. It is not me, but the will of God. When I have challenges, I would comport myself and ask God to handle the ones that are too much for me. And He has always handled them. For me, it is not the challenges, but how you handle them. Some people go through challenges and never recover, but once you are able to recover from yours, then God is faithful.Politics, some say, is a dirty game, what will you say you like and don’t like about politics?I like the fact that I am impacting on the lives of a greater number of people, particularly women and children. I touch them in different ways. I have contributed in making laws that impacted on the lives of children, women and my constituents. All these things become a thing of joy for you when you realise the number of people you have touched their lives positively. It makes me feel better. For example, the domestic violence law which I sponsored when I was the only female member in the House, it took me four years to get the bill passed into law. But today, I am happy that the law is having positive impact in the lives of women and children. I don’t like deceit. There is a lot of deceit in politics. I don’t believe in sycophancy or hypocrisy. I think that is another problem I have in politics. I don’t follow anybody. I give my leader utmost respect. I am loyal to my party. I am respectful but I don’t believe in following anybody. We all must contribute to make the House of Assembly a success but you don’t need to back bite anybody. You don’t need to bring anybody down. We need to work as a unit, as the broom of APC. It is difficult to break a broom when they are together. I believe in that. It’s difficult for me, like my children would say, to kiss an ass (laughter).What determines what you wear?I think it is my mood and not what is in vogue. I realise that sometimes, when I am angry, I dress better because I don’t want people to know I am angry. My mother used to tell us that, “Never let your enemy see you sweat.” So, I won’t be sad and because of that dress shabbily. My mother also used to tell us that your appearance is your letter of recommendation.How were you able to keep your shape after four children?First of all, I give myself peace of mind. I don’t see challenges as problems, I am not the type that when I go to bed, I start thinking what is going to happen. I make amends where I need to, I add value where I need to, I celebrate with people when I need to but at the end of the day, at night time, I cannot do anything to change whatever it is that has happened during the day. God has always been good to me. I also do exercise, I go to the gym, I go to the spa. I feel as you get older, you have to keep fit so you can do things. Children are fit because they don’t stay in one place, jump about, play football, play basketball. As we grow, we should stay fit. Some of us, as we get older, we are in the office and when a paper falls from our table, we would press the bell for someone else to come and pick it up because, actually, we should be exercising our self rather than sitting down and getting fatter and fatter. So it is better to do those little things: go to the table, get to the book shelve to get things that you need and when it gets difficult and one person cannot handle it, then you can call someone for help. Those are the kind of things I do and I don’t take the day’s pollution. I drink a lot of water. I am not the type that does cleansing of the face. I feel some of these things dry the skin. I think it’s better to use simple soap to wash your face. I eat healthy. I take plenty of vegetable, salad and very little rice. I eat candy but very little these days. Unlike before, I could eat candy for the whole day. But I realised that is not too healthy for me.
Nigerians are already out, indicating their readiness, to partner with the incoming government in re-inventing a Nigeria already thoroughly hobbled by a succession of some unthinking PDP governmentsNigerians must surely have gone through hell in the 16 years of PDP  rule – call it ruination – going by the reactions I have so far received  since last week’s publication of  ‘The Change Nigeria Needs’. They have come in torrents but space constraint will not allow us publish all.  Concerned with what Nigerians now know the PDP is capable of, a highly regarded, retired public servant, eager to see that Nigeria remains financially healthy, was kind enough to draw my attention to something he believes Nigerians must watch out for. This, according to him, is financial transactions between now and May 29. Not a few Nigerians have likened President Goodluck Jonathan to the Second Republic President Shehu Shagari who is highly regarded across board as a very decent statesman, but who, unfortunately, surrounded himself with all manner of characters, among them, those who should not be found in the public service of even Myanmar. Like Shagari, like Jonathan, they say, except that the former did not have the bad luck of being further weighed down by a totally misbegotten spouse who threw all caution to the wind and, with her verbal diarrhea, caused all manner of problems for the husband. Or what manner of a First Lady could have listlessly denigrated an integral part of northern culture for which the president built some special schools thereby costing him what may have run into hundreds of thousands of votes. The president is, of course, well aware of the kind of persons at his table having many times shielded some from appearing before the legislature to answer to allegations of corruption.That, therefore, must have informed what the retired public servant, in bullet form, itemised as follows under what he titled: NEED TO STOP UNLAWFUL MOVEMENT OF CASH AND ACCOUNTS WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY.1. The period between now and the end of May is critical and vulnerable. There is therefore, the need to put in place a machinery to monitor all financial transactions;2. Movement and transfer of funds, especially of unusual value, will have to be carefully watched;3. All financial transactions beyond Nigerian borders must equally be watched;4. Payments for existing contracts and the original terms of the contract agreements must be closely monitored;5. Banks’ Chief Executives must be warned not to be involved in unlawful transactions like emergency transfer of funds;6. Last minute contracts, involving advance payments, must be stopped and passed over to the incoming administration;7. All MDAs with ongoing financial liabilities must bring such to the notice of the Joint Transition Committee;8. The Central  Bank must be at its best in monitoring both internal or out offshore financial transactions;9. Necessary measures aimed at averting any untoward distortion of the monetary and financial situation of the country should quickly be put in place by the Joint Transition Committee.In anticipation of  a re-introduction of the War Against Indiscipline (WAI) first introduced by the president-elect at his first coming some three decades ago, Nigerians are already out, indicating their readiness, to partner with the incoming government in re-inventing a Nigeria already thoroughly hobbled by a succession of some unthinking PDP governments. Our next example, shared by the African Youth International Development Foundation, exemplifies this. It was sent to me shortly after Fikayo Tunde-Ojo had posted it on the Ekitipanupo web portal.Under the caption: IT’s TIME TO SAY, SHOUT OR SCREAM: CHANGE!It reads like a rhyme and I would enjoin Nigerians to internalise them and from henceforth, put it into everyday use even long before 29 May.When somebody in the car ahead of you throws wastes on the road, drive next to him, roll down your window and shout, “change!” ,#ChangeNigeria.When you are on a queue and someone tries to force his/her way in front of you, scream “change!!”. #ChangeNigeria.At the point of entry, either at an air or sea port, or at a border with our neighbours, a custom or immigration official shows up asking for bribe, shout Change. # Change Nigeria.If you see any irregularities in the measurement of food items in the market or display of fake products in a supermarket or drug store or spare parts shop: shout Change. #Change Nigeria.To any lecturer that is hell bent on collecting bribe, in cash or in kind:  harass him with Change. # Change Nigeria.To any public / private servant stealing from our national heritage. Shout Change. # Change Nigeria#When a police officer stops your car and says “Oga, anything for the boys?”, tell him, “change!”. #ChangeNigeriaWhen you walk past any Nigerian who throws paper or banana peel on the floor, stop him and tell him, “change!”. #ChangeNigeria.If the church opposite your house is using a loud speaker to disturb the neighbourhood, visit the pastor & say, “change sir!” #ChangeNigeriaIf you are in a bus and the driver is driving like mad, shout “change!” #ChangeNigeria.If the mosque opposite your house is using a loud speaker to disturb the neighbourhood, visit the Imam & say, “change sir!” #ChangeNigeria.When somebody is trying to jump a queue either at the bank, fuel station or at an  ATM stand: shout Change. #change Nigeria #When an electricity official cuts your light unjustly, trying to extract a bribe: shout Change. # Change Nigeria#.If you discover someone on phone lying about his location: shout change #If you discover a man or a woman cheating on the spouse: whisper CHANGE!When a fuel attendant wants to under dispense fuel into your vehicle remind him about “Change” #Change Nigeria#Finally, although I am not hereby authenticating the figures, Nigerians want President Buhari, working with the huge APC majority in the legislature, to maximally cut the cost of governance which is accentuated by the allowances being paid to federal legislators; which are indicated as follows:* Constituency Allowance (200% of B.S) – N4,968,509.00  * Newspapers Allowance (50% of B.S) – N1,242,122.70  * Wardrobe Allowance (25% of B.S) – N621,061.37  * Recess Allowance (10% of B.S) – N248,424.55  * Accommodation (200% of B.S) – N4,968,509.00  * Utilities (30% of B.S) – N828,081.83  * Domestic Staff (70% of B.S) – N1,863,184.1  * Entertainment (30% of B.S) – N828,081.83  * Personal Assistants (25% of B.S) – N621,061.12  * Vehicle Maintenance Allowance (75% of B.S) – N1,863,184.12   * Leave Allowance (10% of B.S) – N248,424.55  * Severance Gratuity (300% of B.S) – N7,452,736.50   * Car Allowance (400% of B.S) – N9,936,982.00Source: The Economist –but if the figures happen to be wrong, Senate President David Mark should please, immediately, furnish Nigerians with the correct figures.From the foregoing, it is easy to see that  while at a minimum N18, 000 per month (N216,000) the Nigerian earning the minimum wage  takes home an annual $1,333.00, his senator, who he never sees beyond the campaigns grosses $2,183,685 and the Nigerian university professor, even of medicine, earns no more than N6 million. It also means that it will take an average Nigerian worker 1,638 years to earn the annual salary of his Senator.Unfortunately with an eye on the 2015 elections, now gone with the wins, and the need to be in the good books of the politicians within the legislature, President Jonathan never one day talked about  reducing the ballooning cost of governance in the country. This was obviously one of the many ways he completely alienated Nigerians who roundly voted him out.
A day after crafting his finest round at Augusta National in four years, Tiger Woods went a step further Saturday as he continued to strengthen his comeback narrative at the Masters.Woods finished the third round tied for fifth overall after sinking six birdies en route to a four-under-par 68. The four-time Masters winner enters Sunday's final round at six-under overall.Woods finished one stroke ahead of his second-round total, posting two sub-70 scores at the Masters for the first time since 2005. Still, Woods wasn't totally pleased with his round.“I had my chances to make this a really special round today,” Woods said. “Man, I had it going there for a little bit. I made a stupidly good birdie at 13 and a stupidly bad bogey at 14. You know, it all evens out.”The round got off to a positive start for Woods after he birdied holes Nos. 2-4. He missed out on legitimate birdie chances on Nos. 6 and 7 after he missed a pair of relatively short putts.His biggest save of the day -- and possibly of his entire career at Augusta National -- came on 13 when Woods botched his tee shot with a "snap hook" that sent the ball flying into the rough. It could have been much worse, but the 14-time major winner put together a string of incredible shots that culminated in a spectacular 15-foot putt for birdie.Woods ended the day tied with Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Kevin Na and Kevin Streelman, 10 strokes behind leader Jordan Spieth. Justin Rose, Phil Mickelson and Charley Hoffman also were ahead of Woods.Woods knows it'll take a remarkable effort to beat Spieth on Sunday.“I'm going to have to post something low,” he said. “It's in Jordan's hands right now.”For the second straight day, Woods hits the middle of the first fairway with a 280-yard tee shot that lands safely to the left of a deep bunker. He follows up with a well-placed approach landing roughly 20 feet to the right of the cup. Woods misses a birdie putt that rolls slightly to the left before tapping in to save par. Tiger has birdied, bogeyed and made par on No. 1 this week.Woods makes another strong shot off the tee, hitting a 308-yard drive to set up a long approach shot. Woods' second shot falls just short of one of the two bunkers guarding the front of the green. The angle presents a favorable lie for birdie. Woods then hits a pitch shot six feet from the green before sinking in an easy birdie putt.Woods opens with a 316-yard drive that lands in the rough about 30 yards to the left of the hole. He follows with a spectacular approach that falls less than two feet from the pin. He birdies the hole. It has been an encouraging start for Woods.Woods appears to be on top of his game. His 226-yard tee shot falls 10 inches away from the pin. He then birdies the hole to earn his third birdie in four holes. There have been a couple of amazing shots by Woods over the last two holes. It'll be interesting to see if he can maintain this momentum the rest of the way -- if he does, Spieth could be in trouble.Woods finds the fairway again from 280 yards off the tee, avoiding the two bunkers to the left to set up a straight, 190-yard approach. Woods then finds the middle of the green, 26-feet from the pin -- a birdie will be tricky to achieve. Woods makes par after his birdie putt trails to the right. Woods is tied with Ernie Els and Charl Schwartzel.A chance to move another peg up the leaderboard dissolves when Woods misses a six-foot birdie putt. His tee shot lands just inches from the pin, but he's forced to settle for par after his first slip-up of the day.Woods finds the middle of the fairway with a 302-yard tee shot. Woods follows with yet another fine approach shot that leaves him 10 feet from the pin. The irons are also performing well for the 14-time major winner. He just misses the birdie putt as it rolls past the hole. Woods, once again, has to live with par.A conservative, 220-yard second shot keeps the ball on the fairway, making up for a flare that nearly landed in a bunker off the tee. A spectacular wedge approach lands him six feet from the cup. For the second straight day, he birdies on No. 8. Woods is tied for sixth with Rory McIlroy.Woods barely manages to avoid the left-side trees, hitting the ball into the rough about 110 yards away from the cup. Woods then overcompensates on the approach as the ball rolls off the backside of the green. His third shot sets up a challenging 10-footer for par, which he sinks. Woods goes four-under through the front nine.The driver has started to cool a little bit for Woods. He lands on the right side of the fairway on his tee shot, but it shouldn't pose much of a problem. A respectable 155-yarder puts him 21 feet from the flag. His birdie putt is accurate, but it runs out of steam inches from the cup. Par again.Woods hits the middle of the fairway with a big 332-yard drive to set himself for a good look to the pin. His second shot falls a bit short on the green, but it gives him a solid line for an otherwise tough 33-foot birdie try. The attempt breaks a little early and rolls wide. He taps in for par.Gusty conditions create problems as Woods sends the ball just to the left of the pin in front of one the three bunkers surrounding the green. He faces an uphill slope to the hole. His chip rolls about two feet short of the hole. Woods makes par.
Given the current rate of defections from the PDP to the APC, it will be a miracle if at the inauguration of the Muhammadu Buhari APC government on May 29 anyone of ‘timbre and calibre’ is left with President Jonathan. The defections began shortly before the presidential poll, with some politicians crossing over to the APC hours before the ballots were cast. Some of the defections, such as the ones that convulsed Ondo State and unnerved Governor Olusegun Mimiko, were so comprehensive and debilitating that they left the victims dazed and disconcerted.The defections have gone essentially in one direction, where they used to be multidirectional many months back. The only beneficiary now, of course, is the APC. This has left the PDP haemorrhaging very badly. In fact, some politicians now actively fear that if the defections go on at this frenetic pace, the country could transform into a one-party state, especially because there is no law regulating or barring defections. Politicians no one ever expected could defect have done so unashamedly and cavalierly.If anyone thought the defections were limited to specific geopolitical zones, he would be wrong. No zone is left out in the scramble. The defectors come from the North and South, East and West. They are young and old, rich and poor. What binds most of them together is their common opportunism.One reason for the gale is the well-known reluctance by Nigerian politicians to roost in the opposition, a camp described and derided as a punishing wilderness of lack and want and humiliation. Since their businesses depend on government patronage, staying in the opposition is sheer ostracism and death. The second reason is that both the APC and PDP are widely believed to lack ideological differentiation. Even if this is not wholly true, the defectors themselves do not think they are discomfited by ideology, nor do they attach any ideological coloration to the two main parties.There will, therefore, be more defections in the days ahead, some significant, some unremarkable. No one will stop them; and no one can stop them. Indeed, it will take a few more years for the peregrinations to end and the evolution of the parties to be completed. Meanwhile, roll out the drums and welcome into the new ruling party the pilgrim fathers and the prodigal sons.
The Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, has described the governorship and House of Assembly elections in the state as a sham. The governor disclosed this to reporters yesterday, immediately after his voting in Umuigwe Ward 2, Polling Unit 14, Ubima in Ikwerre Local Government Area, that after assessing the entire process he concluded that the election was fraught with crises, shootings, and killings.Governor Amaechi said that what happened in Rivers State therefore, could not be regarded as election, saying, ‘’all over the place, at least at Omagwa, I saw a corpse, I saw people attacking people, shooting people.‘’I had to stop at a polling unit to rescue people at Omagwa. The police and the army have completely broken down security. Did you see a policeman here or anywhere around? We relied on the army and police but PDP made arrangements for thugs and they are killing people. This election is a sham. The result is a sham,’’ he maintained.Asked why he cast his votes in yesterday’s exercise, the governor stated that he voted because he was shown the result sheets from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).He said: “At least, we have seen some result sheets. I hope that they have not stolen the collation sheet at INEC.”
Lagos socialite, Nancy Gabriel, is an actress and fashionista. She opted for the movie world because of the passion she has for the stage. In this interview with Adaeze Amos, she speaks about her lifestyle and what excites her as an actress.What did you study?I studied Banking and Finance at the Lagos State University, LASU.Having studied banking, why did you opt for acting?It’s because of the joy and fulfillment I derive from acting. Acting career to me is a job that looks like a hobby even when I’m at work. You are paid for enjoying yourself; that’s how I see it. After my graduation, I had to join the movie industry and till date I’m enjoying my job. Honestly, I’m doing so well in the acting world that I have starred in many movies. I have even lost count of the movies I have featured in.Of the movies you have starred, which is the most challenging?The most challenging is ‘Tears of the Getho’. The role I interpreted in that movie was really challenging because I fought and acted like a wayward person who had no control.Which role brought you into the limelight?It’s still the same ‘Tears of the Getho’. Then another one people gave me kudos for is ‘Revolution’. It got so popular that they knew me with that movie. For instance, I was walking to somewhere one day, some people were just reciting my lines off hand exactly the way I said it in that movie. I saw someone shouting the name I was called in the movie which was Omotola’s sister.Who would you love to be paired to interpret a romance role better?I don’t really have a particular actor in mind; I just act my thing and leave the set. As long as the person is a good actor, I’m at home to interpret any role you can think of including romance.Is there a role you won’t accept to interpret no matter the amount you’re offered?Yes! That would be porn movies of course. Movies that would have to do with nudity. To me, that would be the worst role any African woman will ever go for. Such movies do not befit Africa and her cultures. We should know we are Africans and not western people. We are under men’s domination, so we should respect that.What excites you most about your acting career?I love seeing myself on camera. That thrills me so much that I enjoy sitting back in my house and watch movies that I featured in. Another thing I enjoy about my acting job is the fact that I help people to see the realities of life through acting.Do you regret being a woman?Not at all! I would love to come as a woman over and over again. Nobody would want to miss the good opportunities that are attached to womanhood. So, I would rather come as a woman in my next life if there is anything like that.What was your first experience on a movie set like?My first experience was awesome. I starred in a movie with Paul Obazele, Eucharia Anunobi and the late Muna Obiekwe. To be candid, it was really cool working with them. I had a lot of fun with them on set.Tell us some movies you have starred in so far.‘Angels’, ‘Tears of Getho’, ‘Revelation’, ‘Life is beautiful’ and a whole lot that are about to be released.Who are those in Nollywood that lured you into the movie world?They are Genevieve Nnaji, Omotola, Olu Jacob, Pete Edochie and Joke Silva. These are Nollywood stars I admire.Are you saying you want to be like them?Not. In as much as I admire them because they are good in the job but I still wouldn’t want to be like any of them. I want to be myself; I’m aspiring to be the better version of me. Maybe, because I have my own unique style of doing things.What did you do to wriggle out of the pains of heartbreak?I have never been heartbroken in my life. I pray never to experience it because I wouldn’t even know how to come out of it.What are the qualities of your ideal man?I love clean, hard-working, caring and romantic men. I wouldn’t mind a man that can stop the time for me if that is possible. I love men that have a lot of collections in their wardrobes.What lesson has life taught you?Life has taught me never to judge a book by its cover and never to look down on people.What puts you off people?Besides acting, what else do you do for a living?I’m into business as well.How do you think life would  look like without fashion?Life would have been damn boring without fashion. Fashion is about colours, glamour and beauty. So, when you remove all these from life, it would be bleak.What part of your body do you love flaunting?Can you define your style?Yes I do. I wouldn’t want to appear old-fashioned. I wear things that are hot in the fashion world, styles that are fad of the moment.What fashion item forms a larger part of your wardrobe?I have a lot of good gowns, short things, leggings, sexy tops and jeans. I love and wear all styles as far as my colours are blended.
If you ever feel like so much of what’s happening on university campuses today is a bunch of nonsense, you’re not alone and you’re not the first.His book The Closing of the American Mind argued that the university system was overcome by moral relativism. They weren’t teaching long-valued wisdom anymore, but subjective trends.They were all about promoting “the political passion of the hour,” as columnist George Will described it in a review at the time. Knee-jerk activism was taking hold.The book was an unexpected bestseller. One of those works that finally said publicly and loudly what so many people had been thinking to themselves for years. “It may be politically portentous,” Will wrote of its popularity, suggesting change was on the horizon.Did that change occur? Nope. At least not according to acclaimed philosopher Roger Scruton in an essay “The End of the University” released earlier this month.He laments that “Books are put on or struck off the syllabus on grounds of their political correctness; speech codes and counseling services police the language and thought of both students and teachers; courses are designed to impart ideological conformity, and students are often penalized for having drawn some heretical conclusion about the leading issues of the day.”Like how the vaguely defined “rape culture” that’s so trendy with impressionable minds right now has brought us to the point where Rolling Stone is publishing activist features about a rape that just didn’t happen.Or how students at the University of Ottawa forced the shut down of an Ann Coulter event because they couldn’t handle the thought of someone with ideas different from their own finding an audience.So non-intellectual. So, to Bloom’s point, closed minded. Don’t like Ann? Don’t show up. That simple.As Scruton notes: “Moral relativism clears the ground for a new kind of absolutism. The emerging curriculum in the humanities is in fact far more censorious, in crucial matters, than the one that it strives to replace.”But this isn’t just about the handful of protests the student clubs get up to. The problem has leaked into all of the humanities – the once sacred home for all forms of inquiry.It’s about dismantling anything connected to the past, anything that suggests we can learn from the people who came before us: “The Marxist theory of ideology, or some feminist, poststructuralist, or Foucauldian descendent of it, will be summoned in proof of the view that the precious achievements of our culture owe their status to the power that speaks through them, and that they are therefore of no intrinsic worth.”In other words, too many of the departments are screwed. What do we do now?The change George Will predicted coming almost 30 years ago never did because while he was right to note that the silent majority clearly agreed that education was going down the tubes, they weren’t the folks running the academy. All you need is enough relativists to become heads of departments and that sets the trend.Scruton concludes “we can no longer entrust our high culture to the universities.” Who or what can we trust them to then? He points to the “private reading groups, online courses, associations of scholars, think tanks, and public-lecture series.”In other words, knowledge has gone open source. Screw sending your kids to university or college to get a broad education. Take it to the streets. Do it on the side.Interesting. But scary. Because it means any inquiry not approved by the politically correct has to go underground.Plus, any problems in the university are community problems. Both the taxpayer and those shelling out for tuition are paying for this.The closing of the post-secondary mind is a problem for all of us. The solution? Simple but hard to come by: Drop the relativism and P.C. shenanigans. Demand excellence in education.
The move, to be announced today, would see the allowance raised to £500,000 per person where a property is involved.It will mean only the wealthiest in the country would have to pay the 40% levy.The change will be funded by restricting pension tax relief for those earning more than £150,000 a year – 1% of the population.David Cameron, who yesterday visited a community hospital in his Witney, Oxfordshire, constituency, will say today: “That wish to pass something on is about the most basic, human and natural instinct there is.“That’s why for a long, long time I have wanted to act on inheritance.“We will take the family home out of inheritance tax.“"That home that you have worked and saved for belongs to you and your family."You should be able to pass it on to your children.
Southam Town Council in Warwickshire is the first in Britain to shun appeals to honour the Afghanistan war dead.Family and friends of Pete Jeff “JJ” Doherty – killed in an ambush in 2008 – blasted the decision as locals called for a change of heart.JJ’s mum Joyce, 41, said: “I think it’s awful how they’ve treated us.“This road name isn’t about the council and it isn’t about me.“This is about nothing more than the fact my son went to war and never came home.”The Daily Star Sunday’s Hometown Heroes campaign is calling for town halls to honour fallen soldiers.
A majority of Scots support having a benefit cap of £26,000 per household, according to a poll.The YouGov research for the Scottish Conservatives found that 65% of people back the current cap, which is set at the national average income, compared to 15% who oppose it.More than half (54%) of those surveyed agreed with Conservative plans to lower the cap to £23,000 after the general election, while 26% were opposed.However, almost a third (30%) agreed with the statement that benefits for unemployed people "are too low and cause undue hardship".That compares to 36% who thought that benefits were too high and discouraged people from finding work.The Scottish Conservatives said the findings vindicated their party's plans for welfare reform.Welfare reform spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said: "This important poll confirms that despite Labour and SNP scaremongering, the majority of Scots are wholeheartedly on the side of the UK Government's bid to get Scotland back to work."And it shows that Ed Miliband and Nicola Sturgeon speak for the minority in failing to reform welfare, and racking up our nation's debts."Indeed on the benefit cap, Nicola Sturgeon and Ed Miliband don't just speak for the minority, they speak for the minority of their own supporters."The current UK Government has done what previous Labour administrations failed to do. We saw how our broken welfare system was trapping people in dependency, and we did something about it."The result is thousands more people going out to work, not waiting for a dole cheque."
The luxury hotel has been told to clean up its act by the Food Standards Agency. Inspectors gave the establishment – where suites can cost more than £10,000 a night – only two out of five stars in their latest check.Westminster Council issued an “improvement required” rating, meaning it “has not achieved an acceptable level of compliance with the requirements of food hygiene law”.But the Savoy Tandoori in great Yarmoth in norfolk earned five stars. The popular seaside curry house was awarded a food rating of “very good” by Great Yarmouth Council.
BRITISH drivers are being hounded over alleged motoring offences in Europe with the help of the DVLA.It hands over the details of more than 4,000 registered car owners every month so European councils can chase Brits for alleged parking and toll road fines. In the last year it has passed information on 48,460 drivers to European authorities and pocketed £2.50 for each one – a total of around £121,000. The DVLA gives details to a Britishbased company called Euro Parking Collections (EPC) which acts for around 100 EU-based authorities. In the last financial year the number of requests made by EPC for the details of the registered keeper of UK cars has surged almost 25%.“The scale of this trade in personal information should be of deep concern to every motorist in the country” With parking fines of around £30 each it means UK motorists are being hounded for around £1.5million of motoring penalties every year because of the tie-up. The difference in approach is sure to enrage British drivers who feel they are being chased with more vigour than foreigners who commit motoring offences in the UK. Emma Carr, director of civil liberties group Big Brother Watch, said: “The scale of this trade in personal information should be of deep concern to every motorist in the country.” A DVLA spokesman said: “We do not release driver and keeper information to non-UK authorities to deal with parking enquiries or speeding penalties. “However, Euro Parking Collections does request keeper details to pursue cases of parking contraventions on behalf of public sector authorities in EU member states.”The DVLA says that despite charging for information it hands over it does not profit from the trade. An EPC spokesman said: “Foreigners in the UK are not getting away with similar traffic contraventions that are being committed in the UK as EPC represents a number of UK authorities. “We perform the same service in terms of identifying the owners of foreign vehicles that have incurred a traffic contravention by contacting the foreign DVLA equivalent and recovering any outstanding traffic contraventions in those countries. “British drivers are not being treated differently to foreign drivers for civil contraventions.” EPC does not act for local authorities in France, Germany or most of Spain and Italy because councils there are not responsible for motoring offences, which are dealt with by the police. Last year it was disclosed that drivers of cars with foreign number plates escaped paying an estimated £4million worth of speeding fines on our roads over 12 months.
Protection: The prison governor says condoms are issued for safety reasonsPrisoners at a jail housing dozens of transgender inmates are being given taxpayer-funded condoms.Guards at HMP Isle of Wight were told all sex is banned between its 1,000 male lags – who include about 35 living as women.Yet medics there are said to have provided hundreds of contraceptives to stop the spread of sexually transmitted disease.A source said staff were told by governor Andy Lattimore at a meeting that the condoms were "issued for safety reasons" while adding: "We do not condone this activity."The insider added: “It’s strange. No one is meant to be having sex inside the prison but it seems it will happen whether there is a ban or not.“You have men who are living as women, dressing as women, who are taking part in sex acts with other men.“So we have a situation where inmates are being given condoms even though they are taking part in an activity which is banned.“It has been decided this is the most sensible course of action.”Prison rules state anyone caught taking part in sexual activity at the jail faces a loss of privileges including in-cell TVs and recreation time.Despite this warning a report in a medical journal said leaflets and posters have been distributed by nurses at the prison bearing the slogan: “When things get hard...use a condom.”Some inmates who have been caught having sex are understood to have been moved to other jails.Many of the cons are convicted sex offenders.A Home Office study in the 1990s found as many as one in 30 adult male prisoners have sex with another man while behind bars, and at the time of the study, few used condoms.In 1999 a gay inmate went to court to win the right for men to be allowed condoms in prison.And in 2012, another gay prisoner won a High Court victory after claiming he was being “effectively denied” access to condoms at maximum security HMP Whitemoor jail in March, Cambs.Reform groups including the Howard League have recommended greater access to contraceptives for safety reasons.Dress code: HMP Albany Prison, one of two on the Isle of WightIn February the Sunday People revealed cons at HMP Isle of Wight are allowed to live as women - but under a strict dress code.Some 35 have been given the green light to wear dresses, bras and knickers.But underwired bras are banned, and heels must be no higher than an inch.We also uncovered a report by jail inspectors which recommended a mobile hairdresser be brought in to HMP Isle of Wight to look after the cross dressers.A Prison Service spokesman said: “We do not condone sex in prisons and offenders in a relationship are not allowed to share a cell.“As is the case in all prisons, offenders can request condoms from healthcare staff who must make them available to any prisoner who requests them if, in their clinical judgement, there is a risk of the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.”
He said: “When I got it for Christmas I was over the moon.”It has lights, indicators, a petrol gauge and a top speed of 75mph. Retired fairground boss Tom Evans, 69, was given the nifty motor by his wife and kids.The purple funfair motor is a fully-converted dodgem that runs on petrol.Tom couldn’t wait to get the bonkers contraption on the road but it needed a lot of work to get it running.The dodgem was fitted with £700 worth of gear, including new lights and a brake.But the car’s odd appearance has got him into trouble with the police. He was pulled over with his son while driving it for the first time.He said: “They wanted to know what the hell it was and we had to explain and take the documents down to the station."They all came out to have a look – they were flabbergasted.”Now Tom, from Glasgow, carries his paperwork whenever he takes the car out to prove to officers the vehicle is roadworthy.He is now using it to help raise money for a charity that helps the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
A car has flipped and burst into flames during a police chase on the Gold Coast, leaving a passenger with a broken neck.Officers were on the lookout for hoons at Yatala, south of Brisbane, on Saturday night, when they saw a car doing burnouts and tried to pull it over.They say the Holden Commodore mounted a kerb to evade them and later swerved around an officer who was standing on the road ordering the driver to stop.The police helicopter Polair continued to monitor the car, which allegedly ran a red light and almost struck another vehicle before hitting a pole, flipping onto its roof and catching alight.A 19-year-old male passenger was taken to hospital with a broken neck, along with the male driver, 20, and a 17-year-old female passenger who suffered shock and bruising.

Mr and Mrs Murray after their wedding ceremony at Dunblane CathedralThousands lined the streets as tennis ace Andy Murray married his long-term girlfriend Kim Sears in a private ceremony before around 300 family and close friends.After braving rain, wind and even hail as they waited patiently for hours, the crowds were rewarded with a gleeful public appearance from the clearly ecstatic newlyweds.As they emerged from the Cathedral under a shower of confetti, more than 3,000 people cheered and clapped as though their hero had claimed another Wimbledon title.The new Mr and Mrs Murray, both 27, grinned and waved happily to the adoring throng - and even exchanged a few words with the Scottish Sunday Express.After being congratulated and asked how the wedding had gone, Andy replied: "It was great, thanks."His bride, wearing a simple but elegant white gown of silk chiffon, was simply radiant with delight before they were driven away in a silver Bentley to the reception at Andy's luxurious Cromlix hotel.The dress, with half-sleeves, a full skirt and open back, was a Jenny Packham design and adorned by hand beaded Swarovski crystals and came with a three-metre tulle veil and Swarovski crystal Kalmia floral headdress. The bride also wore a pair of silvery strappy sandals.Earlier, the big day had dawned with wintry showers sweeping across the Perthshire hills following a week of glorious sunny weather.With more than a dash of irony, Andy's mother Judy tweeted: "Hailstones. Marvellous" before adding a few hours later: "Snowing. White wedding."However the sun was shining by the time the groom, dressed in a traditional Murray tartan kilt, was piped onto the grounds shortly after 3.30pm.Half an hour later, the heavens opened as the bridal car drove through Dunblane - to be greeted by an impromptu Mexican wave along the High Street and even people hanging out of upper windows for a glimpse of the bride.Kim - who was around five minutes late - stepped out into the rain flanked by the Cathedral’s blue-cloaked choir and escorted by her bridesmaids in dusky pink gowns, before hurrying indoors.Andy had three best men - brother Jamie and friends and fellow tennis players Ross Hutchins and Carlos Mier.Hutchins, 30, who has battled cancer, was one of the first to arrive, giving a thumbs-up as he entered the 300-seat Cathedral.Judy Murray, dressed in a smart white outfit, arrived separately from Andy's father, William, who was with his partner Sam Watson.Also present were Tim and Lucy Henman, Andy's grandmother Shirley Erskine and his glamorous new mother-in-law Leonore Sears.
Britain's tennis superstar Andy Murray got his knees out in style to marry Kim Sears in a lavish ceremony.Thousands of well wishers braved hail and snow to cheer the happy couple after they tied the knot in the 12th century Dunblane ­cathedral in front of 300 people.Andy looked dashing in a tartan kilt and sporran and Kim was ­stunning in an embroidered gown with three quarter length sleeves and lace veil.The overjoyed couple, who are both 27, posed for pictures and waved to the crowds before ­being whisked off to a reception at nearby hotel Cromlix House, owned by Murray, in a silver Rolls-Royce Phantom.Former Wimbledon champ Andy’s brother Jamie, 29, was best man and ex-British number one Tim Henman attended with his wife Lucy Heald.Andy and his groomsmen wore matching kilts of blue, green and yellow tartan, along with a jacket cut in a traditional Scots style. The check and colours in the ace’s kilt appeared to be that worn by the Murray of Elibank clan.His outfit was complete with a sporran and a boutonnière of thistles and cream roses.Kim dazzled in an embellished white gown with three-quarter length sleeves rumoured to be by Jenny Packham, the designer favoured by Hollywood A-listers.She walked the aisle in a pair of strappy shoes believed to be by Jimmy Choo and wore her brunette hair pinned back with a veil.But the day was tinged with sadness as it emerged photographer Gordon Jack, 47, who fell during Friday’s rehearsal died in hospital yesterday.Gordon was taken to Forth Valley Hospital in Larbert, 14 miles away, and put in a ­medically induced coma but died from complications after a heart attack.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry (2nd L), U.S. Under Secretary for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman (2nd R) and staff watch a tablet in Lausanne as U.S. President Barack Obama makes a state address on the status of the Iran nuclear program talks, April 2, 2015.Iran and world powers are engaged in talks to reach a comprehensive deal that would place limits on Iran's nuclear programme in return for the removal of some U.S., European, and United Nations sanctions on its financial and energy sectors.The United States has said that sanctions removal on Iran will be phased gradually, but Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, have said that sanctions on Iran must be lifted as soon as a final agreement is concluded."Solutions have been obtained and it seems that the principles and red lines of the Islamic Republic in technical issues have been accepted by the enemy," said Mohammad Ali Jafari, the commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), according to Fars News."However in regards to removing the sanctions, there are ambiguities which need to be made clear and we must realise that this very issue of how the sanctions will be removed can lead to a lack of agreement."The IRGC, an elite military force, plays a major role in Iran's political and economic affairs.
Several hundred of Ireland's 5,000 doctors are gay but may not be "out" in the workplace and are too afraid to speak publicly about the upcoming marriage equality referendum, Health Minister Leo Varadkar said yesterday.The minister was speaking as he addressed the annual meeting of the Irish Medical Organisation in Kilkenny and used the opportunity to urge medics to turn out and vote 'Yes' in favour of same-sex marriage on May 22.Mr Varadkar, who publicly declared he is gay earlier this year, said: "I want to mention one non-medical matter, the referendum on marriage equality on May 22. There are about 5,000 doctors in Ireland and by the law of averages several hundred must be gay, lesbian or bisexual."He said many gay doctors are not "out" in their workplace, and that while medicine is not a discriminatory profession, in the back of their mind is the concern that they may be treated differently by colleagues or patients. And he said that, for reasons of professionalism, they are unlikely to raise the referendum in the workplace."But don't think for a second that means that the referendum result is not important to them. It is. It is not just about equality. It is also a statement of acceptance by their peers. By you. A 'No' will make things much harder for the same reasons," Mr Varadkar said."In my opinion, marriage is an institution that has stood the test of time precisely because it has adapted to the times - the abolition of divorce in the 1920s and its reintroduction as the right to remarry 70 years later, judicial separation, the Succession Act, the Marital Home Act, the end of the marriage bar, and the abolition of conjugal rights as a defence against marital rape all changed the legal definition of marriage - but they did not weaken it."He added: "Marriage can only be strengthened by extending it to loving, committed couples of the same sex."I know that there are some among us here today who will vote 'No' out of conscience or religious conviction, I respect that. However, I am convinced that the vast majority of us here support the change. In a democracy, decisions are made by those who turn up. The turnout in referendums rarely exceeds 50pc. Please turn up on Friday, May 22 and vote 'Yes' for equality."The Minister earlier received a standing ovation from doctors, despite telling medics at the conference that he would not work for some of the fees they are getting.When he was told that many GPs have given up stitching patients - because they only get €7 for the service - the minister admitted he would not personally do the job for that sum.However, he said the plan to sign up for the controversial contract offering free GP visits to under-sixes - worth €67m to GPs - is just a first step in more investment in GP care, and the austerity cuts of over €100m imposed on their State fees will be restored in the coming years.Varadkar had spent much of the day mingling with doctors in a bid to appeal to GPs to sign up for the plan.Most of a gathering of around 150 of the 2,500 at the meeting expressed strong reservations about the move, but conceded they are likely to be left with little choice but to sign up. It will mean that around 270,000 under-sixes whose parents currently pay around €60 for a GP visit will visit their doctor for free from early to mid-July.Dr Niall MacNamara, a GP in Waterford, told the minister that general practice is haemorrhaging and the extra funding for the under-sixes will just "slow the blood loss".He said bluntly: "We need to get general practice out of intensive care."Mayo GP Dr Oliver White said the decision to end the scheme where GPs were allowed to keep some of the savings they made in drug dispensing was a major financial blow and affected jobs.Under the proposed under-sixes scheme, GPs who sign up will get a €125 a year capitation fee per child, regardless of the number of visits. They have to do a weight and height check at age two and five years. They will get extra payments for diagnosing asthma and providing checks.The doctors are also in line for a €100 annual fee for providing two reviews of adult diabetics who are covered by the medical card and GP visit scheme. However, doctors are worried they will not be able to cope with the extra workload.Varadkar told the conference: "I know a lot of GPs are disgruntled after years of cutbacks... but you are doing the right thing for general practice and for patients, and history will remember you for it. This is, after all, the widest extension in eligibility in health care service since Erskine Childers brought in the first GMS contract almost half a century ago and wider than the Mother and Child Scheme before that."But this is just phase one. I look forward to the commencement of talks soon on the new GP contract."The minister said this will allow for expansion of GP care without fees, including for other children.
The organiser of an unruly party where 11 people were arrested by police who used anti-riot equipment says it only got out of hand once authorities intervened.Up to 300 partygoers filled an unoccupied flat and a neighbouring empty section on Cranford St in St Albans on Saturday night after 18-year-old Brook Johnson organised the private event on Facebook.The University of Otago student was home in Christchurch for his mid-semester break, and held the party in the family-owned property before he headed back south on Sunday.Inspector Rick Jury said police received multiple complaints about the party, including public urination, smashed bottles and screams.After police arrived about 11.30pm fireworks were reportedly set off in their direction, Jury said.A video of the incident circulating on social media showed young men running over top of a taxi as it attempted to leave the area.A line of police officers with shields and helmets, uniformed cops and a police dog and handler attempted to move about 100 young people gathered on Cranford St towards Westminster St.Jury said 11 people were arrested for various disorder offences.Neighbours say the mayhem kept their children awake and the partygoers had "no respect" for police.Johnson and his friends spent Sunday cleaning the soon-to-be-demolished property, which was left damaged and strewn with bottles, cans and rubbish.He said he created a private Facebook event and expected about 150 people. He said he knew 80 per cent of the people there, with the majority of others he did not know invited by friends.Johnson said the party was under control, but shut it down after police arrived outside the property, forcing hundreds of drunken partygoers out on to the street."Personally, I don't think it (the party) got out of hand . . . it stayed pretty controlled inside the party, but the police obviously decided we were having too much fun and thought they would come and cut it."Everyone was in the positive zone, everyone was having a mean night, and the thing is I think the police actually made everyone angry, which caused people to do some dumb s***."It probably got more got out of hand when the police took everyone down the street. While everyone was in here, everything was safe, there was minimal people on the street - everyone was having a good night. I think it could have gone to three in the morning and it would have been mean, but it is what it is."Police had not made contact following the party and neighbours spoken to were OK with the party, he said, although he was yet to inform relatives who own the property.Neighbours told Stuff Johnson had notified them of the party beforehand, but they did not expect the drama that unfolded.Cranford St resident Dillyn Rule, 26, believed even if police did not intervene, the party was always going to end badly.He was shocked by the the partygoers' attitude towards police."Those young ones out there had no respect, no fear. They weren't scared of the police, they were throwing bottles and trying to attack them."Neighbour Sarah Jones, who has three children aged 3, 5 and 7, said the party and action on the street kept one of her children awake.
Local government has an important role in helping communities recover from disasters and the sector is building expertise in dealing with the aftermath of fire, flood and other extreme weather.Daniel Long, manager operations at Blue Mountains City Council, says reviewing what is learnt in preparation for the future is important. He was appointed recovery manager after the October 2013 bushfires that destroyed 197 houses, damaged many more and burnt huge tracts of national park and other land.Long grew up in Bristol, England, and studied rural science at the University of Plymouth before meeting his future wife, who came from the Blue Mountains region. He worked in the parks section at Hornsby council before taking on a series of asset maintenance, support and programming roles at Blue Mountains.Being adaptable and understanding community aspirations are important in many local government roles, Long says, and both are vital in the aftermath of traumatic events.During and immediately after the fires he had an operational role, organising road closures, traffic control, bringing in water and organising contractors to clear damaged vegetation.In the months after, he became involved in longer-term plans for recovery and, once state funding was received, became leader of a dedicated recovery team that is still working with the community."Getting a communication flow going was important. People needed to know that at any time they could give us a call and have a chat, or we could come out and see what we could do for them. There was a Mayoral Relief Fund and a range of other financial and psycho-social support. A lot of our work was about co-ordinating the response so people could go to one location to deal with a range of issues."The council worked closely with emergency services and state agencies during the fire, and with state and community agencies afterwards. A community reference group was established, a website set up and a recovery action plan developed. People who had worked in Victoria following the disastrous Black Saturday fires of February 2009 were consulted.Long says it is important to adopt a broad view of who might suffer trauma as a result of disaster to ensure it includes people who sustain physical harm and material damage and also those who are adversely affected by being in an area where an emergency plays out."We had children locked down in schools and they were going through a form of trauma, too," he says.Learnings from the period included the importance of working with the media to encourage visitors to return to safe tourist areas and minimise further economic damage, and recognition that conflicts and expectations need to be managed long after an event."Bushfires often leave underinsured residents with long-term financial problems and there can be community disagreement about how trees and other vegetation should be managed in future," Long says."We continue to learn from what works well and what doesn't."
Hillary Clinton would make a fine US president, Barack Obama told reporters Saturday, on the eve of the expected launch of her candidacy for the Democratic Party’s nod in 2016.Obama beat Clinton — who is vying to become the first woman president of the United States — for their party’s nomination in 2008 after a grueling campaign. He then won re-election four years later.“She was a formidable candidate in 2008. She was a great supporter of mine in the general election. She was an outstanding secretary of state. She is my friend,” Obama said at a regional summit in Panama.“I think she would be an excellent president.”Several US media reports, citing sources in Clinton’s campaign team, said the 67-year-old was likely to announce her candidacy for the Democratic nomination on Sunday.The former first lady is expected to be the clear Democratic frontrunner in the race to succeed Obama.The wife of former president Bill Clinton leads opinion polls among Democrats, some 60 percent of whom say they would vote for her in the primaries, according to the website RealClearPolitics.Two other potential candidates — Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vice President Joe Biden — have not yet said they intend to run.On the Republican side, Senators Rand Paul and Ted Cruz have already thrown their hats into the ring, with more candidates likely to follow — including Jeb Bush, former governor of Florida, brother to president George W. Bush and son of president George H.W. Bush.A series of polls this year have consistently placed Clinton ahead of every one of her potential Republican challengers, although the gap has narrowed in recent weeks.A bid to appear humble may have helped dispel doubts about Clinton raised in recent weeks, after it was revealed that she used a private email account for her work when she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013.Detailed examinations of donations from foreign states and businesses to the Clinton Foundation when she was secretary of state have also raised questions about potential conflicts of interest.
Finance Minister Mathias Cormann is optimistic that a deal can be reached over how GST revenue is carved up to help Western Australia through a damaging slump in the iron ore price.But the WA senator says the state government has got show it is willing to undertake reforms to boost its economy.State and territory treasurers rejected an idea to freeze the GST distribution at 2014/15 levels to prevent WA's share slump to less than 30 cents for every dollar spent in 2015/16.But Senator Cormann would like to think that on reflection the country's leaders will strike a deal when the Council of Australian Governments meets this week."We haven't reached the end of the process yet," Senator Cormann told Sky News on Sunday.He said by freezing GST relativities, each state would still be better off with an increase of five to six per cent in revenue compared to this financial year.But he said WA has to show a willingness to reform, such as undertaking privatisation, and he rejected WA Premier Colin Barnett's view that these issues aren't linked."There is no doubt in my mind that the West Australian government has to do better in the pursuit of economic reform," he said."The fact that they don't seem to have more of a sense of urgency around that, in my mind, weakens their argument in relation to GST distribution."Labor front bencher Mark Butler said there was an important principle of the Commonwealth that the nation's wealth, as far as possible, be distributed equally."While some of the mining states may suffer a bit of a boom and bust in terms of their revenue, the idea of sticking to that principle at the heart of the nature of the Commonwealth is a very important one," he told Sky News.
The Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate in Akwa Ibom State, Mr. Udom Emmanuel, refused to grant newsmen interview on Saturday after his accreditation at Awa-Iman Ward 1, Unit 2 at Onna Local Government Area.Asked to comment on the electoral process, he said he would not talk to the press since The Punch correspondents were around.“I cannot talk because PUNCH hates PDP,” he said.Having said that, he quickly walked away in the midst over 100 security operatives that accompanied him to his polling unit.In Onna LGA, confused voters were seen roaming about without getting accreditation as electoral materials had been hijacked by thugs suspected to be the PDP governorship candidate’s supporters.Our correspondents also saw some snatched electoral materials being taken away in Akwa Ibom Transport Company buses labelled UDOM EMMANUEL.The materials, it was learnt, were taken to the house of a top local government officer in Onna.Voters alleged that ballot papers were being thumb printed in the council boss’ home.Security operatives also barricaded all the streets leading to Onna LGA’s top shot’s home.Copyright PUNCH.

Islamic State has posted a video online that shows its militants destroying the ancient city of Nimrud in Iraq.The images appear to confirm reports in March that the jihadists had vandalised Nimrud, one of Iraq's greatest archaeological treasures.The video shows them using bulldozers and then explosives on the ruins of the ancient city.IS has attacked Nimrud and other ancient sites in Iraq as part of what it sees as a war against "false idols".In March, the Iraqi ministry of tourism said IS was heavy machinery to destroy the Assyrian ruins.Nimrud, which was founded in the 13th Century BC, lies about 30km (18 miles) south-east of Mosul.IS has controlled Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, and nearby areas since June 2014.The video showed militants using power tools to cut up and destroy stone artefacts at the site. After that, they place large amounts of explosions which are detonated in a huge blast, which appears to have levelled the site.Many treasures from Nimrud are in foreign museums, but a number of giant "lamassu" statues, depicting winged beasts with human heads, and stones friezes were still at Nimrud.The region held by the militants in Iraq has nearly 1,800 of the country's 12,000 registered archaeological sites.The reported destruction of the statues followed reports that IS burnt down Mosul Library, which housed over 8,000 ancient manuscripts.

The One & Only in Cape Town (only one of two in Africa, the other in Mauritius) is an example of the high standards set by the brand and has established a stellar reputation. One of many awards of note is Best Hotel in Africa 2014 by Conde Naste Traveller Readers Choice Awards.Set amidst the vibrant playground of one of the world’s most beautiful cities, the O&O Cape Town is at the famed V&A Waterfront and has captivating views of the Table Bay Harbour and the iconic Table Mountain.Less than 30 minutes from the Cape Town international airport, the O&O has 91 rooms in the seven-storey main building called the Marina Rise. All rooms get either the harbour view or the Table Mountain view.Then there are the two private islands connected to the main building by a bridge.  Across the bridge are 40 island rooms and suites as well as an award-winning spa. The private islands confirm the O&O as a resort of repute, each apartment secluded within scenic, lushly-landscaped surroundings.Service is a key component of any hospitality outfit and the first thing that struck me about the O&O was a real desire to please the customer. I was part of a team of five that arrived at the hotel before check-in time. While the rooms were being prepared, we were offered refreshments – tea, coffee and cocktails (virgin or dirty, your choice) – which you’d consider normal fare for a five-star resort.However, due to my work, I’m very dependent on the internet. Without checking-in, it wouldn’t be possible to log into the hotel’s complimentary wifi with my room code just yet. But the lady at the reception did not hesitate one bit in handing me a free 500MB voucher, even though my room would be ready in about 30 minutes anyway. Little gesture maybe, but it meant a lot to me.Another telling touch was the welcome letter in the room. It is standard practice for hotels to welcome guests with neat typewritten letters assuring the guest of how important he (or she) is, the facilities available and more. The idea is to make the guest feel special.This worked especially well at the O&O because the letter signed by marketing executive Ashleigh Fleming was handwritten. I scratched my head trying to remember the last time I got a handwritten note. Little gesture again but it sure made me feel special.The room itself was spacious and had all the facilities and modern gadgets you would expect of a resort of this calibre. Nespresso machine? Check. Ice machine? Check. DVD Player? Check. Ipod docking station? Sure. In-room business amenities too, with a fax connection.There was also a scent menu at my bedside table, the first time I’ve encountered anything like that. So the drill is, you choose from a list of options what you would want your room to smell like and housekeeping obliges. Awesome.Two things caught my attention immediately I got into the room.  The bowl of fruits which had bananas, grapes and apples, as well as a complimentary bottle of wine with two glasses on the centre table.The second was the jaw-dropping view from the balcony. The seductive blue waters of the harbour was so close, I felt I could dive in. The Two Oceans Aquarium is also visible from the balcony and is just a few paces away from the resort.There were different forms of watercraft on the harbour; anchored yachts, man-powered kayaks and everything in between. On the balcony were two chairs and a small table, ideal for sitting back and taking in the view. Best enjoyed with a friend I dare say. The view is so stunning, it needs to be shared.More than half the group I travelled with thought the view from their room was the best. I certainly believe mine was.Destination Weddings It won’t be surprising if you suddenly start feeling romantic at the O&O. The view is beautiful and friendly doves – always part of the scene – add to the tranquil feel. Love in the air, you might say.The O&O has taken full advantage of the ambience to design special wedding packages for clients. There are different options. One in particular caught my eye: the once-in-a lifetime opportunity to tie the knot out at sea. This involves a cruise along the Atlantic Coast with dolphins while enjoying the culinary delights of O&O’s acclaimed chefs; accompanied with the finest champagne. Not a bad way to say your vows.  Award-winning Spa, Heated Pool Among many awards won by the O&O Cape Town Spa is that of Best Spa in Africa 2011, 2012, 2013 at the World Spa Awards. That alone is a story in itself. The spa is set in an oasis of serenity on its own island within the resort. The spa features 10 treatment rooms, his-and-hers thermal suites, two vitality pools with air massage recliners, sauna and aroma-steam rooms, ice fountains and ‘experience’ showers with three different water settings.Truth is the spa experience at the O&O is better felt than described. The basic tenet here as my masseuse assured me after my hour-long therapy, is “the customer comes first.”I skipped using the vitality pool at the spa after my spa session. My co-travellers thought I missed out. Well, I opted for the heated infinity-edge pool which is not too far from the spa and know they missed an experience.For all its beauty, it takes the brave to swim in the Atlantic off Cape Town because it is relatively cold. Interestingly, the water around Cape Town is colder in summer than in winter. Reason: in summer, the ice caps in Antarctica melt into the waters of the Atlantic around Cape Town.There is no need to worry about the chilly weather if you decide to take a dip in the pool at the O&O. I could see steam lightly caressing the surface of the pool, a welcome sight as temperatures started dipping towards evening. It was warmer inside than out; it took lots of willpower to leave the warmth of the water.Wining and Dining There are a few restaurants and bars at the O&O Cape Town. South African celebrity chef Reuben Riffel debuted his first urban restaurant at the O&O Cape Town after opening to much acclaim six years before in Franschhoek.Reuben’s is sophisticated yet unfussy and practical. There were days when I needed breakfast taken up to my room because of work. It was impressive how fast the takeaway packs came out. Plastic cups for coffee too. I could have my own buffet breakfast in the room without having to use the option of room service.There is also the Nobu restaurant, the first in Africa by Japanese master chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa. His innovative blend includes classic Japanese cuisine, South African seafood and Peruvian influences.A particular lively spot at the O&O is the Vista Bar & Lounge situated at the centre of the lobby. As the name implies, it offers panoramic views of the Table Mountain. It is a great spot to socialise as it offers light snacks and afternoon tea daily, then transforms into a bar offering a range of wines and cocktails at night. Considering South Africa’s history with wine, it is no surprise that there is a dedicated Wine Loft where guests can discover a collection of over 5,000 bottles with emphasis on prestigious vintages as well as up-and-coming South African wines.My group had a bit of wine tasting as well but it was at the Isola restaurant located at one of the lush private islands.The restaurant which also services guests around the pool offers a dining experience with a Mediterranean twist. However, we were in for a special surprise.The chef knew we were coming for lunch and decided jollof rice would be an option on our menu. It turned out to be everyone’s choice. Even Ashleigh, who joined us for lunch. She joked that the chef was nervous; he wasn’t sure if we would approve.As an aside, we Nigerians are known to be finicky about our food; most of us need more spice, pepper, chilli… we need the food to be hot and tasty. The chef at the O&O need not worry. We wanted to know how long he spent in Nigeria. Never been to Nigeria. Cookbook.His jollof rice – with a signature twist – got top marks from everyone around the table. One more example of how much effort and attention to detail the team at the O&O puts into making guests feel at home.
After months of hints and preliminaries, stumbles and awkward exchanges, Hillary Clinton will today take the wraps off her campaign for the presidency in 2016.The roll-out will be deliberately underwhelming. No whoosh, razzmattazz or confetti, no helicopters or Clinton grandiosity. No expressions of entitlement. The substance of her Twitter announcement and short video message will not be that a Clinton is running for the White House again - no surprise to anyone - but to appeal to voters with a coherent message outlining why she wants the presidency and for what purpose.Clinton gave a hint of that with a new epilogue to her memoir, Hard Choices, posted on the web on Friday, in which she said - referring to her granddaughter - that she was convinced that the future of America depended "on our ability to ensure a child born in the hills of Appalachia or the Rio Grande valley grows up with the same shot at success that Charlotte will".But will that, or the 18-month campaign to follow, be enough to reset voters' opinions of Clinton, which have barely shifted over nearly 25 years of the Clintonland experience? It will be up to her clean-cut, 35-year-old political director, Robby Mook, to steer the candidate away from the campaign misadventure that doomed her 2008 effort to establish the Clintons as a dynastic political enterprise.The Vermont-born Mook will be the first openly gay manager of a major presidential campaign. He takes the reins of the campaign with a track record as a low-key but formidable political operative.Clinton advisers anticipate that he is close enough to the Clinton inner circle to be trusted, but experienced enough to challenge negative aspects of the Clinton package, from political self-entitlement to the blurred boundaries of the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.Mook's appointment is of a different order to that of James Carville, the loudmouth who directed Bill Clinton's first presidential bid. Selecting Mook, aides say, is indicative of Hillary Clinton's desire for a low-drama operation. Mook is rarely quoted in news stories; he has no Facebook page; and he has forgotten the password of his Twitter account. "He does not seek out the spotlight and in fact does everything he can to avoid it," pollster Geoff Garin told the political magazine Mother Jones last week.Indeed, the manner of Clinton's announcement today will be in sharp contrast to the lack of political sophistication expressed by her 2008 launch address when, coiffured and placed in a chintzy drawing room, she invited voters "to start a conversation" - an invitation that voters declined.This time, Clinton aides say, the machine will be stripped of grandiosity and roll in a more humble fashion in an attempt to play up Clinton's of-the-people attributes and show empathy with average American middle-class voters yet to benefit from the upturn in the economy over the past two years. But with polls showing the Republican challenger Rand Paul ahead in Colorado and Iowa polls, Mook's primary responsibility will be to fashion a modern political campaign from Clinton's new Brooklyn headquarters.In his track record, which includes working on Howard Dean's 2004 campaign for the Democratic nomination, there is only one qualification that matters: running the successful Virginia governorship campaign for Clinton insider Terry McAuliffe last November.McAuliffe's first campaign for office had suffered many of the problems of Clinton's 2008 effort. Both relied on old friends and advisers; both stumbled against better-organised, data-driven operations. And it was Mook who had run rare successful primary operations for Clinton in Nevada, Ohio and Indiana."Robby understands modern campaigns, the value of data and technology," Obama adviser David Plouffe told Bloomberg in 2013. "He beat us three times; his footprint was on our back. He did the best job of anyone over there."According to the political legend that already surrounds McAuliffe's improbable November victory, Mook is fastidious about campaign discipline and quashing infighting. "He wanted to make sure it was based on the most recent tactics and to make sure the campaign was strategic and data-focused," said Michael Halle, who managed field operations. Friends say Mook is a political nerd who lives and dies by data. During the McAuliffe campaign, recalls Halle, he was "absolutely anal about every meeting ending with action items".Last month ABC News published excerpts of Mook operation emails. The so-called "Mook Mafia" - Mook is a close friend of Marlon Marshall, who stepped down as a White House aide in January - spoke of wanting to "smite Republicans Mafia-style". Mook added: "F U Republicans. Mafia till I die."Recent reports describe the difficulty that Mook faces corralling Clinton's vast network of advisers, fixers, donors, lackeys, celebrity hangers-on and campaign veterans, as well as friends of the family triumvirate, into a coherent enterprise. "They just keep building on all of the people who are well intentioned, well meaning, extremely loyal. But all have an opinion and want to be heard," said Patti Solis Doyle, former campaign manager for Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, to Mother Jones."The new boy on the block has to learn who those people are, how to accommodate them, and, importantly, how to harness them towards the common enterprise," noted one Clinton insider.One of Mook's toughest roles may be muzzling Bill Clinton, whose outbursts in 2008 did little to help his wife's campaign. The former president has already taken umbrage with the New York Times after it detailed ongoing efforts by his wife's advisers to harness his "rare gifts and rash impulses".While he will be included in strategic planning, his wife's team will - according to the paper - likely assign him a senior aide in an effort to keep him on message.Mook and the former president have a "great relationship", says McAuliffe. "But Robby is happiest when he is in his office with his computers and his data."A large part of Mook's job, then, will be to silence the kind of distractions that have characterised Clinton's shadow second run for the presidency this year: more than a dozen trips that Bill Clinton took on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, dubbed the "Lolita express"; and how she erased emails on her home server which she used to conduct government business; or problems with foreign donations to the Clinton foundation - all while she served as secretary of state.The son of a physics lecturer and a hospital administrator, Mook got his start in political campaign organisation as a 16-year-old on the phone banks for the Clinton-Gore 1996 campaign. After graduating from Columbia with a degree in classics six years later, he joined Dean's insurgent presidential run. Just 23 then, he is still remembered as a workaholic.But the political neophyte learned on that campaign that you can't compensate for a flawed candidate.Word from within the Clinton camp suggests that Mook will get his way. He is said to have advised the candidate to speak out quickly and aggressively on the email issue, but Clinton took days to respond and, when she did, it was before a packed press conference, not a one-on-one sitdown with a campaign-selected interviewer.Can Mook establish control over the Clintons? "It's very difficult," said Solis Doyle. "I will tell you that."
The mobile telephone numbers of Rivers State Governor, Rotimi Amaechi, were cloned by unknown persons hours before the governorship and House of Assembly elections on Saturday.The cloned phone numbers were thereafter used to send fake text messages, discouraging people from coming out to vote for candidates of their choices.In a brief statement sent to journalists while the election lasted, the Chief Press Secretary to the governor, Mr. David Iyofor, called on voters to disregard the fake text messages, pointing out that Amaechi’s position was for the people to come out in droves to exercise their civic responsibilities.He said: “This is to inform members of the public that the telephone numbers of Governor Rotimi Amaechi have been cloned and the criminals who did the cloning are using it to send out fake text messages to people not to come out and vote. Please that text message is not from Governor Amaechi.“The Governor’s position remains that Rivers’ voters should come out to vote today (Saturday). People should disregard that fake text message.”Meanwhile, the governor during his accreditation in Ubima, his hometown in the Ikwerre Local Government Area earlier on Saturday, accused the Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Mrs. Gecila Khan, of working tirelessly to ensure victory for the Peoples Democratic Party in Rivers.Amaechi, who arrived the community in company with his wife, Judith, around 11:20am, said the irregularities witnessed during voting in the state was as a result of the refusal of the INEC Chairman, Prof. Attahiru Jega, to change Khan as REC in the state.He said: “I am disappointed at the INEC for not redeploying the REC. She is the reason why we encountered problem of thugs hijacking electoral materials.“Some people and officials of INEC were ambushed with important electoral materials carted away. All these things are not supposed to be. I heard elections did not hold in several places like in Obio/Akpor, Asari-Toru and other places in the state. But if she had been changed, things wouldn’t have been like this.”Also on Saturday, INEC’s National Commissioner in Akwa Ibom, Cross River and Rivers states, Thelma Iremiren, while debunking rumours that electoral materials distributed in Rivers were fake, said: “We received with dismay news that materials in the field were fake. We wish to inform the public, especially the people of Rivers State that no fake materials were ever released by INEC into the field and as such, voters should go out and vote their leaders.”Saturday’s governorship election in the oil-rich Rivers witnessed low turnout of voters as a result of heightened tension in the area. In most of the wards and polling units visited, barely half of the number that turned out during the March 28 Presidential elections came out to exercise their rights this time. There was heavy security presence in many parts of Port Harcourt, while the exercise lasted.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Hank Marvin and Django Reinhardt have something in common. Just as Reinhardt was the first non-American to be a true jazz innovator with his Gypsy swing, Marvin (with the Shadows) was the first non-American guitar hero in rock's early days, becoming a role model for the likes of George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. Now Marvin, a Perth resident for three decades, has reinvented himself as a Reinhardt disciple.That, in itself, is unremarkable. In the last 20 years Reinhardt has become the most aped guitarist in history, with entire festivals dedicated to his legacy. But where countless players lose their own identity in worshipping at Django's altar, Marvin's musical personality is too strong for that to happen. He largely eschews the lightning-fast runs that have become synonymous with the idiom, instead concentrating on lyricism, melodic relevance, tone and note shape.Of course the famous Stratocaster has been jettisoned for a Django-style acoustic, most of the repertoire was by or associated with Reinhardt and the groove has changed to swing, but within all that Marvin extracted a highly distinctive sound: much brighter than Reinhardt's, almost like a resonator guitar.The band sound was distinctive, too, thanks to Nunzio Mondia's virtuoso accordion playing. Although accordions have become common in Gypsy swing circles, Mondia loaded the music with flighty atmospherics and modernist abstractions as well as working within the swinging and lyrical vernacular.Driving the band were Gary Taylor's rhythm guitar and bassist Robbie Pisano's bass, and Marvin, Mondia and Taylor have arrived at striking arrangements full of watertight unisons and sneaky syncopations.Perhaps inevitably they shoehorned some Shadows songs into the idiom, with Guitar Tango working especially well. Marvin played a glorious solo on Django's Castle, each note seeming to glisten, until it was more like a dream unfolding than a song. Collectively they may not reach the high art of Reinhardt but I prefer their marriage of whimsy and slickness to the hordes of straight copyists.
General voter apathy characterised Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly elections in Delta State.The elections were also peaceful in a number of places though a number of issues were recorded with the voter card readers as many voters’ fingerprints could not be captured.At St. John Bosco Catholic Church voting centre, Unit 7, Ward 8, Oshimili Local Government Area, only 17 voters out of about 400 registered voters were accredited at about noon.The Delta State Commissioner for Information, Mr. Chike Ogeah, who was at the centre, wondered why the turnout fell.“I came here about the same time for the presidential election. And I met a larger crowd here. Maybe, the people are just relaxed this time around,” Ogeah said.There was also a stricter enforcement of the restriction of vehicular movement by the military on Saturday, as against the presidential election when restriction in the northern parts of the state was mild.Army personnel seized the keys of many vehicles that violated the vehicle restriction order.A case of violence was reported at Ebedeni Ward 6, Ndokwa East Local Government Area, where three gunmen snatched ballot papers and materials.Polling materials in the North senatorial zone arrived quite early and that led to early accreditation and voting.But collation of results at the ward levels were delayed by a downpour that kept virtually all the polling unit officials stranded at their bases till quite late on Saturday.Copyright PUNCH.

Finance Minister Mathias Cormann is optimistic that a deal can be reached over how GST revenue is carved up to help Western Australia through a damaging slump in the iron ore price.But the WA senator says the state government has got show it is willing to undertake reforms to boost its economy.State and territory treasurers rejected an idea to freeze the GST distribution at 2014/15 levels to prevent WA's share slump to less than 30 cents for every dollar spent in 2015/16.But Senator Cormann would like to think that on reflection the country's leaders will strike a deal when the Council of Australian Governments meets this week."We haven't reached the end of the process yet," Senator Cormann told Sky News on Sunday.He said by freezing GST relativities, each state would still be better off with an increase of five to six per cent in revenue compared to this financial year.But he said WA has to show a willingness to reform, such as undertaking privatisation, and he rejected WA Premier Colin Barnett's view that these issues aren't linked."There is no doubt in my mind that the West Australian government has to do better in the pursuit of economic reform," he said."The fact that they don't seem to have more of a sense of urgency around that, in my mind, weakens their argument in relation to GST distribution."Labor front bencher Mark Butler said there was an important principle of the Commonwealth that the nation's wealth, as far as possible, be distributed equally."While some of the mining states may suffer a bit of a boom and bust in terms of their revenue, the idea of sticking to that principle at the heart of the nature of the Commonwealth is a very important one," he told Sky News.
Communities opposing the controversial technique of fracking have cast doubt on the West Australian Government's independence when granting approvals for the industry.Nationals MP Shane Love said locals in his electorate of Moore, which covers part of the Mid West and Wheatbelt, have expressed concern about the role the Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) plays."People are saying to me they're confused as to how the regulator and the promoter can be rolled into the one organisation," he said."Part of the role of the department is to actually actively promote the mining and petroleum industries in Western Australia and I think most people would accept that as a legitimate role for the department."I think what confuses people [is that] it's also the main regulator of those activities once they've encouraged them to come into Western Australia."The industry has developed rapidly in the US, creating a storm of controversy, and is in its infancy in WA, with exploration underway across the Mid West and Kimberley.The DMP has been a big promoter, travelling to affected communities, selling the message of future jobs and energy security.Conservation Council WA director Piers Verstegen said the department had a clear conflict of interest."There's a whole range of engagement that the department has been undertaking on behalf of the gas fracking industry, including lobbying councillors and engaging with local councils to try and suppress local opposition to gas fracking," he said."This is a real concern when we've got local councils trying to respond to their local communities."Emails obtained by the ABC under Freedom of Information show the department has been holding meetings with resource companies involved in WA's shale gas industry.One email stated: "The focus of this meeting was to develop key messages for industry and how they align with governments..."Another said: "We will also have a straw man of our key messages ... which we can share as part of discussions about respective stories and can talk to our media approach as well."Critics like Mr Verstegen argued the approach showed the department was in the industry's pocket, helping it develop its public relations spin."We're actually seeing taxpayer funded public relations experts working within government agencies on behalf of the industry to promote the industry," he said."This is really concerning when it's the same agency that is supposed to be protecting communities from the impacts of gas fracking."This role the DMP has taken on to promote gas fracking is very much counterproductive because it's really leading to a lot of mistrust of that agency by the community."Political analyst Martin Drum also warned against the department promoting the industry before proposals have been approved."Some of the information appears to indicate that tactics are being devised to help mitigate potential opposition to projects which haven't yet been approved," he said."I would think the Government should be working with companies once their projects have already been approved."It could be seen as Government colluding with a proponent over the interests of local community opposition - that's where the potential problem could lie."Mr Love said WA should follow the lead of some European nations and separate the two roles to put the community at ease."In other jurisdictions that does happen, so for instance in northern Europe, where we would look to see strong environmental controls, certainly in Norway the functions are split," he said."Some time ago they split into a department of petroleum and one also involved in the safety aspects of the petroleum industry, so there's two different directorates looking after that industry because of that inherent view of conflict between the two."Similarly, in Holland, the organisation that oversees mining and other activities there answers to three separate ministers, so while it's the one organisation, it has three masters."So I suppose there are ways we could look to in Western Australia to give greater confidence to the community that the organisation is doing its job properly."Mines Minister Bill Marmion would not be interviewed for this story, but in a statement defended his department's approach.He said he had full confidence in the DMP to play a role in both the approval and regulation of mining proposals, and that the streamlining of processes had not reduced the scrutiny it placed on mining proposals.
Accreditation of voters in the governorship and House of Assembly elections in Ebonyi State went on smoothly on Saturday in various polling units without many incidences with card readers, but there was widespread voter apathy.In the polling units our correspondent visited in Abakaliki metropolis, the state capital, polling officers were practically idle as voters trickled in to be accredited.At polling units 002 and 003, in Ezikwo Primary School located in Abakaliki Local Government Area, voters did not come out on time for the accreditation exercise.For instance, of the 384 registered voters listed to vote at polling unit 003, only 39 turned up for accreditation as of 11.27am on Saturday.“And out of the 39 voters that turned up for accreditation, the card reader authenticated the identity of 27, while the 12 others had to fill incident forms,” an ad-hoc staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission, said.Sunday PUNCH learnt that the failure of most voters to turn up for the election followed general apprehension over acts of violence and intimidation that characterised the March 28 presidential and National Assembly elections.At Umuebe polling unit in Ohaukwu Local Government Area, where former Ebonyi State governor, Dr. Sam Egwu and his wife, Eunice, were accredited, the card readers functioned properly, but the few prospective voters hung around for fear of violence.Egwu, who is a senator-elect on the ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party, said he was disappointed at the level of violence and intimidation in the state during the recent elections.He added, “I understand opposition parties have been forcing people on where to vote. Apart from that, we are getting reports that people are being intimidated by thugs from outside the state. People should be allowed to vote freely. We have never experienced this level of violence in Ebonyi State.”When contacted at his office, the Administrative Secretary of INEC in Ebonyi State, Mr. Chinedu Evurulobi, said the body had referred issues of security to the concerned agencies.Concerning misplacement of materials and circulation of fake result sheets, the INEC administrative secretary said, “We had those issues last time because there wasn’t enough time to look at those papers and result sheets, but we have resolved all that now.”He said, “We had enough time to obtain the materials, and we have had enough time to study and verify the result sheets and the ballot papers. And people are doing fine because we have cleared issues of such confusion.”Evurulobi added that appropriately designated and customised result sheets were released to the electoral officers.Copyright PUNCH.

Not less than seven persons, including a former chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party in Ishielu Local Government Area, Mr. Mike Nworie, were killed in chain of violence that trailed the governorship and state House of Assembly elections in Ebonyi State on Saturday.Nworie, who was also a former chairman of Inyaba Development Centre, was hacked down by political thugs in Ishielu council, while six other young men were killed in Ezza South Local Government Area of the state.“The former PDP chairman was killed while he was receiving a call bordering on the elections. His killers were obviously trailing him and when the right opportunity struck, they hacked him with multiple numbers of weapons and ensured he was dead before leaving the scene,” an eyewitness told our correspondent.The eyewitness, who is a pastor of one of the known Pentecostal churches, begged not to be mentioned.In Okposi town, Ohaozara Local Government Area, political thugs allegedly working for the ruling party and led by a perceived gangster, called ‘Chopper’, attacked the Labour Party and All Progressives Congress agents at different polling units.The political thugs who were said to have ridden with a team of ‘soldiers’ in a Hillux van, marked with bold ‘Army’ inscription, allegedly bundled five polling unit agents at PU 007, Mgbom Okposi; PU 007, Achara ward; and the polling unit at Enechi Akuma Primary School, Okposi Okwu ward.“Voters in those polling units, scampered away from the polling units leaving the area deserted and the exercise suspended,” a concerned citizen stated in a text message to our correspondent.In Ishiagu, Ivo Local Government Area, police officers and officials of the State Security Service were said to have been detained in a private facility on the orders of a high-ranking official of the Federal Government from the area.In Ohaukwu and Ikwo councils, some hoodlums allegedly snatched money meant for polling agents while several persons were left with broken limbs at Ndiagara.“I was reliably informed of the money snatching incident,” a former governor of the state, Dr. Sam Egwu, said.Ikwo Local Government Area, where Governor Martin Elechi hails from, was a no-go area as heavy shooting commenced as early as 8am, while there were several cases of snatching of election materials.“The violence in Ikwo left a woman dead,” a state government official told Sunday PUNCH at about 2.00pm on Saturday.Copyright PUNCH.

QUETTA, Pakistan - Gunmen attacked a Pakistani construction site and killed 20 labourers as they slept on Saturday, a government official said, in what appeared to be further violence by rebels seeking to control resources in the gas and mineral-rich Baluchistan province.Separatists have been fighting a low-intensity insurgency in the province for decades, demanding an end to what they see as the exploitation of their resources by people from other parts of Pakistan.The workers killed at a construction site 15 km from the town of Turbat were mostly from outside Baluchistan, suggesting the Baluch rebels were responsible, according to provincial interior minister Akbar Hussain Durrani."All were sleeping in their camp when they were targeted," he said.He quoted three wounded survivors as saying that around 15-20 gunmen overpowered eight guards from a government paramilitary force, then opened fire on the sleeping men with automatic weapons. They escaped on motorcycles.A man claiming to be a spokesman for the banned Baluch Liberation Front called local reporters and said his group had carried out the attack as a reprisal for military operations in the area.The separatists frequently kidnap and kill civilians from other parts of the country and also attack gas facilities, infrastructure and security posts.Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran, is Pakistan's poorest and most thinly populated province.Human rights groups say the security agencies often arrest ethnic Baluch, torture them and dump their bodies in a policy that has become known as "Kill and Dump."Some families say that children as young as 11 have been arrested and their bodies later found in shallow graves.Baluchistan is also home to Taliban insurgents, drug smugglers, kidnapping rings, sectarian militants, and government-backed paramilitary death squads.
The governorship /House of Assembly elections in Imo State went without hitches on Saturday with electoral materials arriving at respective polling units on time.Before the election, it was speculated that the election would be chaotic in the South East state.Our correspondent who monitored the election in Orlu (Imo west) geopolitical zone of the state reported that most of the polling units visited were calm during the election processes.At Amaigwe polling unit, booth 022 Ihitenansa in Orsu Local Government Area LGA, accreditation started at about 8:20am.The presiding officer of the booth, Dr. Uwahemu Kizito, said voting should start at exactly, 1.40pm after accreditation.Also at Community Primary School Ohukabia, Awo-Idemili, the presiding officer,who pleaded anonymity, said that accreditation commenced at about 8:10pm.Owing to the rainfall and dilapidated nature of the school, accreditation was delayed in order to prevent the materials from getting wet.Equally at Nobis Primary School Ubulu in Oru West LGA, the presiding officer stated that accreditation began about 9:12 am and that voters came out en masse.Meanwhile, voting started in most polling units in the zone around 2pm.However, our reporter observed that at Ukwu Ofor polling unit booth 003 in Ubahadara, Amorie- Ubulu, voting started with crisis.Voting stopped forthwith when a group of men suspected to be PDP supporters swooped on the place and smashed INEC materials.Though no person was wounded nor killed, they made away with the sensitive materials. As of 4.27pm, voting in most LGAs of the state was still going on.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Three gunmen, at about 1.30 pm on Saturday, stormed a voting unit at Ebedeni Ward 6, in the Ndokwa East Local Government Area of Delta State and snatched ballot papers and boxes.Before escaping, the gunmen descended on the only policeman at the station, removed her head dress and took away her identity card before escaping.The Resident Electoral Commissioner in the state, Mr. Aniedi Ikiowak, was said to have visited the place shortly after the incident. But he could not be contacted on phone immediately.
WESTERN BULLDOGS 3.5 5.8 10.13 12.13 (85) RICHMOND 2.3 3.6 6.8 9.12 (66)  Goals: Western Bulldogs: T Dickson 4, J Stringer 2, S Crameri 2, E Wood, J Grant, M Honeychurch, M Wallis. Richmond: J Riewoldt 2, B Griffiths, C Newman, D Grimes, D Martin, N Gordon, R Petterd, S Lloyd. Best: Western Bulldogs: M Bontempelli, M Wallis, J Macrae, T Dickson, M Talia, M Boyd, B Murphy. Richmond: A Rance, D Martin, T Cotchin, A Miles, J Batchelor, B Ellis. Umpires: Shane McInerney, Jordan Bannister, Andrew Stephens.   Official Crowd: 49,945 at MCG.It is already clear that Luke Beveridge intends having his Western Bulldogs play a quicker, more attacking game than they had previously. But that doesn't mean the less glamorous aspects of the game are going to be overlooked, either.The Dogs had already shown under Brendan McCartney that they could hold their own in a contested situation. And in Saturday's 19-point win over Richmond, there was a notable streak of mental toughness, too.The Bulldogs led this game from start to finish. But it didn't mean there weren't several occasions on which their opposition threatened. And each time Beveridge's side responded in the perfect manner, nipping any potential comeback by the Tigers in the bud.It happened midway through the third term, when the Doggies had built a 27-point lead, only for Richmond key forwards Ben Griffiths then Jack Riewoldt to escape the shackles applied by Jordan Roughead and Michael Talia long enough to kick two quick goals.The strangely silent Tiger hordes began to find their voice. But within five minutes, the Bulldogs led by even more than previously, thanks to goals to Jake Stringer and Jarrad Grant.Again in the final term, Richmond threatened with early goals to Chris Newman and Riewoldt, the gap again back to just 16 points. And again, the Bulldogs managed to steady things long enough not to let a trickle become a flood, Tory Dickson's fourth goal of the game and one to Easton Wood effectively settling the result a good 10 minutes before the end.They'd deserved the points well before that in a very even effort across the board. Not that there weren't standouts.Like – and we'll be saying this often enough over the next decade or so – the sublime Marcus Bontempelli, who began slowly but sure made up for lost time with a game in equal parts prolific, strong and creative – 27 touches, 10 tackles and three score assists making that pretty obvious.Mitch Wallis and Jack Macrae weren't as spectacular as "The Bont", but not a lot less effective around the ball, and in defence, Talia particularly was a standout, the influence of Riewoldt and Griffiths, despite that third-quarter cameo, negligible.Their efforts were able to fill the breach left by the underperforming Bulldogs tall forwards, Dickson and the likes of Stewart Crameri and Stringer able to bob up where the key-position likes of Tom Boyd and Ayce Cordy couldn't.Richmond had two standout performers in Alex Rance, who not only pulled the shutters down on Boyd, but became one of his side's most prolific possession winners besides, and the always-creative Dustin Martin.But Martin's brilliance by foot only served to highlight how many of his teammates were butchering the ball. Martin must have been tearing his hair out after setting up first Ben Griffiths then Ricky Petterd with superb passes early in the game, only for both to spray their shots.The Bulldogs' issue was more their key forwards not getting a sniff. Boyd took his first mark of the match a couple of minutes before half-time and in the defensive 50. He and Cordy had the grand total of four disposals and that same mark between them at the long break.Their opponents, meanwhile, were doing all sorts of damage. If any key defender has a better first half this year than Rance did in this game, it will be worth watching.Not content with denying Boyd a sniff, Rance became a constant source of rebound, going to the half-time break with 15 disposals and six marks. You wondered by half-time whether Boyd might be reduced to a quasi tagging role.It was the Dogs' smaller forwards and midfielders who had to put the runs on the board. Honeychurch, very busy early, kicked things off, and Tory Dickson and Mitch Wallis gave their side a minor edge by quarter-time.That became 14 points after Jake Batchelor, trying to switch play, kicked across ground to two teammates, only to see Matthew Boyd sweep in between them and set up  Crameri for the easiest of goals.Petterd got the Tigers back in it, before  Stringer strolled into another open goal just before the siren. The margin could have been even greater, too,  Macrae missing a very gettable shot from the restart from only 40 metres.It would have been in keeping with the Dogs of old that missed opportunities like that left open the gate just wide enough for their opponent to charge through.But a strangely flat Richmond seemed not to have enough strength nor, to be frank, the will to do so this time. And they were up against a team which just two rounds into the new football year, already appears to be made of much sterner stuff.

It's a shame the Waltons, that historic family who showed the world how to survive the Great Depression, were probably too much the church-going stoics to come down from their rickety but packed home and kick up some dust in a dancehall.It would be a nickel well spent for all of them if they'd seen Mr Pokey LaFarge's show, for here was some good-time music that would make you forget for an hour or so the grimness of daily life, the discomfort of worn out, hand-me-down shoes and the way Grandpa's pigs are always under foot and, frankly, a bit stinky.I reckon Mary Ellen would have hitched up that flat grey skirt just a little bit to the spritely La La Blues; I'm sure Jason would have enjoyed taking that fresh-faced blonde from the other side of Walton's Mountain for a two-step during Something In The Water. And even Grandma would have swayed a little in her seat during the strolling Let's Get Lost.What's that? The Waltons weren't real? There is no Walton's Mountain? And Mary Ellen's husband was played by a different actor in the later series? Whatever! I know that LaFarge and band are real. And not just plenty fun in wool vest, work denim and neat bow tie, but excellent players behind a frontman who might swing from more sophisticated Jimmie Rodgers to more suburban Cab Calloway to that nice man from the Brillo adver-tise-ment.Chloe Feoranzo (sax and clarinet) and TJ Muller (cornet and banjo) parped and crooned; guitarist Adam Hoskins was even more light-fingered than bass player Joey Glenn and if drummer Matthew Meyer hit more often than he brushed, it was a sign, like the roistering harmonica of Ryan Koenig, that we were here for a dance not a recital.That LaFarge is based in Missouri these days is not just coincidental. His songs, both old and original, sit at a junction of between the wars jazz, pared down blues, down from the mountains country, party time swing and the early days of boogie-woogie. It is far more Kansas City and St Louis than New York or Chicago or New Orleans.Unlike another band of traditional revivalists, the Sacred Shakers, LaFarge and friends aren't much for the church (though it creeps in a bit) and they don't share the occasional phantasmagorical bent of our own C. W. Stoneking. They have a simpler focus: party time, excellent.You'd have them back in this holler I reckon, right Pa? Yes, you would. Goodnight John-Boy.
Canadian Coast Guard Commissioner Jody Thomas took aim at "what some critics have said in (the) media" on Saturday, insisting the agency's response to a cargo ship oil spill in Vancouver's English Bay was "immediate, measured, effective and it worked."Thomas made the statement at a news conference in Vancouver before an update on the cleanup efforts.On Friday, B.C. Premier Christy Clark said "it took the coast guard six long hours to put in place booms" to contain Wednesday's 2,700-litre spill and "we would have had a much smaller problem if they'd looked after it quicker."Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson had already lashed out at both the federal and provincial governments about the response time, saying the city wasn't told about the spill for 13 hours.On Saturday, Thomas said she would be meeting with Robertson and other city officials following the news conference.Roger Girouard, assistant commissioner for the coast guard's western region, acknowledged the tension over the last few days, saying in this type of situation, there are "moments when it gets inelegant."But Girouard said the cleanup was "working as it should."The MS Marathassa -- the source of the spill -- remained anchored Saturday and wrapped in an oil containment boom as experts determined how much fuel was around the hull.Based on an assessment from the air, he estimated there were less than 10 litres of oil remaining in English Bay as of Saturday.The coast guard was working with the B.C. government to assess about 40 km of beach, Girouard said. The beach cleanup was underway and would take at least the rest of the weekend to complete, he added.They were also working to clean about 30 birds that had tracked oil from the ocean into a pond in Vancouver's Vanier Park, he said.Industry Minister James Moore said Friday that the owners of the Marathassa, not taxpayers, will foot the bill for the cleanup.The Cypriot-flagged bulk carrier was coming into the Vancouver harbour to collect grain when it leaked bunker fuel on Wednesday.--With files from Nicole Riva and Sherry Noik
On Good Friday, an arbitrator restored Josh Hamilton to baseball's good graces. On the following Friday, Arte Moreno declared that Hamilton had not been restored to the Angels' good graces.He never will be, at least not as long as Moreno remains the Angels' owner. The divorce appears inevitable.Moreno could rid himself of Hamilton any day he wants, but he would have to write a check for $83 million. On Friday, when Moreno suggested he might have contractual recourse to recover at least part of that money, the players' union responded with a sharply worded statement that essentially said this: No, you don't.That could trigger a nasty fight, and arbitration. But so could this: What if the Angels took Hamilton back but kept him on the bench?Hamilton would get his full salary, but Moreno would make his displeasure clear with every lineup card in which the outfield was manned by three other guys.The union already is prepared for this possibility. Tony Clark, the executive director, would not speak directly to that scenario on Friday.But the Angels have become increasingly vague about Hamilton's rehabilitation from shoulder surgery. If the rancor from management does not abate, it is not difficult to imagine them letting Hamilton linger in rebuilding his shoulder, then keeping him in the minor leagues for the maximum 20 days of a rehabilitation assignment.Clark was willing to speak to that scenario."When Josh is healthy and ready to play, we expect he will be added to the roster," Clark said.The New York Yankees did just that with Alex Rodriguez. For all the New York bombast about how the supposedly shamed and fragile Rodriguez might just retire — all of it coming from the Yankees, the party that stood to save $61 million if he did — the Yankees put him back in their lineup as soon as he was eligible this year.He batted third Friday. He could be one of the Yankees' best hitters, if not their best.No one would dare say Hamilton could be the Angels' best hitter, and not just because Mike Trout works in Anaheim. The Angels could well say they are better off with Hamilton on their bench, and the union could well say his benching would be strictly punitive.That would be a mess. The union already is livid that the commissioner's office has not launched an investigation into how confidential information about Hamilton's relapse and the subsequent arbitration became public.Could Moreno pay Hamilton something less than $83 million to let him go? The union generally allows players to give back money only in exchange for some other benefit, and accelerated free agency is one. It would be just a little money, maybe very little, but it might be the best deal Moreno could get.His comments Friday, heartfelt though they might have been, all but extinguished the already minuscule chance the Angels had to trade Hamilton. For now, other teams can wait to see whether the Angels simply release him. The union is waiting to see how the Angels treat him.The Dodgers might have the most celebrated rivalry with the San Francisco Giants, but the San Diego Padres might have the most intense one, at least based on a weird incident during the Padres' home opener Thursday.The Giants' Angel Pagan spied a piece of gum in the batter's box. He picked it up and tried to fling it away, but he said the gum stuck to his batting glove, so the gum landed at the feet of Padres catcher Derek Norris.That prompted a rebuke from Norris, and the next pitch came in high and tight from Craig Kimbrel, at 97 mph.After the game, Norris threw a verbal brushback pitch at Pagan."I don't come into center field and throw gum at him when he's playing defense," Norris said.Pagan said Norris blew the incident far out of proportion. Norris said Pagan was being "kind of a ... ."That's a swinging friar right there.
As part of events for the one week of global action organised by the #BringBackOurGirls group aimed at commemorating the one year of the abduction of the Chibok girls from their school in Borno State, special church services will be held today, across the country, for the safe return of the girls.Speaking at a press briefing, one of the leaders of the group, Dr Oby Ezekwesili, stated that the service will also be held to pray for the parents of the girls, other victims of the insurgency, the North-east and the nation.She added that prayers will be said to c ommit the abducted girls into God’s hands in anticipation of a miraculous and supernatural intervention that all effort geared at bringing them back will become successful.On Friday, special Jumat prayers were also offered in mosques for the Chibok girls to come back safely to their families and for peace to be restored in the Northeast.Recall that the group also organised a protest march as parts of its one week global action events aimed at commemorating the one year the Chibok girls were abduction from their school in Borno State.Speaking during the event, Dr Oby Ezekwesili who led the group stated that the protest was to remind the government and the Nigerians that 219 Chibok were still in the hands of their captors even as the days are rounding up to a year when the incident occured.“We are heading to one year of the abduction. We have continued our sit-out. We have been standing since their abduction. Soon it will be 365, one full calender. The theme for our one year commemoration is ‘364 Days On, Chibok Girls — Never To Be Forgotten’ They will never be forgotten”.“We are reminding people that for over 300 days the girls have not be rescued. We believed that they can be rescued. We have cities all over the world remembering these girls. The red ribbons we tie on the polls is a reminder that our Chibok girls are not back. People want to move on. But we refuse to move on”, she said.The group has also urged school girls who want to be the #ChibokGirls Ambassadors, from ages ten to eighteen to register so that they could stand and march for the missing Chibok schoolgirls come 14 April.It has also called on different schools in the country to also organise a march as part of the Global School Girls March to reawaken the public of the fact that the girls were still not yet home to their parents.
Jordan Spieth held at bay a gallery of golfing greats at the Masters for most of Saturday's third round before a nervy finish opened the door slightly for his closest rivals.Leading by a record-equaling five shots at the halfway stage of the year's first major, Spieth had already felt the heat from the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods even before he teed off at Augusta National.Then Phil Mickelson entered the fray with a triple-birdie blast early on that hauled the three-time former winner into firm contention. Finally, England's Justin Rose came at him late in the day.But they all needed Spieth to falter and he gave few signs of doing that before coughing up a double-bogey at the 17th.By the end of the day, Spieth, with a two-under par 70 for a Masters-record 54-hole total of 200, was four ahead of Rose, who had birdies at 16 and 18 for a 67.Mickelson, who also had a 67, was alone in third on 205 with fellow American Charley Hoffman a further stroke back after a 71.Woods and McIlroy were on 210, 10 shots off the lead along with Dustin Johnson (73), Kevin Streelman (70) and Kevin Na (70)."Felt a little different because I played in the morning yesterday. I had a long time. I had 24 hours from the time I finished to the time I teed off. That's a long time to sit on a lead like that," he said."Now we're finishing in the evening, it may help just to get back, get some rest, and be ready for tomorrow."Spieth had set Augusta National alight with opening rounds of 64 and 66 that saw him record 15 birdies against just one bogey.In so doing, he became the youngest player to lead the Masters after the first round, and his 130 halfway total was the lowest-ever in 79 editions of the year's first major.He was firmly in a winning position, but remained aware that he still had much to do, as he learned last year when he led the Masters after 54 holes, but ended up tied for second behind Bubba Watson.A slippery five-footer brought a birdie at the second, but he misread his short putt at the fourth to record just his second bogey of the tournament.A superb 22-footer for birdie at the par-three sixth was then followed by a poor bunker shot at the next that handed him a second bogey.Hardly the kind of play that had stunned the galleries and his rivals in his superb opening rounds, but at that stage he was still where he was when he started the day -- five shots ahead of the field.Woods, Mickelson and McIlroy all went out in 32 and the steady Hoffman was stubbornly holding on with a run of pars.But Spieth kept them at arm's length and then birdies at the 12th and 13th going around Amen Corner moved him further clear.Short birdie putts at 15 and 16 increased his lead to seven shots, although he nipped a chip at the 17th for his third bogey of the round and then three putted for double-bogey at the next hole to leave the door ajar.Four-time former winner Mickelson, whose round of 67 included a stupendous 40-foot birdie putt at the 16th, said that after a poor season for him so far Augusta National at the weekend had once again brought out the best in him."It really is the best," he said.Woods, who came in with a 68 for his first back-to-back score in the 60s in a major since the 2012 British Open, and first at the Masters since 2005, said he felt his fine play was not reflected on his scorecard."I had my chances to make this a really special round," he said. "I had it going a little bit. I missed a couple of shorties and six and seven. A realistic score would have been 6- or 7- (under) today.The four-time former winner, however, had the satisfaction of proving he is starting to get his game back after a wretched start to the year which forced him to take a self-imposed timeout to work out what was going wrong.McIlroy, who saw his hopes of becoming just the sixth player to win all four majors all but blown out of the water despite a 68, said that time was on his side to one day win at Augusta National."I definitely feel like I play this golf course better and better every year that I come here," he said. "I just need to keep putting numbers up like I did today. I know I'm capable of it."
Goodbye until September for the Kings and farewell to the NHL for defenseman Robyn Regehr.It was a day of bittersweet partings for the Kings and their fans and for Regehr and his 15-season NHL career. The team's regular-season finale was a 4-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks on Saturday afternoon at Staples Center. The Kings are out of the playoffs for the first time since 2009.Regehr punched the clock in his true-professional fashion — registering three hits and finishing a plus-one — and said in the dressing room afterward that he has probably played his last professional game."I think it's time to move on to the next chapter in life," said Regehr, who will turn 35 on April 19.He achieved his ultimate career goal by winning a Stanley Cup with the Kings last year. Regehr and Kings Coach Darryl Sutter came within a game of winning the Cup when they were together in Calgary in the Flames' 2004 run.Sutter and Regehr were reunited when the Kings acquired the defenseman in a trade with the Buffalo Sabres in 2013 and Regehr told Kings General Manager Dean Lombardi that he felt he could give them two hard years."There's a lot that goes into a decision like that," Regehr said. "I've been thinking about it for a little while. You've got to think about where your body is at and how it's holding up or not holding up."There's family decisions and all kinds of stuff that are involved in a decision like that. It's a big decision. But I think we've decided."Said Kings Coach Darryl Sutter: "We lost a Game 7 in the Stanley Cup [Final] with Calgary, so to get him here and win one here is awesome. He's not only a good player, he's a great person. The best thing about when we got Robyn here was there's a lot of young defensemen here. If you look at their seasons, they're going to learn a lot from Robyn Regehr, all those young players."Robyn and Greener [Matt Greene] are the quarterbacks back there, in the locker room, and in terms of professionalism and every one of those other guys, they're going to miss Robyn. They're going to have to take a step forward now."Kings forward Justin Williams wryly noted that Regehr is only about a year and a half older than he."He didn't fade after the sunset," Williams said. "Now he's going to be a dad for the rest of the time."Williams and Kings center Jarret Stoll are on expiring contracts and this might have been their last game with the Kings. Stoll said he looked at the two Cup championship banners during the national anthem and had "chills." He was not sure about his future, saying: "I'd come back, hopefully any kind of role, to be honest. If we make the playoffs and we have a chance to win the Stanley Cup, I would play absolutely any role."Williams said his focus has been on the season rather than his future with the Kings' organization and pending unrestricted free agency. Playing in a meaningless game was painful for Williams."We have not played a game like that in a long time," he said. "Reality will set in that we won't be playing in the playoffs and have a chance to defend the Cup … that's what really stinks."Said Kings defenseman Drew Doughty: "It's going to be difficult, but everyone in here wants everyone back. Everyone loves each other like brothers…. You never want to lose someone on your team. We hope to keep everyone together, but we know it will be difficult for Dean to do that."Sutter was unequivocal about his coaching future with the Kings, whether reporters would see him in September."Absolutely," he said. "What do you mean see me? Am I invisible?"
China’s government has threatened to shut down Sina, one of the country’s most popular news websites unless it “improves censorship”, state media reported, in a rare public glimpse into controls over the press.The online portal “distorted news facts, violated morality and engaged in media hype”, the official Xinhua news agency on Saturday cited the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) as saying.The CAC will “seriously” punish Sina, with possible measures including “a complete shut down of its Internet news services”, Xinhua added.CAC officials added that “censorship of user accounts has been poor”, Xinhua said, in a likely reference to Sina Weibo, a service similar to Twitter which has hundreds of millions of registered users in China.The report did not provide specifics on which of Sina’s news offerings had fallen foul of censors, but said the CAC accused Sina of spreading “illegal  information related to rumors, violence and terrorism”, and “advocation of heresies”.Chinese authorities have in the past used “heresy” to refer to content related to banned religious groups, such as the Falun Gong.The Chinese government generally operates its control over media behind the scenes, with secret directives on how to report stories. Journalists who disobey or leak the orders can be punished.Controls have tightened under China’s current president Xi Jinping. The France-based group Reporters Without Borders ranked China 175 out of 180 countries in its 2014 worldwide index of press freedom.“Chinese web giant Sina will face suspension of its Internet news services if it fails to improve censorship,” Communist party mouthpiece the People’s Daily wrote on Twitter, a site which is blocked by Chinese authorities.China in 2013 launched a crackdown on “online rumours”, with several people posting content deemed untrue jailed in a campaign seen as an attempt to rein in online debate on microblogging services.The campaign prompted a number of prominent government critics to quit microblogging or tone down their comments, and was blamed for a drop in Sina Weibo use.Sina’s portal is the fourth most visited website in China, according to ranking service Alexa. Neither Sina nor CAC could not immediately be reached  for comment on Sunday.
The reform, which David Cameron will announce today, would see the tax-free allowance raised to £500,000 per person where a property is involved.In effect, the move will mean only the wealthiest in the country will have to pay the hated 40 per cent tax.The cost will be met by restricting pension tax relief for those earning more than £150,000 a year, just one per cent of the population.Announcing the decision today, the Prime Minister will say: “The wish to pass something on is about the most basic, human and natural instinct there is."That’s why for a long, long time I have wanted to act on inheritance.“We’ve already done some important things. With the Conservatives, people can pass on their ISAs, and they’ll be able to pass on their pension pot tax-free.“I can tell you today that the next Conservative government would go much further."We will take the family home out of inheritance tax."That home that you have worked and saved for belongs to you and your family.“You should be able to pass it on to your children.“And with the Conservatives, the taxman will not get his hands on it.“You will be able to pass on up to £1million per couple completely tax-free."Because if you have worked hard and done the right thing all your life, we in the Conservative Party back you.”The move, which would cost the Treasury £1.05billion a year, will be funded by the 300,000 Britons who earn more than £150,000 a year.
Under an EU exemption, Maltese hunters are allowed 20 days to hunt turtle doves and quails between April and May, a time when the birds fly north to breed after wintering in Africa. Environmentalists have called repeatedly for the EU to ban the practice that they say endangers the species. The hunters argue that the autumn season is not enough and reject the environmentalists' argument. Polls have shown no clear majority for either camp.
Rebels have been fighting a low-intensity insurgency in the province for decades, demanding an end to what they see as the exploitation of their resources by people from other parts of Pakistan.The workers killed at a construction site 9 miles from the town of Turbat were mostly from outside Baluchistan which suggested the Baluch rebels were responsible, said provincial interior minister Akbar Hussain Durrani.Three wounded survivors said the gunmen opened fire on the sleeping men with automatic weapons, then escaped on motorcycles.
In or out? David Cameron has pledged a referendum on Europe - eventuallySunday People readers would just narrowly vote for Britain to stay in the EU if the referendum took place on polling day.Our People’s Panel split 43% for EU membership and 38% against if they had to make the decision on May 7.Each week the panel examines the key issues in the run-up to the General Election. And today we focus on our future in Europe.David Cameron plans to hold a referendum in 2017 if the Tories win in May.But only after renegotiating the terms of Britain’s EU membership with our European partners.Labour leader Ed Miliband has ruled out a referendum if he becomes PM because he says it would be a distraction from the real issues such as the NHS.Reader Dez Yelding, from Durham, told us: “Europe is good for Britain and to leave would be a disaster.”Nearly half of the panel agree the EU has helped to keep peace in ­Europe since the Second World War, which was the reason the original Common Market was set up.Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg says that withdrawal could put three ­million British jobs at risk.But four in ten of our People’s Panel think the Deputy PM is ­exaggerating – although another quarter are unsure.If the UK crashed out of ­Europe, one in five readers would favour forging closer trade links with the US instead.But 40% prefer to see more business with ­Commonwealth ­countries such as New Zealand, ­Australia and Canada.The European Convention on Human Rights is not so popular with our readers. Only 37% support it while 45% want to pull out.Reader Ann Pears, of Cambridge, said: “Criminals use the human rights act to get away with their crimes.”Withdrawal from the convention was the preferred option with 67% of Tory voters, rising to eight in ten for Ukippers, compared to 33% of Labour voters wishing to pull out.Reader Kaz, from Manchester, told us: ”The last thing we need is ­European judges telling us what we can and can’t do in our courts.”
In two short companion pieces, playwrights Geoffrey Atherden and Vanessa Bates tune in to echoes of the Gallipoli campaign and muse on the ways in which memories and myths are made, sustained and eroded over time.In Dear Mum and Dad, Atherden employs a variation on the "tin-box-under-the-bed" approach, as Holly (Anita Hegh) unearths letters from great grandfather Bert, wounded during the first Gallipoli landings. With the help of a nurse, the temporarily blinded Bert (Eric Beecroft) writes from a hospital ship en route to Lemnos. He's in a fever dream but is determined to write the truth. All he can get past the censors, however, are platitudes.Whether by design or accident, I don't know, but Bates' play, Light Begins to Fade, uses a similar time-slipping structure in its depiction of a quartet of modern day screenwriters jamming ideas for a Gallipoli centenary project. The creative cupboard appears bare until one seizes on a relic, a brass whistle dated 1915, used in the heat of battle. Or was it? But if it looks the part, does it matter?Written to a commission from the Ensemble, neither play offers strikingly original perspectives on the Gallipoli campaign or its mythic status. But each speaks quite effectively to the difficulties we have in maintaining a meaningful, let alone accurate, connection to the events of a century ago.Atherden's play is the more traditional, with chunks of expository dialogue making it feel like a play written for a high school audience. Light Begins to Fade is more artful and poetic, as Bates flips the audience between an airless writers' room, a Gallipoli landing boat and a modern day soccer mum watching her son from the sidelines.Mark Kilmurry's production is sparely furnished and solidly acted, though opportunities to dig deep are few. Hegh shines, as she almost always does, capably supported by Beecroft, Amy Mathews and David Terry, whose comic touch lights up whatever character he's playing – especially the dreadlocked ghoul from Turkish mythology who drops in for tea and scones with an Australian mother on the verge of losing both her sons to war.
CHARLIE Adam's magic dust has rubbed off on former Potter Jon Parkin.Parkin scored from near the half-way line for Forest Green Rovers in today's Vanarama Conference clash with play-off rivals Macclesfield Town.It was not quite as far out as Stoke midfielder Adam pulled off against Chelsea last weekend but it was still a mammoth effort.Parkin helped Stoke win promotion to the Premier League in 2008 after joining from Hull City.He is now playing under former Stoke coach Adrian Pennock and the win today lifts Forest Green up to fourth, with Macclesfield dropping to fifth.It was the 33-year-old's 23rd goal of the season and he has been in prolific form since Christmas as Rovers chase a place int he Football League.He has scored 16 times in 17 games with two matches remaining of the regular season.
Doctors at Lufthansa had recommended that pilot Andreas Lubitz, who is suspected of deliberately crashing a plane in the French Alps, be given psychological treatment after he suffered a bout of depression, a German newspaper reported.Citing documents found by Germany’s air transport authority, the Bild am Sonntag said the doctors wrote that “Lubitz should continue to receive psychological treatment, even though he was deemed fit to fly” by an independent expert in 2009.Lubitz had interrupted his flight training in 2009 and had told Lufthansa about his illness.The report does not specify if Lubitz had indeed benefited from continued treatment.A Lufthansa spokesman declined to comment when contacted by Bild.French investigators believe that Lubitz deliberately slammed the plane operated by Lufthansa subsidiary Germanwings into the French Alps on 24 March, killing all 150 people on board.Germany’s air transport authority said it never had access to Lubitz’s medical files, and was only able to examine them three days after the crash.German prosecutors have said Lubitz was diagnosed as suicidal “several years ago”, before he became a pilot, but had appeared more stable of late.Doctors had recently found no sign that he intended to hurt himself or others, but he was receiving treatment from neurologists and psychiatrists who had signed him off sick from work a number of times, including on the day of the crash.Police found torn-up sick notes during a search of his apartment after the crash.
Regular meditation could save your sanity during your next house move.Change is always challenging, and moving house can be a time of great stress for a lot of people.But meditation coach Tom Cronin, founder of the Stillness Project, says it doesn't have to be this way."No matter what the ocean is doing on the surface, whether it's whopping great eight-foot-high seas being whipped up by a wild storm, at the very depth of the ocean there's still stillness," Mr Cronin says.He recommends regular meditation leading up to a house move to keep a sense of consistency through a time of disruption."Cleaning the toilet doesn't give you the same level of serotonin and oxytocin released into your system than if you're cuddling by a log fire with someone you love. But what happens when we meditate for long periods of time is that we get this wonderful trickle of serotonin and oxytocin into our system. We transcend those barriers of separation where that action is going to lead to this experience or this response.""I'm feeling blissed out whether I'm packing a box or shifting a fridge or throwing away these ridiculous socks that I've had at the bottom of my socks drawer for the last 12 years of my life, so it doesn't really matter. You'll actually find it quite liberating."It can be a time when people feel less inclined to look after their bodies, citing a lack of time."They say 'I'm too stressed to meditate, I've got too much going on in my world today' but these sorts of wild fluctuations in life are when it's the most important for us to to just take time out, to pause and immerse yourself in the stillness."

The introduction of the card-reading machine by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) continued to raise lots of dusts, starting from its conception by the commission. The presidential and National Assembly elections were a testament to this. What does the future hold in store for the card reader and the nation’s electoral system? KEHINDE ADEGOKE queries.The use of card reading machine in Nigerian electoral process has become a highly-contentious issue, especially amongst the political class, such that Nigerians are asking if the card reading machine is a failure or success.In essence, there is a sharp divide amongst the exponents and the antagonists of this innovation. While the promoters strongly feel that card reader is the best thing for the country—as such will, to an extent, minimise electoral malpractices, boost the image of the country amongst the comity of nations and give Nigeria a credible election. The antagonists, however, feel, amongst other things, that Nigeria has not yet mature for such innovation. On its own, the ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) argued that in as much as they are not afraid of its usage, INEC must ensure that no Nigerian voter was disenfranchised by the machine.But who is jittery of card reader? Who is afraid of innovation? Who is afraid of change—say development? Why are certain political class nervous about the card reader? Could we possibly say that the last election has really justified the use of the system? Has it performed creditably? How could it be necessarily assessed? How could the Information Technology (IT) department of the INEC be rated, considering their past performance? What about the IT staff of the commission, could their staff strength be said to be sufficient enough?Again, going by the just concluded elections, could the use of the system be possibly continued? Has the INEC Chair, Prof. Attahiru Jega, really performed creditably well; how could he be possibly rated? What will happen to Jega in June? Who will succeed him? What are expectations of Nigerians from the incoming INEC chair?But a renowned telecoms engineer and consultant, Adedeji Sonuga, said the card reader, as it were, is the best thing that has happened to the Nigerian electoral process, adding it is a welcome idea, and a commendable innovation. He hinted that there was nothing particularly wrong with the card reader machines as wrongly speculated by politicians. He revealed that all the equipment was supposed to have been tested before being deployed to their various polling units for use.His words: “That’s the best thing we can have in Nigeria, which could even be upgraded but we don’t want to go into that .But in case of criminality, card reader will detect your biography, and with your finger print, you could easily be accessible, so we are supposed to start from somewhere. Unfortunately, INEC never envisaged that there could be problem, which is a lapse on INEC’s side, anyway. Why I said it’s a lapse on their side is because the cellophane in the faces of the card readers was supposed to have been removed in the first place, if all the card readers had been tested.“The fact that there was still cellophane in some of the card reader implied that not all of them have been tested before the election as we have something that we call workshop test, which means it has never be tested. Again, it was supposed to have been downloaded programmed. What they were doing is that they didn’t want to accept that not all the card readers have been tested. Had it being that they have all been tested, the cellophane wouldn’t have been on the faces of the card reader, that’s number one. Then, by saying it’s just like an ATM, we programme like radio whatever, all this programming was supposed to have been done in their office.“But tell me, how many IT-qualified persons are they having as staff, we are not talking of ad hoc staff, how many staff are on ground? If you look at their staff strength once they introduced the use of card reader for the election, at least, IT staff are supposed to be like 25 per cent because they are the ones to do all these jobs. They are the ones to do the programming; they are the ones to oversee these things and see that they are working perfectly before they are even being dispatched. So those are the lapses that I have seen with INEC but the advantage supersedes the disadvantage.”Similarly, a renowned environmentalist and President, Ecologistics Integrated Services Limited, Opebi Lagos, Dr Paul Abolo, told Newswatch Times last week that the politicians are against the use of Card Reader for accreditation because they want it to be business as usual. Abolo insisted that INEC was trying its very best and should be encouraged rather than being maliciously criticised.His words: “People have their different views about issues. We should consider where we are coming from. It’s quite unfortunate that nobody is commending INEC. Everybody is just saying that INEC is not doing this, INEC is not doing that, and if we look back, this is just a new process and it will take some time. If you ask me INEC is doing a good job. It’s doing well.“In the transformational time like this, you found out that it takes a lot of time to make things to be perfect. To make things perfect is a process. Even democracy itself is a process. INEC is working hard to build our democracy to a level where there will be credibility in our elections. And you don’t achieve this overnight, that’s why I said we should consider where we are coming form. They are trying, they are bringing new technology into the system.“I vote in America, and I can tell you that what the INEC is putting in place here, America does not have it. You go there with your ID, they check you out and they give you form to fill. What INEC is doing in Nigeria is because of the peculiarity of our situation. There, people know their rights and their democracy has stabilised. INEC has done its research, looked at the peculiarity of our situation in Nigeria and has come up with a solution, and designed project for same. Now, let me tell you something here, the politicians are strongly against the process because they want it to be business as usual. So all the issues they are having with INEC is that these people are coming to distort the process and the norms.“A situation where people realise that it is difficult to rig, they will be compelled to do the right thing. So the people are fighting with a system that would compel them to do the right thing. And people are talking about INEC being ready and INEC not being ready. February 14, the day of election, was not written in our constitution, somebody fixed that date and if it is no longer feasible, it can be moved as well, if it’s not moved beyond May 29. So our people are demanding for too much when actually they are not even doing enough. They are demanding for this and that, let them govern their families first and see how easy it is, let alone govern Nigeria.”In the same vein, in a recent interview with Newswatch Times, a senior pastor at the Lighted Church, Ikeja Lagos, Pastor Charles Ojei, said that whenever people fail to play the right politics or when they don’t have the right people in the right places, it will be difficult to get the governance right and one should consequently expect what is happening in Nigerian politics. “It is unfortunate, actually, because someone said few years that manipulation is part of politics. This is not, and should never be the attitudes of Nigerian politicians as it is not the right attitude.”Said he: “The ruling government should also be looking at how to address this problem—that is if they are not part of it anyway. The ruling government should be thinking of how to solve this problem; and the public should also begin to cry out whenever they suspect any sinister move by any party group, or individuals. They should stand their ground and say no to all this vices so that we do not just continue to sell our conscience and mortgage our destiny now and then.“Also, there should be public enlightenment to the effect. That’s the more reason I also believe in card reader because it will minimise all this sharp practices. For instance, if anybody steals a PVC, Card Reader will detect during biometrics capturing that the person is not the owner and the person is automatically disqualified. That is one of the major advantages of the machine.”Despite all the controversies surrounding the use of the equipment, the INEC is still confident about the performance of the tools as Prof. Jega has said that card reader will outstay him; as he has hinted that he would quit the service of the commission after yesterday’s elections.In his article: ‘Reading the Card Reader Issue,’ former Governor of Lagos State, and National Leader of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu, insisted that the claim that the use of the cards will disenfranchise voters is bogus. According to him, the world over, voters are required to register to vote and to present at the polling booth, on election day, a voter registration card. This process, according to him, is not materially different from what takes place in other nations.“Neither the card nor the reader itself is used to cast votes. The card is a form of identification, an important and effective method of internal control, verification and confirmation, affirming the voter is eligible to participate in this important civic exercise.“In the old system, the voter still had to present a voter registration card that would be verified by the appropriate electoral official. The verification process was porous and inaccurate, due in part to innocent human error and to wilful malpractice.“By making the verification process dependent on computer-read biometrics, the elements of human error and mischief have been eliminated from this important process. Fingerprints cannot be altered nor can the machine’s reading of them be distorted. Only those entitled to cast ballots will be allowed to receive a ballot to cast. I cannot understand how anyone with even the pretence of a democratic bone in his body can bemoan this improvement.“They cry that the card reading machines are imperfect. No one can guarantee that each and every machine will perfectly work. However, the alternative is fraught with even greater imprecision. Each national election conducted in Nigeria since 1999 has been a feat of ample rigging and malpractice. That is the way of the old system. It incentivises gross impropriety. This new way discourages, if not prevents it. Unless the card readers are being sabotaged by PDP agents, the possibility of a massive failure of the readers is so scant as to be statistically implausible. The rate of innocent human error inherent in the old system far exceeds that of computer error in the new one. When we add the high rate of wilful mischief and wrongdoing the old system condoned, the new digital path is vastly superior to the reversion the PDP would have us make,” Tinubu said.Earlier, Secretary to the Commission, Augusta Ogakwu, had announced in a statement that, “The Independent National Electoral Commission wishes to inform all Nigerians that Card Readers will be used for the April 11, 2015 Elections.”She added: “The provision of the Guidelines for the conduct of the 2015 General Elections, which outlined what is to be done if a Card Reader fails and cannot be replaced by the Commission within a specified time frame (i.e. Reschedule the election to the next day), will be enforced.“The relaxation of the Guideline on 28th March 2015 was only with respect to the Presidential and National Assembly elections held on that date.“The Commission has reviewed the operation of the Card Reader in the 28th March Elections, identified the challenges and has taken adequate measures to address them.”The card readers had malfunctioned in some parts of the country during the March 28 Presidential and National Assembly Elections, forcing the INEC to suspend its use in some polling units across the country.The commission later said after the elections that one of the reasons the card readers failed was because its officials failed to remove the protective film on the lens of the equipment. Some of the devices failed to read the biometric data of voters who turned up to perform their civic duties at various polling stations across the country.President Goodluck Jonathan was one of those unable to get accreditation with the electronic device when he showed up at his Unit 13 polling station in his hometown in Otuoke, Bayelsa State, to vote. For over half an hour, the electoral officials at the unit battled unsuccessfully to get the president accredited.Despite about four of the devices being deployed to ensure that the president and his wife were accredited, yet they ended up being accredited manually to vote during the exercise after being issued the INEC incidence form.But speaking on Sunday, March 29, on a television programme to review the conduct of the exercise, Kayode Idowu, the spokesperson to the INEC Chairman, Attahiru Jega, said the devices may have failed to function as a result of the non-removal of the protective film on their lenses.Meanwhile, the All Progressives Congress(APC) in Osun State, has described the antagonists of the electronic card readers for accreditation of voters as poll fraudsters. The Director of Publicity of APC in Osun State, Mr. Kunle Oyatomi, said this in a statement last week.The statement read, “Whatever the difficulties experienced during the presidential election with application of the card reader, experience gained from its use leaves us better off for the electoral process and the credibility of the exercise, than without the card reader.“Those who are now agitating that INEC should discontinue the use of the card reader are the losers at the last election, who want to recoup their losses, and gain from a fraudulent manipulation of the voting process which they have used in the last 16 years to stay in power.“We vehemently oppose the idea being suggested by some interested parties that INEC should not use the card reader for the governorship and Houses of Assembly elections. It will be defeatist for INEC, retrogressive for our emergent democracy and absolutely harmful to the credible electoral process which INEC is building.“INEC can, therefore, not trade off this significant milestone in its efforts to sanitise the electoral process which allowed spoilers a breathing space to cynically enjoy their crooked pastime of vote rigging.“This will not only damage the hard-earned esteem INEC has had since the March 28 presidential election, it will also disappoint Nigerians and the international community and endanger our democracy that has just emerged from the doldrums of its stagnated past.”Also, the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties, last Monday praised enthusiastically the verdict of the INEC for insisting on the use of the card reader for the April 11 governorship and houses of assembly elections. National Publicity Secretary of the CNPP, Osita Okechukwu, said this in Abuja, last week.His words: “It is our considered view that Card Reader is an antidote to ballot box stuffing, ballot box snatching and padding of votes; hence ultimate reduction of electoral malpractices and all manner of irregularities.“On this count, we call on our member political parties to instruct their candidates to place the collective interest of our dear nation above personal political survival by using and relying only on the Card Reader.“Accordingly, CNPP calls on INEC as a matter of urgent national importance to rectify and take adequate measures to plug all the identified challenges and malfunctions of the Card Reader device, which featured on the 28th March 2015 presidential and National Assembly elections.”
To flee your fate is to rush to find it, so observes a famous Arab proverb. It is just as well. Ethnic termites are crawling out of the woodwork in Nigeria. In the hostile psychological jungle of multi-ethnic nations, ethnic chauvinism is a psychic weapon against adversity. But since it stifles the inter-ethnic cooperation and collaboration necessary for envisioning a new order, it is also the surest formula for continuing underdevelopment.After the elections comes the demon of ethnic chauvinism and its implications for the national project. The euphoria of a record breaking election and its record breaking aftermath had hardly subsided when a nasty ghost stole in to jolt us out of our reverie, reminding us of unfinished business. These old ghosts can be very remorseless and implacable indeed.An apparently off the cuff remark by Oba Rilwan Akiolu, the influential and irrepressible Eleko himself, to a visiting group of Igbo notables has sparked off an ethnic firefight the like of which has not been seen in recent times.  In a manner reminiscent of Lagos circa 1948 when the deadly duel for political ascendancy between the Yoruba coastal aristocracy and the emergent Igbo elite first reared its ugly head, the current elites of the two remarkable Nigerian ethnic nationalities both at home and in the Diaspora simply lined up behind tribal ensigns presaging the eruption of ancestral animosities. It was not a pretty sight. General Buhari has just been shown a sneak preview of the nation he has inherited. He has his work cut out for him.Yet by the end of the week, it has apparently turned out to be a storm in a tea cup, or a repression of the returning. Common sense and political sagacity intervened on both sides. The problem with ethnic chauvinism is that it is such a deep-seated and entrenched group feel that it cannot be resolved by political fiat but by social engineering and the working out of implacable national contradictions.Anybody of Yoruba extraction familiar with royal rhetorical flights of fancy, its metaphorical flourishes should be able to contextualize Oba Akiolu’s fire and brimstone fulminations in all their grim, terroristic hectoring as nothing but instances of royal yabis. How many military divisions does Kabiyesi have? When was the last time an Oba of Lagos herded human beings into the Lagos lagoon?All of this, of course, would amount to cold comfort to an Igbo native who is culturally alien to Oba Akiolu’s flamboyant signifiers and who is bound to grasp the import of the message in its hair raising, horror-dripping literalness. You cannot blame such folks. The Igbo community is right to express a legitimate outrage.But it would seem that some Igbo sectors in spite of their legitimate outrage crossed the boundary into churlishness and tribal contumely by demanding an apology from the Oba of Lagos. This is an illegitimate affront on the Yoruba race. A Yoruba Oba does not apologise to anybody. This is the whole meaning of Kabiyesi. (He who cannot be queried or questioned)It is, admittedly, a dialogue of the deaf. To a non-Yoruba person, this might sound like some meaningless cultural gobbledygook; a dogged mystification of a profoundly secular matter. It seems we are back to the very constitution and contradictions of the post-colonial subject in a modern nation-state. The secular and rational plank on which an apology is demanded from the Oba of Lagos is that Nigerian is a republican state and not a monarchy. Yoruba nationalists might retort that Nigeria may be a republican state but there are monarchical enclaves within the nation-space and there is nothing anybody can do about that.In pre-colonial society, the Oba had a fatherly responsibility to all subjects under his domain. Everybody was free to ply his trade, religion and creed but with the signal proviso that there must be substantial compliance with the cultural ethos and ethics of the host community in order to maintain societal harmony and cohesion. Whosoever steps out of line is immediately whipped back either by physical force or by metaphysical agencies and enforcers acting as ideological apparatchiks of the native state.Some traditional cultures take this to another level by summarily banishing prospective settlers to the outer margins beyond the city walls. In their culturally circumscribed imaginary, these are nothing but citadels of sin and permissiveness where they can indulge in what looks to the indigenes as cultural shenanigans as long as they do not disturb the walled sanity of their host community. If they do, the infraction is met with swift and severe reprisal that did not exclude mass expulsion.The advent of colonialism and the modern nation-state has whittled down the power, influence and authority of traditional institutions. In truth, no one who has tasted the liberating tonic of modernity would wish to return to the dark days of traditional despotism. Yet that notwithstanding, the Yoruba people and most Nigerian nationalities  retain a great respect and reverence for their traditional rulers.The unintended consequence of the sacrilegious insult to the Lagos throne is to rouse a dormant Lagosian Yoruba ultra-nationalism in a way it has not been roused since the late forties. It has led to a sense of a great siege among a normally tolerant and accommodating people. Apart from the long term possibilities of ethnic tension leading to an unimaginably apocalyptic tribal conflagration, snooper will eat his tongue if this does not increase the size of Akin Ambode’s winning margin this Saturday.In a multi-ethnic nation, tribal narcissism often provokes tribal narcissism as a countervailing, self-protecting measure. As it was the case in Georgian Lagos which directly led to the ascendancy of Obafemi Awolowo as an avatar of his people and in 1966 when it led to pogrom and a civil war, so it may well be in the emergent conjuncture. The past is a dark mirror for remembering the future.Yet all of this would have been unnecessary had the enlightened Igbo community put on their thinking cap, and if their political leadership can be more politically discerning and be less consumed by irrational hatred of the Other. The history of human migration and shifting demographic complexion of an improbable megalopolis favour them in the long run.In about a hundred years to come, the dynamics of a tumultuous mega-city would have altered the current demographic balance of power and the kind of meeting which took place last week at the Lagos palace would be virtually impossible. If the dynamic, resourceful, adventurous and relentlessly advancing Igbo people continue along the same pattern and the Yoruba populace, as a result of empire hangover, remain lethargic, incurious, insular and unadventurous, the pattern of ownership and land distribution would have changed forever and it will be a new ball game.But that is only if Nigeria remains a single country retaining its current format; that is only if unscrupulous greed and the penchant for political short-termism among the current dominant faction of the Igbo leadership do not topple the country into the abyss of chaos and disintegration. To whom much will be given, much is also expected. Otherwise by that time, we would be talking of stiff immigration control and tighter internal regulation of prospective emigrants.From time immemorial and particularly since the advent of the post-Wesphalian modern nation-state, ethno-nationalism and ethnic chauvinism have been the bane of the human society. The British often dismiss the French as frog-eaters while Napoleon famous put down of England as a nation of shopkeepers still rings a bell. The French contempt for what they consider as America’s lack of culture and finesse finds epic summation in the short pithy putdown: “Les Americaines!”The good thing about this European tribal fencing is that they take place within the confines of respected borders. The world would have ended a long time ago were the British, the Germans, the French and the Americans to be packed into the asphyxiating cage of the same nation. Even then beginning from 1870 when the Germans memorably drubbed the sophisticated French to 1914 when the First World War erupted with the murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand by a Serbian nationalist in Sarajevo, western nations chalked up among themselves about thirty one wars of ethno-national supremacy.African , Middle East and Asian nationalities are not so lucky having been boxed into convenient colonial cages of apocalyptic contraries against their will and wish. This is not even a question of strong states and weak states. As we have seen in the tragedy of Yugoslavia and the former Soviet Union, strong states which try to liquidate the national question by forcible suppression merely postpone the apocalyptic meltdown.It has been said that mankind is principally a political animal. But humankind is primarily a homo economicus with economic warfare often disguised as political hostilities. Nigerians should ask themselves why it is so that the most vicious and virulent strains of ethnic nationalism rear their head whenever there is an ongoing brutal contention about who controls what economy.This is precisely what happened around 1948 with the advent of Yoruba nationalism in the nascent nation, in 1962 with the attempted take over of the buoyant economy of the old west and the summary liquidation of Awolowo’s ambition, in 1993 with the dramatic annulment of Abiola’s victory because it was an economic threat to northern plutocratic generals, in 1999 with the rise of Obasanjo and Sharia as mere decoy and now in 2015 and the dramatic dethronement of the ruling party which has led the Igbo political elite holding the wrong end of the stick. It can now be seen in immediate retrospect that Oba Akiolu’s fatwa and the hysterical reaction to it is all part of a complex struggle for economic control of Lagos.Yet as we have noted, without inter-ethnic cooperation and collaboration, without the consent and consensus of a fractious political elite, Nigeria cannot be envisioned anew or be made amenable to radical surgery and major re-engineering necessary for the greater wellbeing of the greatest majority of Nigerians.As we have said last week, General Buhari has his work cut out for him. The task ahead requires not just a strong political will but exemplary political skills and great dexterity. He can no longer rule by military fiat and therefore a creative and proactive presidency is mandatory. As a first step, the general must take a look at the current structural configuration of the country which has made it impossible to liberate the complementary genius of our various people or for power to be wielded for productive purposes.
There is a common misconception that exercise is intended only for those people who seek to lose weight. Nothing can be farther from the truth.Exercise performed on a routine basis has many health benefits far in excess of the narrow goal of losing weight alone. It is one of the most certain ways of keeping the body in shape and of maintaining a healthy metabolic rate. It also acts as an antidote to certain conditions like the metabolic syndrome which would manifest without it or worsen in the absence of it, like undue weight gain.It is precisely because of the benefits that our forebears were so fit. In their days, life was not automated and there were no machines to help with the ordinary business of life which was to provide food, shelter and clothing. Everything was done by hand and the farmland was frequently many kilometres away from the village. The average youth and adult were fit as a matter of necessity. It is speculated today that each succeeding generation is 50 per cent less fit that the previous one. It is as dire as that.And it is not a coincidence that this is happening. Across the world, increasing affluence has led to conspicuous consumption of food and drink. The world of electronic gadgets and 24-hour television and other forms of entertainment have meant a more sedentary lifestyle. There is less incentive to go outdoors in a world of increasing urbanisation and violent crime. Many people now live in a cocoon and we are the worse for it. Food is consumed on the move, everyone is in a hurry to meet some target, sleep is denied and the result is an expanding waistline around the world. It may not be possible to reverse some of the damage already caused; for instance, those who have developed diabetes as a result of all the above are now hobbled with a disease condition that has no cure.The benefits of not tending that conventional line are therefore quite immense. Regular exercise helps to keep the sinewy disposition of the muscles. They thus retain their strength and help keep excess fat away. They retain their bulk as well and perform their statutory functions of aiding mobility and providing protection to the underlying soft tissues. It is only when the muscles remain like this that they contribute to the maintenance of good health. It is perhaps key today to ensuring a healthy lifestyle. The benefits are immense and the reduction potentially, in the sums of money spent on the treatment of the resulting conditions to both individual and corporate purses are beyond quantification. In an already impoverished society such as ours, the potential savings are simply huge.Besides keeping in shape, exercise on a regular basis, also helps to rein in the amount of low density cholesterol in the system. Low density cholesterol is known to clog the arteries of the heart and the brain causing a progressing narrowing of those vessels that could lead to a heart attack or a stroke respectively. The precise way in which this is accomplished is not clear but there is a predominance of the high density type of cholesterol which is conversely said to prevent the development of the deadly sequence of events outlined above. With the preponderance of the high density cholesterol is a decline in the ability of calcium to attach to the innermost lining of the wall of those vessels. The protective cycle of this particular type of cholesterol is thus complete.Exercise also gives us a general “feel good” attitude that makes us appreciate things better. There is a natural, confident spring in the step and the development of a “can do” attitude. Things such as rest would then come naturally as does sleep. There is also a decline in the amount of food consumed because of a complex regulation of the urge to eat from the within the abdomen itself. There is a mobilisation of free fatty acids into certain vessels within the abdomen called the lacteal vessels in the course of exercising that act to diminish to urge to eat for several hours afterwards. Hunger is felt less and the overall tendency to weight loss is thus perhaps due in part to this unique property. The other benefit is the direct loss of calories from the effort of the exercise. It is the gain of twin benefits for the price of one.Within the tissues, about 25 per cent of all the tiny vessels that make up the microcirculation are usually closed off during normal activity. It is a huge bed of vessels but these open up in the course of exercising and nourish the cells at this level of the tissues in a very fundamental way. Toxins are also effectively removed from this level and the cells are thus renewed at those moments with less potential for cell and tissue damage. The production of certain natural pain killers during such exercises, called endorphins, also aids the feeling of well-being experienced by many people. With all these additional gains is the self-confidence that simply flows from such folks. They look healthy and fit and there is a tendency to want to keep looking like that. The increased blood flow through various organs especially the brain, kidneys, heart and muscles is especially refreshing.These benefits are mostly experienced by people who engage in regular exercise. This is described as exercise occurring about three times a week for a half hour or more per session. It must be sufficient to cause the heart to race and to break out in a sweat. A good physical state is compatible with the return to a normal steady heart rhythm some 30 minutes or so after the exercise has been concluded. These regular exercises can include such common sports as cycling, swimming or playing indoor games like table-tennis and squash. There are other sports to be sure which include badminton, volley ball and basketball. A brisk walk around the neighbourhood is similarly useful and the women tend to prefer that. The spectacle we see in many towns and cities across the nation when youths and young men gather to play informal football matches in any available open space is part of this. What is interesting about that is that men appear to be more conscious of the need to keep fit and healthy than women are. The females generally tend to prefer the gymnasiums where there is less fun in performing similar exercises and the tendency, therefore, is to exercise less overall.The people who take to sport as a profession do a lot more than what is described above. The exertion is often extreme and the various organs are consequently pushed to the limit. These sportsmen and women remain in peak physical condition and their resting metabolic rates are significantly higher than is normal for the general population. Their heart rate is also significantly lower than what you and I may have. The need for calories is similarly higher. This is not the group of people being referred to in this essay. Rather, it is directed at those very ordinary people like you and I who wish to stay healthy as a matter of course. Regular exercise is a passport to longer life. It is a key to better sexual performance among men. It is a sure way to keep the weight under check. It is an important help to the cycle of waking and sleeping and is crucial to the maintenance of our memory. It is a massive help in burning excess calories and in preventing plaques from developing within the blood vessels. It may therefore have useful implications in the prevention of heart disease and strokes that are not due to high blood pressure.The habit of engaging in exercises can be made a vocation. It is better and more fun when several people are engaged in it in a group format so that it does not become tedious. It is certain to be enjoyable in that particular scenario and the added benefits are immense. We have of recent seen a septuagenarian former president playing football, a centenarian in Japan swimming 100 metres in an Olympic size pool and a sitting American president playing golf. All these tell us that there is something positive in exercising.Dear doctor, I am a 26-year-old lady. I have this intermittent breast pain. There is no redness or swelling. It’s just the pain and I am not sexually active. What is the cause? 070426xxxxxThere is no way I can determine what the cause is without performing an examination. You need to see a doctor for such an examination and he/she may ask you to do an ultrasound scan of the breast if they have reason to worry or there is a lump felt within it. Do so as soon as possible. It may be nothing but that can only be determined following an examination.Dear doctor, I am male and I use a roll-on in my private area. Please, is this a good thing to do? 080825xxxxxIt is an antiperspirant. There is no harm in deploying it the way you have done. It is actually a good habit.Dear doctor, I am an ardent reader of your column. I’m 66 years old, a diabetic and hypertensive (for the past 12 years) but well controlled. Some three years ago, I started having blood running from my left nostril. It will come may be two-three times a week. The hospital prescribed some drugs and nasal spray which stopped it. I was also told to stop the daily intake of vasoprin which I have been taking for the past 10 years. The last examination I did few weeks ago read thus:There is mucosal thickening of the right ethmoidal and left maxillary sinuses. A soft tissue density is also seen arising from the medial wall and projecting into the cavity likely due to a follicle. Near total opacification of the ethmoidal and maxillary sinuses is noted. There is engorgment of the inferior nasal turbinates. Dental filling is noted in the upper premolar and there is a loss of some of the upper and lower incisor teeth noted.After reading your article about Nose Bleeding in SUNDAY PUNCH, I decided to write to you to know your take on this report as I’m scared of surgery. I have been placed on drugs and nasal spray as usual and it has again stopped. Thank you and have a blessed Easter. alxxxx@xxxx.comWe discussed all those causes in that article. Whatever your ENT surgeon determines to be best for you is what you should do because he is the one managing your condition. It is typical to want to try some of the treatment options that you have had before considering an operation. If the offending polyp does not regress with the current therapy, it would be wise to have the surgery to remove it. That particular process is not a major operation and it can be safely done for you in less than one hour.Dear doctor, kudos to you for the wonderful column you write every week. I have already been blessed through your articles, please continue with your research and good work. God will surely reward you sir. Stay lifted. oluxxxx@xxxx.comAmen and thank you very much for your kind words.Dear doctor, I’m 22 years old with a strange growth around my vagina. They are long, looking like tiny fingers. Sometimes, they itch, and when I scratch it, some of these fleshy things come off with bleeding. What can this possibly be and how do I get it treated?                                               080528xxxxxI believe you may be describing genital warts. You should see your doctor for a confirmation and get it treated. There are various lotions for the treatment of this condition.Dear doctor, I am 28 years old, recently married for about five months now. I have been having very regular sex with my husband, but I am surprised that I have not even had a delayed period for one day. Is this something I should worry about?                                                 080344xxxxxIt’s still too soon to worry unduly. However, it may be wise to have your husband do a semen analysis to be certain that he is alright. Whatever result is obtained from that will determine what next should be done.Dear doctor, I am a regular reader of your column. I want to thank you for the way you have made many of us to come out of our shells and openly share our problems. The other aspect is that we sometimes know beforehand which type of specialist we should consult. This is very good. My problem is that of quick ejaculation. I seldom last for two minutes. This is very embarrassing and not good enough in my view at only 32 years of age. What should I do please?                                                       080530xxxxxThank you so much. It is a burden you can shed by visiting a sex therapist and also a urologist who will examine you so as to determine that your organ is normal and can thus function normally. Consequent upon that, he may choose to place you on a suitable medication to treat your condition.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Mass importation and counterfeiting of imported goods into Nigeria has made nonsense of the country’s quest for quality goods and  industralisation. However, experts have suggested that the way to go is to develop high standards through effective supervision by the Standard Organisation of Nigeria (SON) via the  Small and Medium scale Enterprises. In this write-up William Anaebonam posits that it will be more appropriate to institute standards through SME’s.For a good number of exports the best way to approach nationwide standardization is to target small and medium companies who constituted about 90 per cent of companies on the average in every given nation. And for those with this perspective this may well be the only way for the Standard Organization of Nigeria (SON) to succeed effortlessly in its war against the production and consumption of sub-standard products in the country.Writing in Focus Magazine Elizabert Denis posited that SME’ s are very crucial because they promote diversification of economic activities, support sustainable development, stimulate innovation and develop entrepreneurial skills, while contributing significantly to exports and trade.SON is obviously aware of the capacity of SME’s hence it many months ago decided to upgrade its small and medium enterprises (SME) unit to a full fledged department. The Director General/Chief Executive Officer of the organization Dr. Joseph Odomodu who said this at a Small Business Opportunity fair 2013 in Port Harcourt described small and medium enterprises (SME) as the engine room of the economy. He said when upgraded the department would act as a centre of excellence.The Standards Organization of Nigeria has since then also pledged to carry out the certification of products of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for free. Delivering an address: “Made in Nigeria For the World – a Transformational Imperative,” Odumodu maintained that inspite of the fact there are well over 20,000 registered SMEs in the country, most products in the country cannot compete favourably in the global market due to non-conformity to standards. He posited that for Nigeria to attain its20, 2020 goal, products must be able to compete favourably at the world stage, stressing that the future of Nigerian trade lies with indigenous firms(which are mainly SME’s).He disclosed that Upgrading Nigerian SME’s to produce world standard products is one of President Jonathan’s priorities. To achieve this, according to him Mr President has assured an enabling environment is created to give Nigerian products the recognition they need to compete internationally.As noted in the current focus magazine”Small business is – quite frankly – big business. It is estimated that more than 90 per cent of the world’s businesses are SMEs. Surprised? Don’t be. SMEs are, on average, the businesses that are generating growth, creating jobs, growing faster and innovating more. But most of all, they are a good deal less complicated (structurally) and therefore can be more efficient and flexible than are large firms.“Providing effective small-business support should be a keystone of any economy and helping them reap the benefits of using standards should be one of the focus areas. It will require new ways of working together across public and private sectors and openness to innovative ideas and models. Crucially, though, it implies taking into account the best practices already serving small businesses around the world. And there are some great examples featured in this issue!One can easily understand that “International Standards are one of the building blocks that help enterprises of all shapes and sizes to work more efficiently, increase productivity and access new markets, while vitalizing and strengthening the economy.”That is why SON has been making effort to reach SME’s but the views of some school of thought is that enough effort has not been made in this direction. But the truth is that a lot has been achieved.Sometime ago SON certified 32 more Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in partnership with the Commonwealth Secretariat. That effort increase the number of SMEs with Quality certification in the country by 300 per cent from 10 presently to 42.At the event SON’s Head of SME Development and International Trade, Dr. Rob Okiyi, was quoted to have stressed that the agency hold’s that SMEs undergoes tremendous pressure in their development and move from the informal to the formal sector of the economy and that the only way to achieve that transition efficiency was to install some basic requirements such as quality management systems.However this cannot be done if the SME’s are not known. Hence the drive to enhance their registration.In an effort aimed at ensuring that locally made goods meet minimum quality standards, the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON) has continually appealed to them to register their products with the agency.Speaking on the issue Joseph Ugboaja, head, SON, Abia State, told a daily in a media chat in Aba, that manufacturers and small scale industrialists who decline product registration ,do so not because of its high cost, but as a result of the fear that they may not meet the required standards.According to him: “The evidence of the cheapness of the process is seen in the ease at which even bakers pass through it,” he said.However, He “warned that SON will not lower the standards for any manufacturer, noting that those who are determined to cut corners are those who refuse to present their products for standards tests and registration.”Many Stakeholders in the SMEs sector of the economy continue to express their worries that the influx of substandard products in the country has been the bane of development of the sub-sector. they hold that this has hindered sector which is estimated to account for over 90per cent of the manufacturing sector in Nigeria.Most believe that with an estimated 22 million SMEs in Nigeria,that our economic growth will largely depend on the SME’s.More worrisome is the case of electricity generators over which SON has issued many warnings.The generators failed short circuit tests; most generators in the markets have very high level noise levels, including many so called sound-proof generators, a high rate of non-functioning oil levels switch. It was also discovered that many high capacity generators overheat at about 80 percent load of maximum declared capacity, and there is high level of counterfeiting of genuine and known brands of generators was discovered including general low quality of winding wire for the coils in generators. It was also discovered that the life cycle of generators in the market is usually less than expected thereby creating electronic –waste in the environment with its attendant health and environmental hazards.“In view of the above findings, SON have called this meeting to inform you that all generators coming into the country must be rated in accordance with Nigeria Industrial Standards. Unregistered importers of generators and assemblers must ensure registration of their products not later than one month from today, while those with old registration must renew their registration within one month,” he said.He warned that all generators offered for sale in Nigeria must be properly rated in accordance with specifications in the applicable standards, stressing: “all generators offered for sale in Nigeria must meet the required sound levels in the applicable standards; that all imported and locally assembled power generators must meet the specifications in the applicable Nigeria Industrial Standards; importers of substandard generators will henceforth be prosecuted in addition to having their consignments seized.”He further charged the stakeholders, saying: Don’t import all your life. Set targets, say, for instance, in three years time, I will stop importing and start assembling. To become one of the top 20 economies by 2020, Nigeria should stop buying foreign products, and start selling to the world.”“As a matter of fact, we should be talking about generator manufacture at this stage of our development and not wholesale importation. One way to start is by ensuring the quality and durability of the ones which we have no option as at now, but sell.SON is ready to render the required support to operators in this sector who desire genuinely to raise their trades in accordance with quality standards. A sanitized generators imports and assemblage sector is in the best interest of us as dealers and our country, Nigeria.”Registration and re-registration, he said is to enable the Agency to create a robust data bank of genuine stakeholders in the sub sector. And they will be using the data bank to check import lists. Importers should obtain Nigeria’s Standards for generator and make it available to their manufacturers abroad so that none will claim ignorance.“We are very serious with what we are saying; please keep to the law. We need to clean up the system,” said Odumodu.In their responses, the stakeholders collectively cried out that they are not responsible for the influx of substandard generators in the system.In his submission, Mr. Chris Igbokwe, who represented Grand Products Nigeria Ltd; noted that failure for compliance was due to lapses on the part of SON.He said that dealers have the problem of getting Chinese manufacturers to comply with Nigeria Industrial Standards.Corroborating, the representative of Citizens International, asked SON to protect Nigerian dealers, noting that even though they give the standards to Chinese manufacturers, but they don’t comply. SON, he said, should go beyond certifying importers, and strengthening inspection from China.The National President, Nigerian Association of Small Scale Industrialists (NASSI), Mr. Chuku Wachuku, was of the view that once “ made in Nigeria products “meet global standards, there would be change in our economic fortunes.But for Director General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dr. Paul Orhii, we also need to fight fake and counterfeit drugs and other such products to save our economy. A lecturer at Ajayi Crowther University, Oyo, Mr. Israel Fatoki, believes that counterfeiting and substandard products had forced many multinationals out of the country.“Where is Dunlop? Where is Michelin? They have both left the country because of the influx of substandard products. These two companies found that substandard products made them uncompetitive and they had to relocate to other places where they could thrive. The same thing happened to many other companies. Just imagine the number of job opportunities that had been lost as a result of substandard products. Counterfeiting and substandard “, he said
Chineme, one of the daughters of a former governor of Anambra State, Chukwuemeka Ezeife, talks about her father’s political career with MOTUNRAYO JOELTell us about yourself.My name is Chineme Ezeife, I’m a 500 Level Law student of the Faculty of Law, University of Lagos. I will describe myself as someone who aspires to inspire. I hope to become a Senior Advocate of Nigeria in the nearest future. I have 14 siblings; I come from a polygamous home. My father has three wives. I am the 12th child.How was it growing up with your father?It was great. My father is a disciplinarian to the core, and he always made sure we did what was right. Aside from that, I had a normal childhood. I still remember my school days; whenever we got home from school, he would make us read our books. He didn’t allow us waste time playing around.Coming from a polygamous home was your childhood different?My childhood was beautiful; my father sees family bonding as something of importance. He doesn’t joke with his family. He ensured that we all grew up in the same house, we ate the same food and went to the same school. We are all very close, despite our large number. I speak to step sisters and brothers regularly.How do people react when they hear your surname?People are always surprised, but I always get positive reactions from them. Whenever they see my surname, they ask if I’m his daughter and when I say yes, they become surprised. I get so much help here and there. However, my father raised us up to be independent. He doesn’t write his name on any letter he gives us; he says we should strive to make a name for ourselves. I have enjoyed many privileges being his daughter.What are some of these?They are numerous. I had my secondary education in the East and he insisted on us learning our language. Over there, he is well known; they see him as incorruptible and someone that says his mind. Because of these qualities, people always wanted to help us and they even offered to go an extra mile in helping. I’m really grateful for that.Can you remember your most memorable moment growing up?There are many memorable moments; my father is a super dad. Every day is memorable.How did he discipline his children whenever they erred?My father never spared the rod, he used to flog us. He would ask us to bring a cane that is our height and he used it on us. But now, he corrects us verbally. He is a man of few words; if anyone of us misbehaved, he would tell us exactly what we have done wrong. He uses words and expression to chastise us.It is one of understanding, mutual respect and trust.How does he handle misunderstanding with your mother?He is a politician who knows how to calm things down.Does he advise you on the type of man to marry?Yes, he regularly does. He always tells us to think with our head and not our eyes. He says we should use our brain when it comes to marriage. He tells us not to marry a dream killer; instead we should marry someone that would strengthen our dreams.Are there times when your family feels scared for his life, being a politician?Yes, so many times. He is considered controversial, which I don’t think he is, but people see him that way. He is someone that speaks his mind. There are times when he writes articles and I become scared for his life. Some of his write-ups on Boko Haram and sectionalisation are straight to the point. I’m always praying to God to protect him. During the National Confab, I received a text that there was a bomb blast in Abuja, I became so scared.Did he influence the career choices of his children or encourage them to go into politics?No, he didn’t. He believes a child should follow his or her dreams. He believes in the independence of mind, will and action. He never pushes us to do anything, he only mentors and advises us on how to achieve our goals. He doesn’t encourage us to go into politics, though a few of us have decided to go into politics. But that is our personal decision. For example, I am interested in going into politics in my latter years. We have different professions in my family — lawyers, accountants, engineers and others.What did your father say motivated him to join politics?My father is a social democrat, an economist, and prior to his political career, he always wanted to make a difference and move things forward.

Majority of our leaders are guilty of corruption. Only a few is incorruptible and he says he is among the few. He hopes Nigeria becomes a better place.What are his views about the 2015 elections and where does his allegiance lie?All through the elections, he had supported President Jonathan’s brand, he wanted a continuity of progress, but it is God’s will for Gen. Muhammadu Buhari (retd.) to take over. We can now fold our hands and wait for the ‘promised change’ and we pray it comes to pass. Generally, he thinks the election was free and fair and that the results are God’s will. We really thank God for the success of the elections.Who did he support during the presidential elections?What values have you imbibed from him?Hard work and diligence, my father is a hard worker. He tells us that when he was having his Ordinary National Diploma, he taught himself at home and, read alone. That was how he managed to pass and gained admission to the university. He teaches us that there is no barrier to one’s success. I have also learnt honesty from him.What is it that Nigerians don’t know about him?My father is funny, he likes cracking jokes. He also likes to laugh; there is no boring moment with him. He reads a lot and he still goes jogging every morning.Does he read what people write about him?Yes, he does, regularly.How does he handle criticisms?He handles it really well.

He doesn’t spend extravagantly.What are his views about religion and ethnic divisions in the country?He sees division as a natural issue but he says divisions from different sects are perpetrated by ignorant people that need to be educated. He believes in unity despite our diverse religions.What does he have to say about President Goodluck’s tenure?He thinks President Jonathan made progress. Even though whatever he did were impeded by insurgency, it was hard for President Jonathan to do more.

But he desires to be part of the proposed change.Does he believe the President-elect, Gen. Buhari can bring about the change?I don’t know his view on that but he says Gen. Buhari’s victory is the will of God. We all pray things work out well.What are his hobbies?He likes reading. He likes watching television, and playing chess.What kind of books does your father read?He reads widely. He even has a few law books in his shelf; he reads books on history, career, and economics.What is your dad’s favourite food?He likes pounded yam with egusi soup mixed with okro.Describe your father’s tenure and achievement as a governor?When my father was governor of Anambra State in 1992, he had many plans for the state but his tenure was disrupted by the military. He said he had so many plans for Anambra State. He wanted to develop the place, but he wasn’t able to achieve them. Despite that, some of his achievements were the conversion of Nnamdi Azikiwe University and Federal Polytechnic, Oko.What is his favourite drink?He doesn’t have any in particular, but he eats quail eggs every morning.How sociable is he?He is a private person, he doesn’t really like going out.

It is a blessing. He is a great father; he sacrifices a lot just in order for us to be comfortable.What are some of his weaknesses and strengths?He is disciplined, he doesn’t cut corners. For his weakness, my father is easily moved, if he sees his neighbour going through one form of challenge, he is touched. His looks cover this, but my father can be sensitive.Does he ever regret going into politics?How is your mother handling his political career?She has handled it well. She has grown with his career.What is the first thing he does when he wakes and the last thing he does before he sleeps?He reads a book and that is the last thing he does before he sleeps. He also prays.He wakes up at 4am to read a book, goes power-walking or jogging, and then when he gets home, he reads newspapers. He also travels a lot.Your father must feel disappointed with the Boko Haram insurgency in the northYes, he is hurt. To him, Boko Haram was set up by people who wanted to make Jonathan’s government ungovernable.Did he share with you his views on how the insurgency can be curbed?He thinks insurgency has already being dealt with because he feels some forces are behind it. The people behind it wanted power to come into their hands.What do you think should be his legacy?I think posterity will remember him for his integrity, honesty and truthful nature.What don’t you like about him?He is a disciplinarian to the core; he doesn’t leave room for misbehaviour. If he tells any child to do something and he or she refuses, he tags the person as being irresponsible. He stands on his ground, which I like about him.What else have you imbibed from him?Family bonding, he still takes everyone to the village every Christmas.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

The setting was ideal, so was the time. It was morning in Daura, Katsina State, and General Muhammadu Buhari’s hometown. The sun was readying itself to rise, with an eye peering through the greyish northern sky to spy on the earth beneath.My contact had warned me to be there before dawn and, like an ambusher, lie in wait for the general to be up to do his morning ablution and prayers. “He’s an early riser,” he had told me. But he knows you are around and would attend to you, ‘briefly,’ he had said, since you have come from far away land and have been here for two days already. But you must be here before the loving masses start to amass. For, then, it would be over. And he will be off to Kaduna today.”When finally at about 6 am the lanky general sauntered into the lounge, he had a warm smile across his face, a bright white set of teeth breaking through the lightly ajar lips. The thought of how this mimics the rising sun crossed my mind. But this is no time for idle reverie.“Hello, Tunde,” the general said, “hope the vigil has not been too long.” He smiled.MB: “Thank you, thank you, but the victory is everyone’s, and yours, or you didn’t vote for me?”MB: “Then congratulations to you too. In another 15 minutes we shall be mobbed. So you are well advised to be quick with your questions,”TF: “Sir, fourth time lucky. Did you at any time truly believe that this day will come, that Nigerians will finally come round to voting you in as their president?”MB: I never do anything if I don’t have the conviction that it is possible, if I give it my best. My policy is never to give up — on anything: people, the country, desire, anything. If I don’t achieve the result I aim for, it should never be for want of trying.”TF: “But you gave up in 2011, literally, after your third attempt and being rejected by Nigerians.”MB: (Cuts in) “If I ‘gave up’ as you said, I wouldn’t have allowed myself to be persuaded to run again. And, I believe I was not ‘rejected by Nigerians’ as you put it. If I thought I was truly rejected by the majority of Nigerians and that I lost fairly, I wouldn’t have gone through the trouble of challenging the result in the tribunal. Be that as it may, that is behind us now.”TF: “Many Nigerians, sir, even those who hate you…”TF: “Sorry, sir, even those who are against you, recognise certain admirable qualities in you from the experience of your time as military Head of State, to which perseverance has now been added. One of them is my friend Lawson Omokhodion who held an unshaken belief that only a Buhari can save Nigeria.“In one of my columns in August last year titled, ‘Examining the Buhari Option,’ I despaired on the prospect of the ‘Buhari Option’ (BO). If I may explain sir, the BO is a romantic notion of a Gen Buhari coming to clear the deck of corruption and indiscipline in Nigeria, a la Jerry Rawlings in Ghana, spearheading a ‘revolution’ as it were.“My despair at the prospect was explained thus: ‘A civilian Buhari cannot do much amidst the barracuda politicians we have without being impeached, compromised, forced to resign, or eliminated.’ I argued that even as a military government, it didn’t take long before an internal military putsch terminated it.“My question sir, seeing, as Nigerians believe, that your APC is the PDP in all but name — comprising largely of politicians who are either not different from or have migrated from the PDP — how do you propose to go about your ‘cleansing’ of the systemic rot without being consumed by the system in a manner akin to how your military rule ended?”MB: “Yes, I remember reading that your piece which had an insightful beginning and middle and a poor, very poor, and despairing conclusion. (Laughter). You talked like one who has lost faith in Nigeria and the Nigerian. I think you even said something like you are sad or convinced that Nigeria’s problem is unresolvable. And that things will continue in the same ways for a long time to come — unmitigated rigging by unpopular incumbents to remain in power; corruption; indolence; etc.“But it hasn’t taken long before that premise of yours was disproved, has it? For the first time in Nigeria, an incumbent president was rejected at the polls to continue in office, even in spite of scattered attempts to keep to the rigging tradition. It has reached a point that Nigerians have had enough, and the majority truly yearns for a country that is well run, an economy that is structured and buoyant, a military that is capable of defending their country, a judiciary the ordinary man can repose faith in, institutions that are structured, disciplined, and patriotic, and a ‘Fourth Estate of the Realm’ that is not brown-envelope driven.”TF: “The colour of the envelope has changed, sir.”MB: “Tunde, on a serious note, a lot rests on the leadership. People take cue from the leadership, its body language, the matching of its utterances with its actions; its transparency. Nigerians are not by any yardstick different from human beings all over the world. And I will not accept that we are doomed to remain backward, undisciplined, unproductive, corrupt, for life. No.“For a start, I am publicly declaring my assets from day one, and I am asking my deputy and cabinet members to do likewise. If you can’t abide by that you don’t take the position. Simple. Then after that, the eyes of the world will be on you and your dealings to see by how much your declared assets have astronomically multiplied while in office. The institutions of checking against corruption will be strengthened and well funded and headed by like-minded incorruptible people. And, believe me, there are many out there. Didn’t we just have a Jega of INEC? How he has conducted himself throughout, in the face of unspeakable temptations, would anyone have believed of such a Nigerian in the past? When Nigerians begin to believe in the leadership and in the system, things will start to change and roll spectacularly.”TF: “But, sir, all this is sweet without considering the anomalous system and structure underpinning the whole wobbly edifice. Starting from the National Assembly — its size, composition, and nature — to the whole executive structure where the number of ministers, special advisers, special assistants, advisers to special advisers and assistants to special assistants, etc. have meant 70 or more per cent of our revenue going to paying overheads and recurrent expenditure. No nation in the world develops with such crippling load. Sir, with due respect, without figuring out how to change all that drastically and dramatically, it wouldn’t take long before you are frustrated or booted out of office. And I am yet to talk of the entire contradictory federal structure that has brought the clamour for a ‘true federalism’ or ‘fiscal federalism,’ and so on; hence the call for a (Sovereign) National Conference. How do you hope to deal with this myriad of problems sir.”MB: “The cynic in you again. Again, Tunde, I believe in Nigeria and I believe the majority of Nigerians want a change for the better. I believe that when they see a leadership that is open, transparent, progressive and purposeful, Nigerians will support any action or step to reorder the system and structure without necessarily bringing the roof down on everybody. Yes, I agree with you that the Legislature issues need to be addressed and urgently. I will support a unicameral system and will support reduction in size and remuneration of the legislature and even the executive.”TF: “But, sir, you will not have the whole time in the world to work some magic. Nigerians are impatient lot, especially after the years of locust they have just suffered. The honeymoon with you and your government will not be for more than six months when they would need to see visible changes in the system or in their lives. I am worried that…”MB: “Don’t be worried for me. The job at hand is for everybody to do. We will all have to join hands and heads to bring the change we want about. I am over 70 now and so I am not afraid to die. I am ready to help bring about the change Nigeria needs or die trying.”(The noise around the house was increasing in decibel by the minute. The crowd had begun to mass and chant: “Sai Baba,” “Sai Buhari,” “Sai Baba.” There was scant security to deter them. We could no longer hear ourselves talk. General Buhari looked at me in pity. “You have to go now,” he said. “Perhaps another opportunity will come in future for us to continue from where we left.”(The sun had risen out of the sky, its ray piercing through my window blinds unforgiving of my extended stay in bed. I woke up to the cacophony of the menagerie in my garden. The geese were gawking, the peacocks were neighing, the cockerels were persistent in their morning alarm, and my parrot had joined heralding the new dawn. It was all but a dream.

Last week we suggested that in view of the enormity of the repair works that the incoming Buhari administration would have to deal with, something more than the ordinary would have to be contrived in order to achieve a reasonable level of satisfaction for Nigerians who have endured the negative effects of the ruinous governing style adopted by the PDP in the past 16years. We then recommended something similar to the ‘New Deal’ model which President Franklin Roosevelt announced at his inauguration in his determination to pull America out of the Great Depression.Today, we would like to justify our decision to suggest this approach to the incoming administration. In doing this we would also highlight the key differences between the US society of the depression years and the Nigeria of today as well as the similarities and dissimilarities between the constitutional and political environments in the two countries.The All Progressives Congress, the APC, as the name implies, is a party with progressive tendencies. It has within its fold those we might call ‘capitalists’, ‘leftists’ as well as ‘social democrats’ and ‘sectarian humanists.’ But if, for example, the late Bala Usman, Festus Iyayi and other notable progressive intellectuals, dead or alive, were to join either the PDP or APC, it is most likely that they would ally with the latter. This is because it is the party that has embraced, no matter how perfunctorily, the progressive agenda to national development in which it is the duty of the government to promote the material well-being of the citizens. It is that philosophical inclination that has attracted many of us to it.That is quite different from the orientation of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Ideologically, it was just okay for the PDP that the gross domestic product (GDP) is expanding (remember the celebrations after the paper rebasing?), that there are more private jets in the country while the majority of the people are reeling under grinding poverty and serious material deprivations as a function of the ‘free market.’Irrespective of the latent diversity of the membership of the APC, it still remains, in the main, the party leaning more to the left of the centre of the political spectrum than the PDP and, as such, it must of necessity, take a principled stand in the inevitable debate as to the role of the state in social engineering.Aside from the abstract definition of progressive politics, the reality on the ground today has invested the APC with a binding social contract with the Nigerian electorate to tread the path of constitutional progressivism, i.e., the vigorous pursuit of the greatest good for the greatest number — the felicity calculus.A closer look at the voting pattern which brought the party to power shows a voting demographic comprised largely of the poor and the deprived of Nigeria. It was the votes of the poor of this country that put Buhari ahead at the polls. The APC, in spite of its devised composition, remains essentially the party of the poor and that fact creates an irrevocable philosophical obligation on APC-led government at all levels, to frontally address the challenges of poverty and inequality in a more progressive manner than any other party would have done. It is that reality that led me to the conclusion that it should offer the people of Nigeria a robust institutional relief in the form of a ‘New Deal’.While it is not a perfect model for social reconstruction, especially as the US experience has shown, it, however, still remains the best possible option available within a constitutional democracy faced with huge emergency situations such as we are facing at the moment.What is more, whereas, the textual orientation of the American Constitution as outlined by the founding fathers and the federalists, established a governing machinery that substantially limited the ability of the government to go beyond the protection of civil liberty and property (which accommodated slavery and racism), the Nigerian constitution on the other hand, adequately recognises that the State has a duty that extends beyond the mere enforcement of civil liberties to the provision of the right material conditions for the economic and social well-being of the citizens — a constitutional pathway for the establishment of a ‘welfare state’ offering appreciable social security to its citizens, something that required a Roosevelt’s ‘stubbornness’ to initiate and institutionalised because such was ideologically incompatibility with the dreams of America founding fathers as articulated in their Independent Declaration.The Nigerian Constitution written at a different era, on the other hand, in its Preamble, clearly declares that it is established “for the purpose of promoting the good government and welfare of all persons…,”It is therefore no longer debatable if an incoming progressive administration is constitutionally authorised to initiate broad policies and reformatory programmes that are designed to alleviate the abject living conditions of the masses.So far, three critical areas have come up for immediate attention, namely: combating the widespread poverty caused by unemployment; and unemployment occasioned by lack of economic activities to gainfully engage the people. Then, there is the lingering problem of insecurity which is a direct outcome of the two earlier challenges. Government must proceed to ameliorate the poverty in the land through appropriate institutional measures. It is a national emergency that must be dealt with extraordinarily and without delay.Whereas Roosevelt had to pay farmers to destroy farm produce in order to raise prices, our problems here is that there are just not enough production of anything of value from where earnings could reach the people. It therefore means that the immediate challenge would be how to put jobless people to work where they can gainfully produce stuffs or services that will invigorate the economy.To put millions back to work, we have to formulate a massive public works policy such as labour-intensive infrastructure construction methods across the length and breadth of Nigeria using whatever skills that are available in the hope that ‘practice makes perfect.’We would need to raise an army of engineers and technicians from the teeming unemployed and supposedly ‘unemployable’ graduates and turn them into efficient and effective workforce building houses, roads and bridges everywhere.Initiate policies to quickly restore the groundnuts pyramids to the North; the rubber and palm oil estates to the South-South; promote the food baskets in the middle belt; cocoa in the South-West and mining and manufacturing to the economy. Adding value by processing our products. A national policy of eating only what we can produce. The banking sector must be weaned from the present kalo-kalo business model into a real engine of growth through production-related lending; immediate redress of the woeful power situation. Luckily, this is one area where the outgoing regime did a great deal of work which must be taken advantage of because the availability of uninterrupted power is key to the success of a manufacture-propelled New Deal economy.Meanwhile, a “Brain Trust” made up of progressive intellectuals should be put in place to formulate the necessary blueprint. All these would require appropriate legislative and regulatory frameworks to put the programme ideas into immediate effect. Luckily, the APC is going to control the two chambers of the National Assembly and it should therefore be possible that within the first 100 days of inauguration, the key legislation needed to carry through these fundamental policy changes is put in place.How far we can go on this reform would surely depend on the personal integrity of the Number One Citizen and that will be our focus for next week.Copyright PUNCH.

Award-winning film-maker, Kunle Afolayan, bares his mind on his recent outburst on social mediaHow does it feel to have won the highest number of awards at the 2015 Africa Magic Viewers’ Choice Award?I am delighted, not because I won in some categories, but because ‘October 1’ won in several categories where people put in their best. Seeing all those people get rewarded was a thing of joy. AMVCA does not represent only Nigeria, but the entire Africa.Why do you believe the actors in your movie should have gotten more nominations?I think the performances of people like Sadiq Daba and Demola Adedoyin were quite outstanding and I am speaking the mind of a lot of people. Some people asked me why they were not nominated and I told them that I did not know the parameters the panel of judges used.Period movies are capital intensive; do you plan to shoot more films like that?Definitely, but we need to be sure that there will be funds to finance it, so we don’t start and get stuck. Recently, I had a meeting with the family of one of the past military heads of state who would love to do something about their father. It is going to be a period film and I am looking forward to it.In your recent tweet, you referred to a particular tribe…I was driving the previous day and I saw a guy with pirated copies of one of my movies. One of them threatened me after I accused him of selling pirated films. I got really frustrated, and that was led to the tweet. Some people just turned it to a tribal statement.In your tweet, you mentioned that the pirates threatened to release ‘October 1.’ How did they contact the distributor?Two weeks ago, we were in South Africa and someone sent him a text saying “We already have ‘October 1’; we will release it on Monday.” After working so hard and putting in so much, some people will attempt to reap where they did not sow. These take place at Alaba International Market where Igbo brothers and sisters operate. Few days ago, I got a text from a concerned Igbo colleague who told me the pirates had ‘October 1’ and were about to release it. It was a confirmation of what I heard earlier. We have done everything- gone to the Nigerian Copyright Commission, written to the police; I have also involved some government agencies in a bid to tackle the problem.Did the pirates demand compensation when they contacted G-Media?They said he should let them sell people’s pirated works. NCC is aware of this, because they actually invited G-Media and the pirates to a meeting. It is amazing that NCC would have a meeting with pirates.Are you saying NCC knows the pirates?NCC knows about the pirates yet they are not doing anything about it. When a pirated film is being sold, people will buy because they don’t know the difference between an original and a pirated copy as long as it plays and is clear.You have been accused of not featuring Igbos in your films…That is an unfair statement because I do not promote tribalism. How many core Yoruba actors have I featured in my films? There has to be a balance because we are Nigerians and we are telling a Nigerian story. I have never done a purely Yoruba-speaking film, so they can’t say I have a Yoruba agenda. Irapada was mostly shot in the North and had both Igbo and Yoruba characters; in ‘Figurine’ English, Yoruba and a dialect in Rivers State were spoken in the film. ‘Phone Swap’ represented more Igbos. ‘October 1’ also represented every tribe. I do not want to be called a Yoruba film-maker; I want to be called a Nigerian film-maker. If I put in so much effort into what I do and there are issues, I should be concerned.You have had appalling encounters with fans on social media at different times…There aren’t many people that make the class of films that Mildred Okwor, Chineze Anyaene, Obi Emelonye, Tunde Kelani and I do. Those are the kind of movies that get pirated- movies that are of great commercial value. Most of the industry practitioners that condemned my acts have not done such level of film before. I am not concerned about myself, but about the industry. There are some people on social media who do not know how to relate with people. That is one of the disadvantages you get from giving people free access to you. Some people do not understand simple grammar. Once they hear something, they just come on to hurl abuses. Some industry practitioners called to say I stated their mind only that it came at the wrong time. We know the truth, yet we shy away from it. I do not care about what tribe does what; I want a structure that will work so I can reap the reward of my labour. If some people frustrate that effort, it is always better to voice out together and not attach tribal sentiments to it.What could have made it a wrong time?It was a wrong timing because the Oba of Lagos made a statement the same day that the Igbos must vote Akinwunmi Ambode. People just merged the two together and said the Yorubas were against the Igbos.How do you handle the insults people hurl at you?There is no way it will not get to me because I am human, but I delete some and ignore others. I respond only to people that make sensible enquiries or statements. Some people are just too quick to pass judgment and it is a shame. It is not fair on me, the industry or my tribe.There are no copyright laws in Nigeria; maybe there are on paper but they are not effective. I have never seen anybody get prosecuted for pirating someone’s intellectual property. As far as I am concerned, the Nigerian Copyright Commission doesn’t do anything, so I’m as concerned as every other Nigerian artiste who has got something out there to lose.Can you proffer a solution to piracy in Nigeria?First of all, the copyright laws have to change. There must be instant judgment on anybody who violates any copyright law. It is a global problem and some of these pirates know the law. They know that the law is weak and that is why they do what they do.Is there a reason you always attend events dressed in traditional attire?That is because I am a Nigerian. People wear suits all the time, but I like to wear what I feel comfortable in. I like to represent my culture. If I am nominated for an Oscar, I will still wear agbada or something traditional to demonstrate where I am from.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Abdul Sule was recently appointed as the new chairman of Kogi United and Confluence Queens.Abdul Sule began his football career in 1993 with NUB Kaduna (New Union Bank) before leaving in 1994 to Stationery Stores FC in Lagos. He was transferred in July 1995 to BCC Lions.After six months, he left BCC Lions and moved to Qatar SC. With the Doha club he was one of the top scorers and was scouted by Danish side Herning Fremad in 1997. He played three years for Herning before moving in 2000 for a then-Danish record nine million DKK to Akademisk Boldklub, where he played five years for the club. He left in 2004 and signed a contract with Køge BK. He left the club after one year and moved to AC Horsens in 2005. The next year he transferred to Lolland-Falster Alliancen. In 2007 the striker played in the Malaysian Super League for newcomers Johor FC. In June 2008, he came back to Nigeria and signed a contract with Plateau United.He played ten games and scored two goals in Africa Cup and World Cup matches for the Super Eagles and was in the squad from 1990 to 1993.Later in 2008 the former Nigerian National Team player joined European Sports management (ESM) as an associated football scout and was then made a Sports Ambassador by Sportswear Firm Hummel.He will be hoping to making a lasting impression after taking over from Mallam Abdul Adama, at Kogi United and Confluence Queens, who resigned his position after 19 successful months in charge of the two teams.Abdul Sule was until his new appointment the Technical Adviser of Kogi United.In a chat shortly after his official unveiling at the Lokoja Confluence Stadium on, the soft-spoken man spoke on his vision and mission for the two clubs.Congratulations on your new appointment as the chairman of Kogi United and Confluence Queens. Don’t you see it as a huge challenge to you?Many thanks. I’m elated. We have always had challenges in our daily lives, from one step to another is a challenge and I see it as a positive challenge. The former chairman (Hon Abdul Adama) has laid a solid foundation and I’m coming to build. When I start building, it’s to the top of the building. I pray that we become successful.What are the things you will start with to continue with that development and foundation?I understand the terrain in Kogi United, so it’s much easier for me to continue. We had some challenges and we discussed it with Hon Adama before he left.Last season, Confluence Queens finished 5th in the Nigeria Women Premier League. What are the measures you hope to put in place in order for them to perform better in the 2014/15 season?Regarding the women team, I will meet with their technical crew before they resume on Monday 13th April then we would discuss the way forward. I was the technical director of the team, before I moved to Kogi United as the technical adviser. For some time, I haven’t really seen much of the girls’ training sessions. Now, I have to be watching them from close quarters and see how they are faring.You have travelled far and wide. Also you have defended the colours of Nigeria in the past. How do you hope to make a mark as an administrator in the round leather game?I want to make a big mark and try to change the face of the two clubs. I want to brand the clubs. We want to work with foreign investors, just like the deal we have with Hummel, the sportswear company that kitted us in the second round of the 2013/14 campaign.Fans are essential elements in the success of a team. How do you hope to foster a lasting relationship with the fans in order to aid the development of the Kogi United and Confluence Queens.Fans are crucial in the success of a team. We hope to do well on the pitch so that they can always be at the Stadium to see our matches. I believe that the technical crew of the two teams are working hard to entertain them in the upcoming campaign.How will you describe the support from His Excellency, Captain Idris Ichalla Wada and the immediate past Chairman Hon Abdul Adama?The support from His Excellency Governor Wada has been amazing. He has always made our welfare his priority. I will like to use this medium to appreciate His Excellency for not relenting in his support to the two teams. Hon Abdul Adama has worked very hard to get the teams to where they are today. He worked so hard and wanted the best for the teams.
Bowing their heads in prayer, a congregation of teachers, pastors and civil rights activists pleaded for mercy.“Our teachers were crucified the other day,” the Rev. Anthony Motley, pastor of Lindsay Street Baptist Church, cried from the pulpit as the crowd linked arms and swayed to the sound of an electric organ. “One of these days, one of these days, one of these days our teachers are going to rise up from this unjust grave.”Several hundred people had gathered at the First Iconium Baptist Church in East Atlanta for a prayer vigil to support a notorious group — 11 former Atlanta educators convicted of cheating to inflate student test scores.While many civic leaders, including Mayor Kasem Reed, welcomed the guilty verdicts earlier this month as the final resolution of a scandal that roiled the city for nearly six years, some are uneasy about the prospect of teachers serving up to 35 years in jail.Jurors in the Atlanta case — one of the largest academic misconduct trials in U.S. history — found 11 of 12 defendants guilty April 1 of violating Georgia’s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a charge that carries a prison sentence of up to 20 years.Some were also found guilty of additional felonies, such as influencing a witness, theft by taking, false swearing or making a false statement or writing.Their supporters complain that the teachers and administrators — all African Americans who worked in low-income neighborhoods — were unfairly targeted with a racketeering statute popularly associated with mobsters and gangsters.“Let me just say that this town is stirred up,” said Andrew Young, the civil rights leader and former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.It made no sense, he said, for educators to face lengthy prison sentences when so many Wall Street financiers were spared after taking part in lending abuses that devastated the U.S. economy.“It really made me angry to see teachers in handcuffs, because I’ve never seen a banker in handcuffs,” Young said. “To try this under a RICO statute was a sin and a shame, and the folk who did that will probably go to hell.”Opinion on the sentencing is sharply divided across Atlanta. About 51% of those who responded to an online poll on 11 Alive.com, the website of the local NBC affiliate, said the convicted educators should serve prison time, while 49% said they should not.After the verdict, former Gov. Sonny Perdue, a Republican who initiated the investigation into suspicious jumps in test scores in 2009, called the verdict “justice” for the “overwhelming number of passionate, dedicated Georgia educators.”Yet even some parents of children who were taught by the convicted teachers have misgivings about lengthy jail sentences.“Her sitting in jail is not going to help my daughter,” said Vanessa Haynes, whose 16-year-old daughter testified during the trial that her fourth-grade teacher, Angela Williamson, gave students answers to tests. Williamson faces up to 35 years in prison.“What are they going to do now for the children?” Haynes said. “What I want is restitution. Rather than have the lady locked up, she should tutor my daughter until she completes college.”The misconduct case sprang from a state investigation that implicated at least 178 teachers and administrators in “organized and systemic misconduct” in 44 Atlanta elementary and middle schools.By 2011, more than 80 educators had confessed to test tampering — some immediately, and others later, in exchange for immunity from prosecution.During the trial, prosecutors claimed that administrators set up a high-stakes testing system in which teachers received bonuses or were threatened with demotion, depending on students’ performance in standardized tests.The result was that thousands of low-income African American students who struggled to read and write were denied the opportunity of federal funds for remedial education.While cheating was undoubtedly wrong, Young said the teachers were not racketeers. “They were teachers who cracked under the heavy burdens a depressed society placed on them,” he said. “This is a time for us to judge by the spirit of the law and not the letter of the law.”The Rev. Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., has also called for leniency.“It would not lift humanity to have 11 educators subjected to an ‘eye-for-an-eye’ sentence,” she said in a statement. The teachers were themselves “victims of a corrupt education system,” she argued, and “the systemic issues that have plagued APS and other educational entities should be considered when weighing sentencing.”Fulton County Superior Court Judge Jerry W. Baxter has set sentencing for 10 of the 11 convicted educators for Monday. One, who was pregnant throughout the trial and delivered a son Saturday, remains free on bond and is likely to be sentenced in August.All face a minimum of five years and a maximum of 20 years in prison for the racketeering charge. However, Judge Baxter has discretion to sentence them to probation or suspend the sentences altogether.There were more than 200 RICO convictions across the United States in 2014, and the average prison sentence was just over 11 years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, which compiles federal government statistics.Jay S. Albanese, a criminologist and professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who specializes in RICO cases, said the Atlanta educators were unlikely to receive “average” RICO sentences, however, as they did not have extensive prior criminal records and posed little danger to society.Still, at the prayer vigil Tuesday night, many celebrated the convicted teachers as heroes who had been unjustly persecuted.The crowd belted out gospel hymns and shouted “Hallelujah!” Some stomped the floor, while others stood on pews as a string of speakers, including a retired state judge and a former Atlanta school superintendent, railed against prosecutors and the judge presiding over the trial.“The horrible face of white supremacy has rose again in black robes and blackface,” said First Iconium Deacon Tony R. Graves to thunderous applause. “I pray we will put a new face on the civil rights movement and make this a clarion call for everyone.”Speakers urged the congregation to sign petitions, write to Judge Baxter and rally outside the courthouse as sentencing takes place Monday.
A spectacular green and pink Aurora Australis has danced across the night sky near Tekapo.Images of the breath taking display were captured on Saturday night by Maki Yanagimachi, a photographer at Earth and Sky, the education centre linked to Mt John University Observatory."It's always a blast getting to shoot the southern lights regardless of how intense they may be. Nights like these make me feel very thankful that my grandfather got me into photography when I was ten years old," she said.Did you see the aurora? Send your photos to newstips@stuff.co.nzThe aurora flared up in two stages on Saturday night, around 8.30pm and 11pm."I've been taking photos of the aurora for a long time now but I still get excited when I see the glow in the southern sky," Yanagimachi said.The aurora took place within the Aoraki-Mackenzie Dark-Sky Reserve, recognised as one of the best stargazing spots in the world.Auroras are caused when solar flares send charged particles towards Earth which collide with the upper atmosphere.

His reporting and his photographs formed the foundation for what became known as the Anzac legend.But reporting the war, even after he had experienced it as a correspondent in the trenches, even after he had written the first book on the Gallipoli campaign, wasn't enough for Schuler.He donned a uniform, went to battle on the Western Front in France and Belgium and was dead before he was 28, the victim of a "stray" artillery shell, possibly from his own side.No one will ever know what Schuler might have become, but he was considered during his short life to be brilliant and daring enough to be a future leader of Australian affairs and letters.His great-niece, Minna Denholm, like so many relatives of promising young men who were lost, often wonders.She has the benefit of a family history written by her grandfather, Robin Denholm – himself the grandson of Gottlieb Frederick Schuler, Phillip's father – to inform her of her famous relative's exploits.But until now, she had never been to Gallipoli.Ms Denholm, a teacher from the Melbourne suburb of Surrey Hills, will join thousands of descendants and relatives of Anzacs gathering on Gallipoli for the 100th anniversary of the April 25 landing of 1915.She and her partner, Brent Jewell, will camp on the peninsula before attending the commemorative services on the shore and the hills trodden a century ago by her great-uncle.She expects to be washed by emotion, but hopes for a deeper understanding of this adventurous family member.The young Schuler consigned his own observations to his book, written at fever pitch in 1916, Australia in Arms: a Narrative of the Australian Imperial Force and their Achievements at Anzac.Schuler's reports from Gallipoli, his book and above all, his illuminating photographs from the trenches were crucial in the early understanding of Australians about what occurred above Anzac Cove, though he is less known now than Australia's official World War I correspondent, Charles Bean.Even before he got to Gallipoli, Schuler had written white-hot dispatches from Egypt, radiating his distress that the wounded were left suffering with little medical help on the the open decks of ships, shocking Australians at home and causing official inquiries."There is a case on record, I quote from exact knowledge, of a transport used as a hospital ship which arrived one afternoon in the harbour of Alexandria and the English disembarkation staff declined to commence the work of taking off the sick and instead went to the [horse races]," he wrote angrily."We were, in our family, raised with a sense of social justice and I think that's part of what drove him," Ms Denholm says. "He reported back with unvarnished humanity." Schuler got around the problem of front-line censorship concerning the Gallipoli campaign by returning briefly to Australia towards the end of 1915 to write Australia in Arms.The great Australian military commander, General Sir John Monash, wrote that he had seen the drafts of Schuler's book and judged it "quite the best and fullest story yet published of the whole Anzac campaign, and is remarkably accurate in details (more so than Ian Hamilton's dispatches)".It was high praise, complete with a barb at the British general and commander of the Gallipoli campaign, Sir Ian Hamilton, who had insisted on going ahead with the fight after it was obviously doomed, and who was eventually replaced.It was, however, Hamilton who helped the young Schuler get on to the peninsula in the first place. Though he sailed from Australia in the flagship of the first convoy of World War I, Schuler did not have accreditation for the landing at Gallipoli. That was reserved for the official correspondent, Bean.But the young correspondent for The Age was both tenacious – he had earlier been detained as a suspected spy by the British after making his own way to the island of Lemnos – and well-connected. His father, after all, was Gottlieb Frederick Schuler, editor of The Age from 1900 for 26 years.Phillip Schuler got the ear of Hamilton in Egypt, and gained a nod, a wink and a permit to find his way to Gallipoli.He arrived on July 20 and was there for the worst days of the campaign, the August Offensive, when Anzac troops launched themselves at the Turkish trenches at Lone Pine, and were slaughtered at The Nek.Schuler's dispatches to The Age from the front, filled with the horror of the battles and his own compassion for both Anzac and Turkish soldiers, remain among the finest reporting of the war.It is not known when or why Schuler decided he wanted to be part of the battle, rather than observer.But after writing his book at home in Hawthorn, he enlisted in the army and in early 1916, sailed for England and went on to the Western Front.His father – who had wanted Phillip to be a lawyer, not a journalist, leading to a troubled father-son relationship – was deeply upset at this development.Despite the rift, Phillip dedicated his book "to my father, in affectionate regard, from his son".Fourteen months later, the young man, a lieutenant, was dreadfully wounded shortly after the fierce Battle of Messines in southern Belgium. He died a few days later, on June 23, 1917, in a hospital in northern France and was buried in the nearby Trois-Arbres cemetery.Bean wrote that Schuler "had won much credit for his gallantry in the Battle of Messines". Ms Denholm says Gottlieb Frederick Schuler never really recovered from the death of his only son, burying himself in work, books and music until he died in 1926.Phillip Schuler's old Melbourne haunt, The Savage Club – where he wrote and acted in plays – recorded that "perhaps the most poignant news ever received in the old club rooms in Queen's Walk was when members learnt that 'The Club Baby' had been killed in action".Phillip, known to his friends as Peter, was "one of the brightest spirits ... an exuberant and scintillating personality".Ms Denholm will carry with her to Gallipoli the words of her great-uncle, written shortly before his death to his great friend, the prolific author and fellow Age journalist Roy Bridges."His last letter came to me by the last English mail of June 1917," Bridges wrote. "It ended 'keep on remembering'."
People moving in and out of temporary or insecure work are at a heightened risk of health problems, with new research revealing an "accumulation" effect of multiple spells of unemployment.Welfare advocates warn the findings cast doubt of the benefits of the Abbott government's recently unveiled $5 billion job services model, Jobactive, which heavily promotes temporary work as a "stepping stone" to long-term employment.The joint Australian-Swedish study tracked experiences of more than 1080 school-leavers and found that accumulated shorter spells of unemployment were damaging in similar ways to the well-established health effects of long-term joblessness.The findings, presented at the Australian Psychological Society's college of health psychologists conference on Friday, showed people were more likely to fall into health problems including depression and negative behaviours such as increased alcohol consumption and smoking if they had experienced intermittent unemployment.At a time of rising unemployment, under-employment and the decline of low-skilled work, job agencies say the study highlights an urgent challenge for federal government policymakers to tackle.Simon Mamone, senior psychologist with the Sarina Russo employment group, said the quality and security of jobs available in Melbourne had rapidly declined in the past six years.He said young Australian jobseekers were facing the most pressing problems as the unemployment rate for 15- to 24-year-olds hovered around 14 per cent."We are seeing a lot more of that intermittent work than part-time or full-time work," he said. "This puts young people behind ... it's the rung of the ladder that keeps getting knocked down and down. They start losing confidence in themselves and in employers."Daniel Robert, 20, worked at a gym in the city's south-east for two years after leaving school with a certificate in personal training. But when the gym closed, he faced more than a year of moving between part-time work and tireless job hunting.Mr Robert worked as a masseuse during the day and in a break-dance crew at night, while spending long hours looking for permanent work in retail, hospitality and personal training across Melbourne."It did stress me out ... at one point in time, I felt like not having work made me feel as if I wasn't worth much," he said."I felt like I wasn't doing anything even though I was constantly looking."Mr Robert, who has landed a good job at a fast-food restaurant, said moving in and out of work since leaving school had been difficult and the current jobs market was causing stress for many people in his age group.Last month, the Abbott government launched the $5 billion Jobactive system, which provides employment services with cash incentives to place jobseekers in short-term positions. The government said "data clearly demonstrates that people who have undertaken a few short-term employment opportunities are substantially more likely to gain permanent positions".Brotherhood of St Laurence executive director Tony Nicholson said sporadic and insecure unemployment had risen in Australia since the global financial crisis, and younger workers and those recovering from mental illness could be negatively affected by the focus on short-term work."As a general rule, having a job is better for a person's mental health than not having a job, even if it's short-term," Mr Nicholson said."But for people with mental illness, the lack of certainty week to week, month to month, can exacerbate anxiety because of the pressure they encounter ... and with young people who are trying to get a foothold in the world of work, it creates a loss of hope that they will be able to have stability of employment and income."Mr Nicholson said critical support programs from the Howard era helping school-leavers make the transition to employment did not receive funding last year.

Mother Nature did Juan Pablo Montoya a favor on Saturday, as lighting halted qualifying for the Grand Prix of Louisiana to give the series points leader pole position for Sunday's race.Montoya tops the standings thanks to his win in the season-opening Grand Prix of St. Petersburg on March 29.The Penske driver will therefore lead the field into the inaugural 75 lap race on the 2.74-mile (4.41 Km) NOLA Motorsports Park circuit in suburban New Orleans.Australian Will Power, the 2014 IndyCar champion and Montoya's team-mate, will join Montoya on the front row.The qualifying cancellation was a boon for Montoya, who had failed to advance out of the first of three qualifying segments after his car slid off course on its final lap.On a rain-soaked track, Brazil's Tony Kanaan led the first qualifying group with a time of 1 minute, 38.0125 seconds in his Chip Ganassi Racing Chevrolet.The second group of the first segment was four minutes into its 10-minute session when lightning in the area halted qualifying. Conditions worsened and qualifying was not resumed.Kanaan, who holds the Indy car record for consecutive starts that is currently at 234 and counting, will start third and fellow Brazilian Helio Castroneves fourth.
Is it the shiny bonnet, leather smell or zero kilometres on the clock? New cars have plenty of appeal, but the biggest question remains how to pay for them.For thousands of people, the answer is a Personal Contract Plan (PCP). The garage does the paperwork, the interest rate is super-low (or even nothing at all) and your acceptance chances are higher than begging your bank manager. So what’s the catch?On one hand, PCPs, or Hire Purchase plans, do everything they say on the tin. You get a new car at low cost and the garage gets a sale. Why would anybody go elsewhere?The answer has to do with ownership. A PCP means that your car is no more yours than it would be had you picked it up at the airport from Hertz.It is hired, rented, leased (pick your terminology), until the very last payment is made. As this can be anything up to five years, it’s a long term commitment to remain in a job, afford the payments and not want to change model.Some 64,716 new cars were registered in the first quarter of 2015, up 30pc on last year, indicating a return of consumer confidence. When it comes to turning corners out of recession, it seems we want a new set of wheels to make the manoeuvre.Tom Cullen of the Society of Irish Motor Industry (SIMI) says the top three marques are Volkswagen, Toyota and Ford, and claims PCPs are “a fantastic product, hugely popular and a real growth area”.Despite this he says Ireland has a relatively immature market. “In the UK, up to 80pc of new car sales are via PCPs. Many manufacturers like Volkswagen and Renault have their own banks,” he says. “During the recession people had stopped changing their car and we ended up with an eight or nine-year-old fleet.“Having fallen out of the loop, many are seeing increased job security and coming back into showrooms and making the leap to new with a PCP, with guaranteed values when the contract is over.”The rates certainly are attractive. Both Opel and Citroen offer 0pc finance on many models. Seat has credit at 3.9pc, Peugeot from 4.9pc and Volkswagen from 5.9pc — all much lower than the 11pc to 14pc you can expect on a bank loan.However, deposits required are generally between 30pc and 50pc and terms are shorter. With Opel, for instance, repayments are for a maximum of 24 months and half the cost upfront is required. The bank won’t lose, as the depreciation will be less than the value upon its return.With some, such as Citroen, the deal is more complicated. The deposit is a minimum 30pc, and the car is given a Guaranteed Minimum Future Value (GMFV) by the bank (in this case, its own UK based finance house).The GMFV is their reckoning of what the car will be worth after the three year repayment term and is dependent, among other things, on a maximum 20,000km per annum mileage limit and keeping it in good condition. Cullen says this is typical.“The PCPs do come with terms and conditions — but if you’re an average driver with average mileage looking after your car, it’s fine.” A worked example for the C1 Touch VTi looks like this:On the Road Value: €11,145On the surface, it’s a no-brainer — repayments are kept low because you’re not making them all during the term. The use of the GMFV leaves you with three options: (a) return the car, just like you would a hire car, and walk away; (b) pay the outstanding balance of €3,901 (commonly called a ‘balloon payment’) or (c) roll over the loan into a new car and start the process again.The difference with a credit union or personal loan is that borrowings are unsecured, meaning that although they will certainly chase you if you fall behind on payments, they can’t rely on the security of the asset to recoup the loss.This is why you pay higher interest — it is for the added risk. The car is your property and it cannot be taken from you. It means that if say, you lose your job, at least you have your motor to get to interviews.If your car is financed through PCP, it is deemed a ‘secured’ loan and remains the property of the finance house and can technically be taken from you and sold to pay off the loan.But there is an out, as Susan Cosgrove of Cosgrove Gaynard Solicitors explains.“Under S.63 of the Consumer Credit Act 1995 there is a protection known as the Half Rule. This entitles you to terminate a hire purchase agreement and pay 50pc of the hire purchase price.“A 2011 High Court decision, Gabriel vs GE Money, ruled that the Act provides this as a standalone right at any time before the final payment falls due. Under section 63(2) there are two options: pay half the hire purchase price less the amount paid to date or purchase the car from the HP company.“Otherwise, the bank has the right to recover the vehicle immediately and is entitled to issue proceedings for the balance if not so paid.“Importantly, the court also found that the practice of some finance companies in refusing to accept back cars where agreements were terminated by a hirer was wrong.“It ruled that they cannot treat the payment of 50pc as a precondition to termination and therefore a company cannot refuse to take the car back in advance of the sum being paid avoiding purchasers having to hold on to cars they couldn’t afford.”What should be avoided is signing an Voluntary Surrender Form which would make hirers liable for the balance of the loan, while still returning the car.But perhaps the real truth is, if it’s the only way you can afford new, maybe the second-hand market is the one for you.
There was more good news for those hunting for jobs in recent days. As the sun finally came out, unemployment figures dropped to their lowest level in more than six years at 10pc.While there are definite grounds for optimism, the Dunnes strike over low hours contracts would have caused many to pause for thought about what kind of jobs there will be in Ireland during the recovery. Will they be well-paid and secure?Strictly speaking, the Dunnes workers who picketed stores across the country do not have the much-publicised zero-hours contracts.However, according to their union Mandate, most do not have certainty beyond 15 hours on how many hours they are going to work from week-to-week. Spokesman David Gibney says: "They feel that they can't plan their life, plan their future and there's no financial security."They may grab the headlines, but the Dunnes workers are by no means exceptional in Ireland of 2015. The new breed of employee is increasingly working unpredictable hours on insecure contracts, frequently on low pay.Welcome to the world of the "precariat". The term was coined near the start of this decade by the economist Professor Guy Standing to describe a class of worker, whose career is unpredictable.Typically they are temps - part-timers working in shops, hotels or call centres - and often they are classed as self-employed contractors.They may be graduates struggling to make a decent living on internships or JobBridge schemes.Where once employees could hope for secure full-term contracts, now Professor Standing says the new precariat has a working lifetime consisting of disjointed bits. With little security or guaranteed income, they can struggle to build a career.Professor Standing has predicted the rise of a phenomenon known as "crowdworking", where keyboard workers try to earn a crust by bidding online for small online tasks, and are paid a small amount for each task.There are no precise figures on the number of workers who work on zero-hours contracts in Ireland. However, clues can be found in figures from the Central Statistics office. There are currently 130,000 people classed as "part-time underemployed". This means they are part-timers who would like to do full-time work.Ultimately, these low-paid part-timers come at a cost to the State, because many have to top up their incomes with social welfare.Employment lawyer Richard Grogan says: "There has been a considerable increase in the use of zero-hours contracts, particularly in the hospitality industry, restaurants, distribution and the cleaning industry."A zero-hours contract of employment is an arrangement where the employee is available for work but does not have specified hours of work.Richard Grogan says: "A number of these contracts are being put in place, effectively to create a form of bonded labour, where the employer effectively has absolute control over the employee."In some cases, the employee may not be allowed to work for another company, even though they have very few hours.Close observers of these developments suggest that some employees may be working on zero-hours arrangements without even knowing it, because the contracts are effectively disguised. One legal source says: "A typical contract might suggest that the 'normal office hours are 9 to 5.30' and 'You will be required to work such hours as required by the company from time to time'."You might think that means you work from 9 to 5.30, but it could be zero. The hours could be cut at any time."The phenomenon is not confined to low-paid sectors such as retailing and the hospitality sector. It seems to have spread into middle-class jobs as well.A recent survey found that one in six pilots in Europe are "atypical employees". This means they may work through a temporary work agency, are self-employed, or on a zero-hours contract with no minimum pay guaranteed.Stephen Kinsella, economist at the University of Limerick, says the rise of the precariat is being driven by globalisation."Dunnes Stores is not competing with your local shop. It is competing with Lidl, Aldi and Tesco. So in a global marketplace, it has to reduce its cost base. It's good for the employer because they want flexibility, but it's not good for the employee."One labour law analyst says some zero-hours working arrangements in the hotel industry may be legitimate."A lot of the work is seasonal. You might have a waiter who works on functions and there isn't a wedding on every night. The trouble is that employers are also using these terms for regular jobs such as cleaners and kitchen staff, where the demand for labour is consistent."Since it was launched four years ago, the JobBridge scheme, where workers can top up their unemployment benefit by €50 by working as interns, has attracted controversy. Critics say it displaces well-paid entry-level jobs.Just under 40,000 workers have taken part in JobBridge, and a recent survey by the National Youth Council of Ireland shows decidedly mixed feelings about it among participants.Of those surveyed, 57pc said they were satisfied with their internship. However, 44pc said they thought the scheme was used for free labour.Labour lawyer Richard Grogan says: "JobBridge employees have no protection whatsoever when it comes to employment rights."However, other types of intern have a right to the minimum wage and other rights."Richard Grogan draws the distinction between those who may work for a vet or a solicitor as an intern to see if they are interested in a career, and the qualified low-paid intern who is taken on long term."What is happening is that you are getting people who are qualified being offered internships on some hope that they will get a job. This can simply be a way of getting cheap labour."While unemployment is dropping, the growth in the number of jobs is not consistent across the country and economists have described the upturn as a "two-tier recovery".A recent report by the Nevin Economic Research Institute found that the recovery is heavily concentrated on Dublin and its hinterland.While the overall report is positive, it shows that employment growth is sluggish in western and border counties.With two law degrees and a ­Masters, Joseph Loughnane might have expected a smooth path into the workforce.But like thousands of other young workers, NUI Galway graduate came to his present job on a circuitous route via a call centre and an unpaid internship in London and the dole queue.Despite applying for jobs at solicitors' offices for six years, Joseph says he never had an offer of paid work in his chosen field.Unable to secure an internship in Ireland, Joseph used his savings from working in a call centre for a few months to do a six-month placement at a human rights organisation in London.Joseph found the work worthwhile, but his emigrant experience became one of penury, as he ran out of money. He lost two stone in weight, having struggled to feed himself on £20 (€27) a week."The organisation was small and couldn't afford to pay me," the 28-year-old says. "My friend and I were paying £500 each a month on rent and I only had money for one meal a day.""Young people now are told that they have to internships in order to fill up their CV. But what is the point if you are not getting an income and don't have enough work to live."It definitely discriminates against those who are not from wealthy families, because if you don't have financial backing, you can't afford to do the job and get the experience that you need."With his raft of third-level qualifications, Joseph feels he was over-qualified when he was applying for jobs."I had to downplay my qualifications if I was going for an interview. If you show them that you have too many degrees, they might think you will be bored in the job. A lot of my contemporaries either have to go abroad or take unpaid internships in order to gain experience."Joseph now has a full-time job in taxi regulation.
The word "sustainable" has been so misused in economic, environmental and business circles, as to have become almost meaningless.An awful lot of rhetoric and resource is spent on allegedly sustainable practices which don't add much to the likelihood of any business lasting longer. And yet, if asked, most of us would agree that there is something to be said for an argument that businesses should be sustainable.If we have learned anything over the past five years, it is that unsustainable models cost. And these costs are often borne not only by investors, but by a wider community - employees, customers, sometimes even society as a whole.Increasingly, many prefer to focus on the term 'resilient', denoting a model which can both thrive in a normal range of circumstances and survive and recover in stressed scenarios.As the economy enters a phase of recovery, there are also changes pending which will support businesses that seek a more sustainable model - the move internationally towards conscious capitalism, which asks businesses to focus on the totality of their activities and the impact of those activities.Sustainability in a business context isn't just about doing things which have a positive impact on the environment. In business, it extends to building a resilient business, with a positive impact on all stakeholders. It's about better decisions, resource efficiency, cost reduction, improving productivity, becoming truly innovative, taking longer-term decisions and protecting reputation.What does this mean in practice?A business which creates value in the short, medium and long term for all of its stakeholder groups is ultimately more sustainable than one which is focused entirely on short-term financial profit.Stakeholder groups include not just investors but also customers, employees, suppliers, business partners, society at large. A genuine, sustainable business mission will have value at its core and will seek to enhance value for all groups.Planning is the essence of the successful business. More effort expended in designing the steps required to render the business both successful and capable of surviving an economic shock is rewarded. Creating time and space to plan in the short to medium term is the challenge.A sustainable business or organisation structure is flexible and adaptable to changing business needs and to a fast-changing external environment.Historically, organisation structures tended to be rigid - but sustainable business needs greater flexibility in order to respond and adapt to changes.This capacity of the business to adapt and respond quickly to changes is what determines its long-term viability.Those charged with governance are responsible for creating an appropriate oversight structure to support the ability of the organisation to create value.At board level, long-term resilience can be overlooked due to understandable pressure to focus on short-term profits. What gets more notice at board meetings - quarterly results or longer-term forecasts?If sustainability is considered and viewed through the lens of risk to business continuity, the focus of those charged with steering the organisation would be sharpened in favour of the sustainability agenda.A key challenge for any business is the management of and allocation of resources.In the next five years we see particular challenges around the development and protection of people, in nurturing appropriate management skills as being key competitive differentiators - as well as contributors to resilient businesses.Our research in the SME sector shows the application of relatively rare management skills as the key differentiator between successful, sustainable businesses and others.Building sustainability and resilience into an organisation's supply chain is a challenge which cannot be underestimated. Multi-layered subcontracting is just one of the supply chain challenges to sustainability.A comprehensive review and analysis of the supply chain through each of the 'stages' (sourcing, manufacturing, distribution, consumption - and post-consumption recycling/re-use) and across resources like human and financial capital will highlight the weak points.These weak points will generally fall into two broad types in terms of potential impact-cost/margin erosion and reputational damage.There is a significant reputational aspect to becoming more sustainable. In Ireland, with the exception of those reporting to international audiences, we have yet to take any significant steps in how corporates, the public sector or not-for-profits report outside of the traditional annual report.Internationally, however, other forms of non-financial reporting have been becoming more mainstream as the constraints of traditional corporate reporting are recognised. These new forms support the goal of developing sustainable businesses.Sustainability reporting, integrated reporting and CSR reporting, are some of the frameworks which are either still evolving or which have been operational in some jurisdictions for some time now. It is only a matter of time before there is a significant shake up and streamlining of mandatory reporting requirements.Of course, growth, profit and cashflow all remain essential. However, there is an opportunity now to lay down foundations to ensure long-term success.Sustainability has been conflated with a type of environmental and CSR concerns. It encompasses these concepts, but goes further. The development of your business for the long term is a key priority, and should drive the agenda of your business in a tangible way.Mark Kennedy is a partner at Mazars, the accounting and business advisory firm
Lawyers from the New Beginning agency will turn up at every court where home repossession cases are being heard from tomorrow.Repossessions are expected to surge after the latest Central Bank figures revealed that the main banks were now threatening 31,000 homeowners with the loss of their properties.New Beginning say their representatives will attend courts, offer advice to borrowers and arrange for a full financial and legal assessment.Tomorrow, home repossession hearings will take place in Cork, Donegal, Laois, Wicklow, Kildare, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford - the first of 1,000 repossession cases which will come before the courts this week.The service is not free and people who wish to use it will have to pay €150 - though New Beginning say they will waive the fee in certain circumstances.New Beginning says that most people coming before the courts facing repossession are employed."It is just a question of too little income facing too much debt," said founder Ross Maguire SC.The agency has written to all of the county registrars in the country to inform them of its plans. It has also written to the President of the Circuit Court, Mr Justice Raymond Groarke.More than 120,000 people are directly affected by repossessions and face eviction from their homes."This is a population greater than Cork city. Over the coming months these cases are coming before the courts and New Beginning intends to be there to assist borrowers. This week alone over 1,000 cases of banks seeking possession of family homes will be listed before the courts," Mr Maguire said.New figures show the threats to take homes off people make up 40pc of the "solutions" the banks are proposing as part of targets set for them by the Central Bank for dealing with the arrears crisis.More than 17,000 of these mortgage holders are already at a more advanced stage of the repossession process.Some of these people have already given up their homes voluntarily, the Central Bank said.The figures, which set out how the banks have dealt with targets set for them by regulators, show just 46,000 of those in arrears on a residential home loan have had their mortgages restructured.New Beginning believes that most of cases coming before the courts can be resolved without the loss of the family home, provided there are systems in place to deal with borrowers "whose finances are so impaired as to make them unable to repay even a restructured mortgage"."This involves industrial-style solutions which will involve ownership in properties passing to large group-housing owners who can then lease them to the individual borrowers or to local authorities who can lease them on to those same people," Mr Maguire saidHe suggested that this will require new thinking, but inevitably these solutions will need to be forced onto the system."At the moment, it is in a state of paralysis. We can force this through by developing strength in numbers. We believe that where we put forward sustainable solutions, the courts should not order evictions. We will ask them - 'Are you going to put a family out on the road when there is a better way?'"Last week it was reported that the Government is considering new measures to deal with the mortgage-arrears crisis, including proposals for a new scheme that would allow people in significant arrears to stay in their homes.The package of measures may also involve legislation to weaken the veto banks enjoy in personal insolvency deals, though court actions will continue against borrowers who refuse to discuss arrears with their lenders.The Irish Times reported that the Government is also considering a separate scheme that would allow borrowers to retain ownership of their properties, but offer them ongoing State support to help them pay their mortgages.
TV3 bosses expect revenue and profitability to grow at the broadcasting group this year, despite losing big ratings pullers Coronation Street and Emmerdale to UTV Ireland.The group - which includes TV3, the recently launched TV3+1 and 3e - has seen its market share dip 2pc to 10.6pc in the first three months of its rival's existence, Nielsen figures show.UTV pulled in almost 6pc of the audience, with RTE's share also falling by around 2pc.But the group is hopeful that its exclusive rights to the Rugby World Cup and the X Factor in Ireland will attract more eyeballs later in the year.The rugby deal will be a loss leader, but the station hopes it will be able to keep some of the new viewers the tournament attracts. Their team of presenters includes Neil Back, Keith Wood and Shane Jennings.Losing the soaps will save the company around €15m a year in contract fees, an industry source told the Sunday Independent.Management are ploughing some of that money into content the station owns, which gives it more flexibility to generate revenue from new sources like product placement deals.Costcutter and Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Irish Daily Mail, have signed such deals."On pure TV3 and spot revenue we absolutely expect to be down in 2015, but we expect that to be more than made up for with 3e revenue, 3 player revenue, the revenue that we get from the +1 channels, plus rugby," TV3 commercial director Pat Kiely told the Sunday Independent.Having more Irish content will give the group more scope for selling its programming internationally. It recently signed a deal for international distribution with Sky.It has also set up a dedicated unit to explore making more advertiser-funded programming (AFP)."The Restaurant would be a good example - Aldi was a big funding partner on that show," Mr Kiely said."We've a lot of big shows out there that we're in discussions with potential AFP partners on".Speculation has surrounded the group's future in recent weeks with owner Doughty Hanson rumoured to be considering a sale.US media giant Viacom, whose brands include MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, was interested in the business at one point, but is no longer in the running, the Sunday Independent understands.Mr Kiely would not comment on whether a takeover was in the offing, but said TV3 is "a very interesting proposition for a lot of investors".
Beef baron Larry Goodman stands to make a fortune - another one that is - from the former Bank of Ireland head office on Dublin's Baggot Street.Goodman bought the 220,000 sq ft office block in 2012 for €40m. The refurbishment will cost around €70m.His Remley Developments needed the go- ahead for the refurbishment from An Bord Pleanala because the building is a 20th century architectural masterpiece which is a protected structure.I always thought it was a bit too stuffy any time I went in there for Bank of Ireland press conferences in the past. Then again, perhaps that didn't have much to do with the architecture.Whatever about the interior, the façade was inspired by the style of the iconic 1958 Seagram building in New York. It was one of the first to have an open plaza out the front for staff to hang out and relax.The Baggot Street building was designed in the 1960s by Ronald Tallon, who remained a director of architects Scott Tallon Walker for 55 years, until his death last year.After refurbishment, the building would stand Goodman around €110m. The Comer brothers say they expect to get €45 to €55 per sq ft in rent at the former Vets College site in Ballsbridge when they are finished developing it.A similar figure would see Goodman's Bank of Ireland building land around €11m per year in rent. At a yield of 6pc, it would be worth €183m.Permanent TSB's TV advertising campaign slogan is "Back to basics", and the bank's board certainly got a right dose of it at the AGM last week.Shareholders launched a verbal assault from the floor on enormous interest rates being charged on variable rate mortgages.One shareholder, Breda O'Byrne gave chairman Alan Cook and CEO Jeremy Masding a tongue-lashing. She rather eloquently summed her view as: "Permanent TSB my arse!"It isn't quite what Messrs Cook and Masding were used to over at National Savings and Investments or Central Trust across the water. Cook is also a non-executive director of Sainsbury Bank, which knows a lot about charging very low interest rates.Sainsbury Bank raised quite a few eyebrows recently when it started offering cut-price personal loans of up to stg£35,000 over five years for as little as 6.9pc. These are unsecured personal loans and compare very favourably with the 8.5pc to 11.5pc offered by some of its UK competitors.Some PTSB mortgage holders, on fully secured 25-year mortgages, are being charged around 4.5pc.The difference is that Sainsbury Bank makes about £60m per year and is rumoured to be considering a move into the mortgage market in the UK.Cook went to great lengths last week to emphasise that PTSB can't reduce variable mortgage rates because the bank is still losing money - €48m last year in fact.But Breda Byrne was like a knife cutting through butter when she analysed the mixed messages about the performance of PTSB. She told Masding, "you are telling us it's improving and the other fella [Cook] beside you is telling us it's a loss-making bank. "A veteran of shareholder battles at Eircom, Ms Byrne showed deep understanding of bank balance sheets (and prowess at cutting to the chase) when she referred banks' flexibility in presenting financial performance by making adjustments to the provision figures for bad loans.She might make an excellent board member.With the Government all set to back a €1.3bn takeover of Aer Lingus by IAG, the State does seem to have handled the pay packet of former chief executive Christoph Mueller in a rather tawdry way.Mueller was paid €1.2m in 2014, his last full year in the job. His remuneration was opposed by the State, although it passed the AGM by a 0.0001 margin.Mueller was well paid but he did a great job. In 2008 Aer Lingus earned €1.35bn in revenue with a staff cost of €334m (24.2pc). After several years of crisis, re-structuring and re-positioning, Aer Lingus generated revenues of €1.55bn last year with staff costs of €300m (19.3pc).Mueller did much to steer the airline through an extraordinary storm and it has come out stronger. So much so, that the Government believed it was worth more than €1.3bn just a few weeks ago.The Government's vote against Mueller's remuneration must have soured things for him - as no doubt Bertie Ahern's onslaught in the Dail against his predecessor Willie Walsh soured things for him.Now that National Toll Roads (NTR) has bagged a mountain of cash from the sale of US wind farms, how much will Tom Roche be willing to pay to buy out shareholders who want to exit the company?One51 and Nick Furlong's Pageant Holdings want to sell, but presumably not at any price. NTR has hired independent consultants to assess the value of the business.However, it is understood that no binding agreement exists between shareholders to accept whatever valuation the independent advisers place on the company. Plus there are 2,000 small investors. This is where it could get really interesting with a possible shareholder bunfight.National Toll Roads will receive €179m from last week's sale of two wind farms. It has another €41.3m coming from the sale of its Osage wind farm. It is owed around €18m from Greenstar North America.At the end of December 2014, it had about €47m in cash but also has a tax liability.Then there are the smaller assets, such as the €10m invested in European wind so far, €20m to €25m for its 50pc share of Celtic Anglian Water, another €15m owed from SES Solar. The list goes on.Some sellers might argue National Toll Roads is worth €300m to €330m - or roughly €3.25 per share. What happens if Roche disagrees?
Wednesday saw Permanent TSB chairman Alan Cook plead with shareholders to be quiet at the bank's agm.Permo's management faced lots of angry heckling on issues from the bank's variable mortgage rates to the extent of its planned €525m capital raise.Management said there can't be a rate cut because the bank is still making a loss.Chief Executive Jeremy Masding has met around 100 potential investors and should be able to provide an update on the capital raise within weeks.Later in the week, the European Commission told the bank to shrink its book of tracker mortgages as a condition of approval for the bank's restructuring plan.The Prof told an event in Paris that the law "deserves to be strengthened to take account of egregious recklessness in risk-taking by those who were in charge of failed financial firms".The UK Financial Conduct Authority recently unveiled a proposal that would see senior bank managers asked to show that they took "such steps as a person in their position would be expected to take" if a firm is guilty of misconduct.Business leaders and tax experts warned the Government of potential problems with the vaunted Knowledge Development Box.The scheme would give companies a tax break on income derived from intellectual property.But Ibec thinks that the current plan is too narrow to encourage a wide range of sectors to engage in research and development.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is developing global rules for this kind of scheme, and Ibec isn't happy."Restrictions on the outsourcing of R&D mean that smaller countries with limited skills pools in specialist areas will be disadvantaged by the new regime compared to larger countries," Ibec said.US drugmaker Mylan launched a shock offer to buy its Irish-based rival Perrigo for €26.5bn.The move sent stocks in both companies soaring. The merged company would be a generic-medicine juggernaut."This combination would result in meaningful immediate and long-term value creation, and our proposal is designed to deliver that value to shareholders and other stakeholders of both companies," Mylan said.Perrigo is best known here for buying Elan for almost €6.7bn in 2013. The company is based in Dublin's Treasury Building.Twitter shares rose by almost 4pc on Wednesday amid reports that it had knocked back a takeover attempt from Google.Financial website briefing.com said two firms had approached Twitter with serious intent, naming Google as one.Both Twitter and Google declined to comment when contacted by the Irish Independent.
The Government has yet to publish a study estimating the impact of Ireland's renewable energy target on consumers' pockets, five years after the target was introduced.Billions of private and public money has been spent in an effort to ensure 40pc of Ireland's electricity is supplied by renewable sources by 2020, but the Government has yet to produce a cost/benefit study of what the targets will mean for consumer bills by then.Different groups have published studies on the effects of renewable energy. Some have shown additional wind energy lowering wholesale electricity costs, but the effect of that is countered by the need to upgrade the grid and the public service obligation levy on energy bills. A report recently commissioned by the Irish Wind Energy Association said meeting the 40pc domestic target was expected to lead to higher bills, but that adding more wind capacity above and beyond the target would make bills fall.A spokeswoman from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources said the Government believes it is necessary to take a broader look and will soon publish a report."It was considered timely to undertake and publish analysis which takes a broader look at the components contributing to the projected costs, in order to inform public debate and commentary on the cost and financial impact on the electricity customer," she said.A new study was carried out by four different taxpayer-funded agencies - the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Sustainable Energy Authority Ireland (SEAI), EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation. It compares the cost, for 2020, for Irish energy consumers of two electricity generation scenarios.One scenario involves meeting 40pc renewable penetration and the other is on Ireland's energy supply mix, as of the end of 2013, when it was below 20pc.Economist Colm McCarthy recently called for the target to be scrapped, saying it was "pointless" and not in the national interest.
Penrith's injury curse shows no signs of abating with Peter Wallace to have knee surgery and fears Jamal Idris and Elijah Taylor may have suffered long-term NRL injuries.Wallace missed the Panthers' first win in a month, 22-12 over Manly on Saturday night, with an ongoing knee complaint on which he had surgery last year.He will go under the knife again on Tuesday with coach Ivan Cleary saying he will miss up to six weeks.There were initial fears Idris had suffered a season-ending ACL injury but he will go for scans on Monday that will better determine the extent of the injury.Taylor has suffered a cartilage problem and will also undergo scans on Monday.Both players suffered the injuries in the second half of the round-six win that snapped a three-game losing streak, and did not return to the action.Wallace was a late withdrawal before the four-tries-to-two win."Pete is going to go in for surgery on Tuesday, it is a cartilage thing he has been having trouble for the whole season pretty much on the back of his reconstruction and he got another jam in it the other week," Cleary said."It has worn him down, it just got too bad, but the good news is that once he has that surgery he won't have the ongoing troubles that he has had because he has pretty much been playing busted the whole year."It is a testament to his toughness, hopefully it will get him to a point when it is functioning properly"It is about four to six weeks so it is similar to when Sowie (Jamie Soward - back surgery) is going to be back."Cleary did not want to speculate on the worst-case scenarios for Idris and Taylor."We have a couple of scans to wait for ET and Jamal is the same, all we can do is cross our fingers," he said."They were talking about Jamal maybe going back on so I'm not going to say too much, we will just see what happensThe injury dramas were not all one way with Brett Stewart (groin) pulling out for Manly pre-game and Tom Trbojevic suffering a suspected serious ankle injury and Jesse Sene-Lefao also leaving the field in the first half with a shoulder complaint.Neither player returned to the game as last-placed Manly slumped to its fourth successive loss.Toovey said Stewart and captain Jamie Lyon are likely to miss another week.Trbojevic and Sene-Lefao will be sent for scans on Monday.
Two French male tourists have been charged with animal cruelty after they allegedly tried to burn a quokka on Rottnest Island.Police allege the two men burnt the quokka after igniting an aerosol spray with a lighter, causing a large flame to make contact with the animal on April 3.Detectives went to Rottnest on Saturday, questioned the two men and seized a video.Both were then evicted from the island.And 18-year-old man and a 24-year-old man, who were both staying in Cockburn, have been charged with animal cruelty.The pair are due to appear in the Fremantle Magistrates Court on April 17.In February this year six quokkas were found dead in Rottnest's "tent land".
There are some days you know your life will change forever and for Gabriel Moynagh, today is one such day.The visibly nervous young entrepreneur is sitting opposite me in the Davenport Hotel off Merrion Square, eyeing his phone like a hawk. He's staying at the hotel so as to remain in a state of readiness for the birth of his first child, which is due any minute now - his wife, Amy, is two weeks overdue, and is currently holed up at The National Maternity Hospital in Holles Street."She's thrown off my whole schedule, it's very inconsiderate of her," he smiles. There's a sense of optimism in the air."It looks like it's definitely going to be today. Definitely. I'm very excited of course. It seems like it's going to mean a lot of responsibility."I think I am going to have to do a lot of growing up myself. I'm sure I'll handle the restless nights. I'll finally have to get my act together."The acute sleep deprivation, endless responsibility and fierce sense of protectiveness that are part and parcel of new fatherhood might equally be applied to the life of entrepreneur.And Moynagh is being modest, since his act has long since been gotten together.The 33-year-old spent the best part of the last decade nurturing his other baby - Sysnet - from its humble beginnings in IT support into becoming one of the global big boys in cyber security.The Irish company builds and supports mutually-beneficial relationships between SMEs and financial institutions through the provision of technological solutions. It helps businesses of all sizes to protect their valuable company information from cyber security threats and currently has clients globally in 200 countries.More than 800,000 merchants use its proprietary compliance management solution.In the UK and Ireland, Sysnet works with the top seven financial organisations including Barclays and Lloyds. In the US, Sysnet's clients include WorldPay and US Bank, and the firm's consultancy and software development arms have blossomed as well.The company also provides consulting services to numerous retail behemoths including Walmart, Nationwide Building Society, and ABSA bank.Headquartered in Dublin, the firm also has offices in Atlanta, Salt Lake City, London, Cape Town, Kiev and Hyderabad. It employs more than 160 people, most of them based in Dublin.It's an amazing story. Sysnet has grown from about €1m in revenue six years ago to over €20m in revenue this financial year. In the process Moynagh has twice been nominated for an 'Entrepreneur of the Year' award in the international category and the company has also won a slew of industry awards.He's modest enough to admit however that "the heaviest lifting is done off the ground" - and that initial push came from his father, Tom, who started Sysnet in 1989."He moved to New York in the early 1970s, went to college there and came back to Ireland in 1981. He was one of the first working in the whole IT sector in Ireland."He worked in virtual reality for a while and silicon graphics. The main business was IT support and service. So they'd go into high street retailers and sell them hardware and then sell them the support contract to go with the hardware."Their own customers were asking them more and more about internet security and so they started dabbling in that. There was also another side to the business - Computer Aided Design (CAD) and they worked that for a while. We began focussing on information security."Moynagh was, by his own account, not very academic as a youngster - he went to St Columba's College in Rathfarnham - and studied zoology in UCD, which hardly boded well for a future in business. However, he started working in the company for his father and gradually climbed the ladder through various roles until becoming CEO four years ago. He presents the dynamic within Sysnet as a push-pull between him and his father."We would have had a lot of arguments. Now I look back and think we actually needed that. It gave us a balance. I was trying to do too much too fast."We had various roles in the company but there wasn't really a hierarchy. It was everyone else and then my Dad. I may have pulled the son card once or twice but I don't remember."In 2007, he and his father were advised by Brian Caulfield at Trinity that developing their own software would greatly enhance their chances of securing investment."We began development and subsequently won a tender with a UK bank to deliver our new software to 35,000 small businesses. This deal helped us secure funding with a US private equity firm called GTX."The software was designed to tackle the emergence of increasingly high profile security breaches in the credit card industry."The main one that stands out was CardSystems in the US in 2005. Millions of people's data was stolen," he recalls. "Those card numbers end up online for sale. Hackers go for the most valuable thing they can find - and in the right hands, card numbers are practically the equivalent of cash." (Visa and American Express would go on to drop CardSystems as a credit card processing company.)Sysnet only contracts with the acquirer and the relationship between it and its stable of merchants remains unchanged. Perhaps most importantly they don't at any point take ownership of the merchant data they gather during the process. It belongs to the acquirer and they use it however they see fit."The way it works is that the credit card giants have a network of vast institutions called the acquiring bank," he explains. "These acquiring banks have a relationship with the merchant. The acquiring bank is responsible for these merchants - and when a rule is established it's up to them to implement it."Visa and Mastercard, for example, don't have a direct relationship with the merchant - they go through the acquiring bank."And they said to us: these high profile breaches are happening and we need to restore consumer confidence and make sure systems were secure. They were also trying to show that they are self regulating. They were also trying to create an industry standard."That industry standard that emerged was called PCI DSS (Moynagh admits his industry has "an acronym at every turn") and Sysnet's ability to implement it placed it suddenly at the vanguard."One of the turning points for us was when I was in the office upstairs in Churchtown and we got a call from Conor McGovern at Realex Payments asking about this standard and whether we provided PCI," he recalls."At the time there were only two or three companies that actually had the credentials from Visa or Mastercard to go into a large financial institution and audit them. We went through a lot of hoops to become a certified security assessor."Once we got that badge we went from where we weren't winning tenders to all of a sudden winning them. We were the first in Ireland and the fourth in Europe, so we began getting government tenders."Moving outside Ireland was a big psychological barrier, but we knew we had to do it to grow."Their first big software deal came with Bank of Scotland Merchant Services, which was due to triple the size of the company but it almost didn't get off the ground."Toward the eleventh hour it still wasn't working. And I clearly remember thinking: 'That was it, we had our chance and now it's gone.' We had people working until after midnight every night to get it over the line."The deal made Sysnet a software company and gave them a platform to grow into a global business."The temptation was to only go after the Tescos, the Ryanairs and the Aer Linguses of the world - but the acquiring banks were under pressure not to forget about the higher risk portfolio."Hotels and hospitality are at a high risk of data compromise. Ecommerce merchants are also very vulnerable. They had to look like they were doing something about it. From 2005 they were also coming under pressure from regulators."While the increased emphasis on security within the credit card industry and the need for self regulation played into Moynagh's hands, there were also a few serendipitous coincidences that smoothed his company's path to success."My whole family are big into Irish music," he explains. "But most of them are better at it than I am. I play the fiddle."In 2009, my sister Lindsay was a musician in a traditional Irish music show that had received funding from a US investor after he attended the first performance while holidaying in Galway."Anyway, he turned out to be the former CEO of an American and European payments company which - through pure luck - was Sysnet's second largest client. He subsequently funded Sysnet and it really was an incredible coincidence. We had at that time been trying to raise money in the company."Lindsay - who also worked in the company for a while - still lords it over me to this day because of that."So what does the future hold for him and Sysnet?"We have a huge portfolio of small businesses that rely on us to get them through the PCI process. Our challenge now is to develop software that will help them with that process."Will they be acquiring other companies?"In the future the company will be looking to invest in acquiring companies that are developing security systems which are aimed at PCI compliance. We took a 25pc stake in a company called iScan which does just that. We want to prove that the distribution requirement is there. I'd rather prove that the distribution works before buying a company."Although the security industry isn't as vulnerable as some to fluctuations in the economy led by flip-flopping consumer sentiment, Gabriel believes the future has begun looking brighter lately and another jobs announcement is imminent."We'll be working with over a million merchants through a handful of financial institutions. There will be another job announcement pretty soon. We are finalising our financial year this month."We've gone through a really deep strategic process and once we're through that we'll know more. We're still playing with what holes we need to fill. We've got to a point where it's not enough to be just entrepreneurial."And with that it's back to the hospital. I've taken enough time already. And Moynagh has another long day of waiting ahead of him.If I could look back to myself when I was starting out I'd tell myself… "I wish I'd gotten started earlier. I feel more confident now that I've made a lot of mistakes. When we were growing quickly I made hiring choices based on need. We now hire for strength as opposed to lack of weakness."The brokest I've ever been was… "there were a couple of times with the company when we were close to not being able to pay wages. In terms of me personally, probably when I was in college although I always worked in bars and restaurants so I made tips there."Outside the company my favourite investments are… "it's part of my contract that I don't invest. There are some of the companies we work with that I'd love to invest in."I've had to stand up to my Dad… "tons of times! All along when cash-flow was tight, it was always me trying to speed up and him trying to slow down. I would never have admitted he was right at the time because I thought everything I was trying to do was genius."
Mary Lou MacDonald has been defending the indefensible - or Gerry Adams, as he's better known - for months now.Chances are that the Sinn Fein deputy leader will need to do so again in the near future, as her boss's mouth still appears not to be on communicating terms with his brain.No wonder Mary Lou decided that enough was enough, and that it was about time for colleagues in SF to start coming out to bat for her too. All week they've been loyally popping up on the airwaves to insist that the party's deputy leader was entirely correct last December to use the sanctuary of the Dail to name those she accused of having offshore Ansbacher accounts, despite her actions being censured last week as a breach of the rules by the Oireachtas Committee on Procedures and Privilege.Those allegations, said the report issued by committee, were "in the nature of being defamatory". There's nothing like a euphemism. It's a bit like saying that calling someone a worthless, despicable son of a, er, gun was "in the nature of being impolite".SF's defence of all this is that it was "in the public interest". What? Even if the allegations are untrue, as those named in the chamber before Christmas have all stated?Three of them - former PD leader Des O'Malley; former EU commissioner Maire Geoghegan-Quinn; former finance minister Ray MacSharry - publicly denied having offshore Ansbacher accounts. A fourth - former Tanaiste Mary Harney - just as strenuously denies Mary Lou's allegation that she shut down a probe into such accounts.The best defence to the criticism that she shouldn't have named these people under Dail privilege would be to assert that she had no other option because the allegations are true, and, by the way, here's the proof. The best defence is not to say, as Mary Lou did, that she was permitted to do so under Standing Order 59 on the grounds of "reasonable excuse, responsible exercise, good faith and sound basis."Here's the thing. Most of us out here haven't got a clue what Standing Order 59 is. If we're honest, we don't really care either. We just kinda, sorta want to know if what you're saying is true or not, and whether you're either going to stand over, or withdraw, it. The rest of the excuses merely sound like white noise.The key detail in last week's events is the line which ended all newspaper reports on the matter: "Mary Lou McDonald could not be reached for a comment." The SF deputy leader has been harder to find in recent days than Wally. They should bring out a new series of books to boost the party's coffers: Where's Mary-Lou? Obviously publishers would have to put her in green and orange stripes, rather than Wally's trademark red and white, to counter charges that she's turned into a West Brit, but it could be a winner.It's only a suggestion, but have people thought of looking in the prawn section of her local supermarket? She's previously been quite happy to be approached there by the media.McDonald contented herself instead with issuing a statement, standing by her decision - which made a change from standing by her leader, to be fair - but it hardly answered remaining questions.That was left to colleagues such as Pearse Doherty, who drew the short straw on Thursday's News At One on RTE Radio One. The finance spokesman did his best, insisting, for example, that Mary Lou should have been afforded the opportunity to address the committee personally.Indeed she should have. Which probably explains why she was. When this was pointed out to him, Doherty diplomatically said that this was perhaps a matter which Mary Lou was best placed to clear up, but that she was abroad. Offshore, one might almost say. Now there's irony.Of course, she could prove that she has the courage of her convictions by coming out onto the steps of the Dail and simply repeating the allegations. That would give the subjects of her claims the chance to defend their good names in the courts.Whilst vilifying the media for its coverage of that issue, SF TDs appear unwilling to subject themselves to the same rules. How convenient.
Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers celebrates with Liverpool's Jordan Henderson after the final whistle during the FA Cup Sixth Round Replay match at Ewood Park, BlackburnBRENDAN RODGERS insists Liverpool will always be a “huge attraction” for players whether the club finishes in the top four this season or not.But the Reds boss concedes that Champions League football is key to their ambitions going forward, and admits that every player wants to be playing on that stage.Liverpool’s hopes of being involved in next season’s competition look slim at best right now. A seven point gap to fourth-placed Manchester City, as well as a vastly-inferior goal difference, looks a big one with only seven league games remaining.Such a situation has inevitably led to fears, among Reds fans, that they will be unable to attract the kind of players who will help them challenge at the top end of the Premier League.Rodgers, though, says Liverpool will always appeal to players, and believes the club’s reputation for developing players will help them when it comes to bringing signings in.“We always have to try and get in the best players that we possibly can,” he said. “And I think that Liverpool will always be an attractive offer for players, whether we are in the Champions League or not.“Of course, people look at it and think that you can’t attract people when you’re not in the Champions League, but Liverpool will always be a huge attraction.“That’s because of the history and tradition of the club, but also, I believe, because of how we work here. People look at us and see a team and a squad that is evolving and, I believe, will want to be a part of that.“It’s natural that every player, or every manager, would love to work in the Champions League. We were in it this year, and we felt the competition. We loved our involvement in it, and we want to be in it consistently over a number of years. If it’s not to be this year, then we are going to fight very hard next year.“Most players I speak to, they want to play at that level, but they also want to know that their game is improving, and that they are getting the opportunity to play football. It boils down to that, as well as the other things.“This is one of the greatest clubs in the world, and it will always be an attraction for players.”Rodgers publicly stated that Liverpool’s top-four hopes were all but over after the 4-1 defeat to Arsenal last weekend, and found himself back in the spotlight in the days that followed.He was forced to deny reports of dressing-room unrest in the aftermath of that Emirates loss, and knows that had his side not beaten Blackburn Rovers in their FA Cup quarter-final replay on Wednesday, the pressure would have been cranked up another notch.The Ulsterman, though, says such pressure is par for the course for a Liverpool manager.“Listen, if you manage a big club, that’s what comes with it. That’s what is expected,” he said.“Our performance level, and how we have been working, demonstrated how well we had been playing, but then obviously we lost two games and we were criticised.“That’s the nature of being at a big club. However it (criticism) comes, I always say, whether it’s deserved or undeserved, you won’t like it but you’ve got to find the solutions and the ideas to get back winning again. That’s what we did, and will look to continue.”A general view of Wembley Stadium from Wembley WayThat will begin against Newcastle at Anfield on Monday night, before Liverpool head for Wembley and their FA Cup semi final with Aston Villa.Victory there would give Rodgers his first major final as a manager and would, in his opinion, underline the development of his young team.He said: “It shows the steps that we have made in the last couple of years.“With very young players, a very young team with lots of transitions, we took the title down to the very last game of last season. Our objective this year, clearly, was to challenge for trophies. And now we’re in our second semi-final.“It shows there is progress, and I think the players here know that progress is being made. For us, it is just about reinforcing that and then making the next step.“Of course when you don’t have players with great experience, it takes a wee bit longer. But sometimes you’ve got to go through bad times, or lose important games, in order to become a winner.“For us, it was very clear that the objective this year was to win a trophy, and as you can see we are doing everything we can, and the players are putting themselves in the positions to compete for these things.“If we win, it will be another stride forward for us and then we can really hopefully push on in every competition next year.”
General : Two people die in Mombasa following a cholera outbreakTwo people among them a one and a half year old baby have died in Mombasa County following the outbreak of cholera. The relatives of the deceased say the incident occurred after the victims ate food at a local kiosk in Likoni area before they started vomiting and diarrhoea. Dr. Said Mohamed of coast general hospital told NTV that the baby's father is also admitted at the hospital and is responding to medication.

THE roar erupted from the crowd packed outside Dunblane Cathedral yesterday as if Andy Murray had just won another Wimbledon.But this time the tennis superstar has won something much more important.His beautiful bride Kim Sears was by his side as they emerged from tying the knot yesterday to bask in the goodwill and good wishes of his home town.The champion tennis player has always been the prince of the Stirlingshire town.And the fans who’ve cheered him on ­throughout his career came out in force to wish him luck for the biggest match of his life.Andy tied the knot with Kim, his girlfriend of 10 years, as hundreds lined the streets around the 12th century cathedral.His past, her future, their present all wrapped up in a surge of love and affection on the tennis star’s home turf.Excitement has been building all week in the place Andy left as a young man.Every shop along the high street and every conversation yesterday was dominated by the wedding of the year. No, make that the ­wedding of the decade.“He brought thousands of tiny tennis balls with him,” said Audrey Melrose, 54, from Dunblane, as the hailstones fell.All day, blue sky turned to grey and back to blue again.Andy made his way into the cathedral from the front as fans from home and ­further afield tried to catch a glimpse of the man of the moment.One of Andy Murray’s old teachers was among the people lining the streets of tiny Kinbuck, near Cromlix hotel, where the couple celebratred their reception.Ann Hale joined friends and fellow ­Kinbuck residents Christine Durnan and Barbara Young to give the couple a wave as they drove through the village en route to the venue.Kinbuck is just a couple of miles north of Dunblane – and only a minute down the road from Cromlix.Ann, Christine and Barbara made a banner wishing the new couple good luck – and enjoyed a glass of champage as they drove past.Ann, who taught history at Dunblane High School said: “Both Andy and his brother Jamie were lovely boys.“Their mum Judy, was very supportive towards the school.“We thought we would come out today and wave and raise a glass to Kim and Andy as the drove past.“We’re all very proud of what Andy has achieved and we all wish them the very best for the future.”The sun shone brightly and Andy looked handsome in a kilt. Brother Jamie wore a matching outfit.Three bridesmaids got out of their Bentley with Kim’s mum Leonnie to cheers and applause. All wore dusky pink gowns. Two had shawls and one wore a feather boa.Kim, who looked ­breathtaking in his her white gown, was forced to hotfoot it through a side entrance as the heavens opened up and soaked well-wishers.As she stepped out of a silver Rolls Royce, her bridesmaids rushed to make sure her dress didn’t touch the ground.A white brolly – which they used to try and protected the bride from the rain – buckled under a stong gust of wind by the time she reached the door. However the gloomy weather wasn’t enough to dampen the feel-good factor which close to fever pitch.At one point, the weather was so bad that Dunblane Sports Club – where Andy played as a youngster – was covered in snow.Tennis coach Fiona Bennie,51, said: “We could write another good luck message in the snow. I was dying to see Kim. She’s beautiful.”It was possible to count on one hand the number of shops on the High Street that hadn’t turned their displays over to Andy and Kim.Cards, dresses, good luck messages, bunting and pictures all helped to express the goodwill felt for the local hero and his bride.Even the local cafe owner tried to pass off the tomato and basil soup as “Andy Murray” tomato and basil soup.“There are a few boxes of confetti left,” said Peter Meldrum in his local newsagents.“I’ve had a few of the guests in over the week. They’re very taken with Dunblane. It has been great for the town.”The pub closest to the cathedral was bustling with punters. Some no doubt reminiscing about their own big days. But others were there just to catch a glimpse of Andy and Kim.Audrey Currie,49, travelled two hours from Castle Douglas with her husband Eric,49, for the wedding.She said: “I got an early 50th birthday gift of a trip to Wimbledon last year and I saw Andy on Court One. So travelling two hours up the road was easy.Plenty did. Plenty more wiped away a tear and even more cheered for ­Scotland’s royal couple.Everyone agreed it was a wedding to suit everyone.Lavish is not often used to describe Andy’s taste – after all, he marked one birthday in Burger King.But it was the wedding that had captured the nation’s heart.It arrived a little faster than a second British Wimbledon winner since Fred Perry.Bells chimed at 5.38pm to let the the waiting crowds know that the happy couple were on their way.And if this match is anything to go by it’ll almost certainly be a happy ever after.Try your hand at our showbiz quiz
The leaders of the US and Cuba have held their first formal meeting in more than half a century - clearing the way for a thawing of relations that seemed unthinkable to citizens of both countries only a few years ago.US President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro met in a small conference room in Panama, where they sat side by side.Mr Obama said the event was "obviously a historic meeting", adding that his country was ready to "turn the page" with Cuba on the past.He said: "It was my belief it was time to try something new, that it was important for us to engage with Cuban government. And, more importantly, with Cuban people."He thanked Mr Castro for his "spirit of openness" but warned that significant differences still remain.Mr Castro said he was ready to discuss issues such as human rights and press freedom, saying: "Everything can be on the table."But he warned that the two countries may "agreed to disagree" at times, adding that both sides must be "very patient".The meeting was held on the sideline of the Summit of the Americas, which this year included Cuba for the first time.It was not publicly announced in advance but White House officials had suggested the two leaders were hoping for an opportunity to meet while in Panama.The meeting came just hours after the two shared a handshake as the summit opened.Four months ago Mr Castro and Mr Obama simultaneously announced an ending of hostilities.It is expected that the US will soon agree to remove Cuba's name from its list of state sponsors of terrorism, something that would also open the door to loans and aid for the South American nation after decades of suffering under the trade embargo.Fidel Castro came to power in 1959 after overthrowing the US-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista.For half a century, the leader of the first communist country in the western hemisphere was a thorn in America's side.In 2006, after abdominal surgery, he started the transfer of power to his brother Raul, who took the landmark step in 2014 of appearing with the US  President.
Cord leader Raila Odinga and his co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka now want President Barack Obama and the US government to support the push to have Kenyan soldiers withdrawn from Somalia.Mr Odinga and Mr Musyoka, who held talks with two US senators that are part of a delegation visiting the country, pleaded for total American support for the campaign to have Kenyan troops, who are part of an African Union force, leave Somalia.US senators Chris Coons of Delaware and his New York counterpart Kristen Gillibrand met the two opposition leaders at a dinner hosted by Mr Odinga at his Karen home. Al-Shabaab has been giving the presence of the Kenya Defence Forces in Somalia as an excuse to carry out attacks across the border.The most recent, and one of the deadliest in Kenya’s history, was the killing of 148 people at Garissa University College on April 2. Kenyan forces entered Somalia in October 2011.The meeting came as Deputy President William Ruto said the government had given the United Nations a three-month ultimatum to close Dadaab refugee complex in north-eastern Kenya, which mostly hosts Somali refugees.Mr Ruto said the Jubilee government had started talks with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to shut down the camp. If no agreement is reached the government would use force to close down the vast camps in Dadaab.The Un refugee agency said in February there were at least 335,000 refugees in the camp, but some reports say they are close to 500,000.“If the UN does not move them within the next three months, we will go there with buses and lorries and remove them,” Mr Ruto said.The DP spoke during the opening of a technical training institute in Mukurwe-ini. He said the government would be seeking the approval of Parliament to allocate more resources to the Security docket.“We will do whatever it takes to secure our country even if it means losing business with Somalia. Our aim is to make the country secure for our people,” he said.This comes in the week in which the building of a wall between Mandera and Somalia along the Kenya-Somali boarder started. The Somali government has protested that it was not consulted. The wall seeks to deter terrorists from crossing into Kenya from the war-damaged country to breed extremists.“The same way 9/11 changed America is the way the shooting of the university students will change Kenya,” he said.In Nairobi, the two opposition leaders told the American lawmakers that Kenyan casualties in the battle to secure Somalia had reached unimaginable figures and caused deep pain.The Kenyan leaders asked the US to rally the international community to push for other countries to move into Somalia so Kenya Defence Forces can pull out.“We moved in there out of frustration and a feeling that the international community was too slow. Our position in Opposition that we now need to retreat and secure our borders,” Mr Odinga said.
Trucks and heavy commercial vehicles passing through Nairobi from east to west will from next week on Friday be banned from using Mombasa Road and Waiyaki Way during the day.This comes after new measures to tame traffic jams in the city that saw the closure of five roundabouts and right turns on a number of junctions this week appear not to have yielded the desired results.“The reason why bypasses were constructed was to prevent trucks from passing though the city centre and it is time they were put to use,” said the governor.The Southern Bypass, which is still incomplete, would be upgraded between Ole Sereni Hotel and Langata Road in order to make it motorable when the new rule takes effect.The road is among at least five others that are bearing the brunt of increased traffic following the introduction of the no right turn rule.Worst affected are residents from Eastlands and the Southern sections of Nairobi  who have been forced to bear with increased traffic as more vehicles divert to these areas in order to escape the gridlock on Mombasa Road and Waiyaki Way following the introduction of the no right turn rule.The two roads, which cut across the capital, serve as the main entrance and exits points to the city from upcountry and the Coast. Any significant increase or decrease in traffic flow affects the four other main tributaries, Ngong, Langata, Thika and Jogoo roads, bringing the capital city to a near standstill.For instance, a number of motorists coming to town this week from Mombasa Road were diverted at City Cabanas on to Outering Road and then Jogoo Road in an effort to escape the traffic.Others have been using the Southern Bypass, on to Langata Road before Joining Mbagathi Way and Valley Road in order to reach the city centre, putting pressure on these roads which are themselves notorious for traffic jams.In addition since vehicles headed to Rongai and Langata can no longer join Langata Road at the Nyayo Stadium roundabout most of them opt to join the road using Ngong Road into Mbagathi road instead of going all the way to South B flyover and then turning back two kilometres if they were to use Mombasa road.“The jam you are seeing is caused by lack of courtesy and bad driving habits. Let us give it time; once people get used to the new systems, traffic will flow smoothly,” said Dr Kidero.However, this decision has faced resistance from Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko who insisted that the national and county governments should consider starting the elevated highway instead of using shortcuts.“During the Tenth Parliament of which I was an MP, the World Bank gave money to construct an overpass from Westlands to the Airport but it stalled because of integrity issues and acquisition of land for the project; this is what the government needs to be looking at,” he told the Sunday Nation.Construction of the elevated highway was to start in 2013 at a cost of $200 million funded by the World Bank. The project failed after the bank pulled out over concerns about Strabag, a consortium selected by the government that was to build the express highway and collect fees for use on a 30-year concession deal.
UPDATE: POLICE are investigating a serious four vehicle traffic crash that occurred in Gootchie earlier yesterday.Investigations suggest around 10.30am, a sedan was travelling southbound along the Bruce Highway, 20km south of Tiaro before it crossed to the other side of the road before hitting a second sedan.As a result of the collision, the second sedan collided with a guard rail and then ricocheted to the opposite side of the road before colliding with the rear of a trailer being towed by a truck and then head-on into a third sedan.READ MORE OF THE LATEST QUEENSLAND NEWSThe 48-year-old male driver of the second sedan was taken to Gympie Hospital in a serious condition while the 45-year-old female passenger was flown to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in a critical condition.A 16-year-old female passenger of the third sedan was flown to Nambour Hospital in a serious condition while a 17-year-old female passenger was transported to Gympie Hospital with minor injuries.The Bruce Highway at the incident location was closed for approximately four and a half hours.Investigations into the crash are continuing.YESTERDAY: Two people have been airlifted to hospital after a four-car crash at Gootchie, south of Tiaro, with one woman in a critical condition.The RACQ Careflight and EMQ rescue helicopters flew to the scene of the crash, which happened about 10.30am on Saturday.The flight doctor and flight intensive care paramedics worked to stabilise the woman before airlifting her to the Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital in a critical condition.Speaking at the scene, Sergeant Steve Webb from the Wide Bay Forensic Crash Unit said investigators already had a clear idea of how the crash had unfolded."The initial inquiries show that a black sedan that was travelling southbound  has drifted on the incorrect side of the road and collided with a blue sedan that was travelling northbound."That sedan in turn has collided with another southbound sedan and somewhere in the mix someone has hit a semi-trailer and caused relatively minor damage to that vehicle."Sgt Webb said several people involved in the crash had sustained serious injuries."Well at this stage the people in the blue car behind me have been taken to hospital. The passenger is in a critical condition. The other is in a serious condition and another young woman is in a serious condition as well.When asked if those involved in the crash were lucky to have escaped with their lives, Sgt Webb replied "well yes - at this stage"."One's been flown to Brisbane," he said."It could have been a lot worse."Sgt Webb said he made no apologies for closing the highway for a few hours to deal with the aftermath of the crash."We've got to gather our evidence," he said."Unfortunately that's the nature of driving on the road nowadays."If something like this happens, you'll have to wait, I make no apologies for it."Sgt Webb said he could preach road safety until he was blue in the face."I mean, what have I got to say?" he said."This is the second serious crash I've been to in a week."We send out the same message all the time."You know, these tragedies are avoidable."The highway remains closed in both directions.EARLIER YESTERDAY: A serious four-vehicle traffic crash at Gootchie has closed the Bruce Hwy in both directions.The crash happened on the Oaky Creek Bridge, near the intersection of Deveron Rd , about 15km south of Tiaro.The highway will be closed for several hours and motorists are being advised to seek alternative routes.Please note: police information initially indicated that three cars were involved.

Members of the Siaya County Assembly on Saturday rejected a condolence message sent by President Uhuru Kenyatta to the family of a Garissa attack victim.Speaking at the burial of Prisca Auma Wayodi, who was pursuing a degree in Education Arts, the ward representatives described Mr Kenyatta’s letter as an insult to families of the victims.Siaya Deputy County Commissioner Peter Jumwa then gave the letter to Prisca’s parents without reading it.Mr James Obiero Otare (Siaya Township), Leonard Oriaro (Central Alego) and Mr Christopher Apiyo of South Uyoma asked the President to resign for failing to protect Kenyans.“We do not want the President’s speech to be read to the public since he is the one who has failed to provide Kenyans with adequate security,” said Mr Otare.The ward reps criticised Jubilee’s Nyumba Kumi security plan, saying it had failed before it could be launched. Mr Oriaro asked the government to fully devolve security to the counties.Prisca’s father Thomas Wayodi, a teacher at Rarieda Uyore Primary School, eulogised his daughter as an industrious, hardworking and aggressive young woman.
Brendan Rodgers insists that top players still regard Liverpool as an elite force in world football.The Reds’ quest for a Champions League place and FA Cup glory has been clouded by their failure to persuade Raheem Sterling to sign a new contract. And in recent years, Fernando Torres and Luis Suarez have made big-money departures to further their ambitions.After losing out to Arsenal in the race to sign Alexis Sanchez last year, Liverpool’s chances of landing stellar names this summer to offset the loss of Steven Gerrard will fade further if they are unable to clinch a place in the Premier League’s top four.But Rodgers said: “Liverpool will always be an attractive offer for players, whether we are in the Champions League or not. People think you cannot attract players if you are not in the Champions League, but Liverpool will always be a huge attraction.“That’s not just because of the history of the club, but also because of what we are trying to do here. Players will look at us and see a team and squad evolving, and they will want to be a part of that.”The one that got away: Sanchez could have played FOR Liverpool at Arsenal last weekLiverpool face Newcastle at Anfield on Monday, desperately clinging on to the hope that they can overhaul at least one of the Manchester clubs after defeats to United and Arsenal put an end to an impressive surge to the top four.But after clinching a Wembley semi-final date with Aston Villa by beating Blackburn in midweek, Rodgers believes his side can prove in the coming weeks that they are still a force.Rodgers said: “It’s natural that every player, coach and manager would love to work in the Champions League. There are players here who spent a long time not being in the Champions League.“We were in it this year, we loved the competition, and we want to be there consistently over a number of years. Most players, of course, want to play at that level, but they also want to know their game is improving and they will get the opportunity to play football.“It boils down to that, as well as the other things.“But this is one of the greatest clubs in the world and this club will always be an attraction for a player.”He added: “We took the title down to the very last game of last season and our objective this time has been to challenge for trophies. We are now in our second semi-final of the season, and I think that shows we are making progress.“All the players here believe there is progress being made, but we don’t have many players with great experience, so sometimes winning things takes a wee bit longer.“Sometimes you have to go through bad times or lose important games in order become a winner.”
Health insurers are making one last push to get thousands of younger people to sign up by again cutting the cost of cover and offering discounts for those in their 20s.New late-entry levies on health insurance policies will kick in after the end of this month. This will see those over the age of 34 paying penalties on their premiums if they take out health insurance for the first time.The four health insurers are now hoping that up to 60,000 people will be forced to take out health cover for the first time to avoid the penalties.In a bid to capture the new recruits, two of the insurers have cut the cost of entry-level policies.Laya Healthcare is launching Assure First at a cost of €395 per adult, with free cover for children, according to broker Dermot Goode of TotalHealthCover.ie. The plan covers all public hospitals, but not private ones. Most entry-level plans only cover a select number of public hospitals.And GloHealth has just lunched Base Lite which costs €394 a year for adults and covers most public hospitals.The plan includes a semi-private room in selected public hospitals, but subscribers must pay the hospital bill first and claim the cost back off the insurer, Mr Goode said.All four insurers are now offering discounts of up to 50pc for those in their 20s, he said.From the start of May, discounts of 50pc will be on offer for 21-year-olds, falling to 10pc for 25-year-olds.A change in the law last year means insurers can offer discounts to those in their 20s.Mr Goode added: "Student rates are being abolished, but there will still be reduced pricing available from all insurers for adults between 18 and 20."There are just two weeks left before new penalties come in for those who leave it until they are over 34 to take out cover for the first time.Health insurers have yet to see a surge in new business, but Mr Goode said he did not expect a rise in premiums if an avalanche of new members fails to materialise.And he warned that the new entry-level schemes are not high-quality insurance plans.Many of these plans do not cover all public hospitals, so consumers need to ensure their preferred hospital is on the list."Basically, the insurers have stripped everything possible off these plans to achieve these rates. If your sole objective is to avoid the loadings, then you should consider one of the entry-level plans," Mr Goode said.He added that the new low-cost plans cover the public hospital charge of €75 per night, which is a maximum of €750 every 12 months.The new entry-level plans also cover the private charge in public hospitals of €813 per night. But those who want quality cover for public and private hospitals would need to spend at least €890 a year per adult, he said.
Chairman of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) Technical and Development Committee, Felix Anyansi-Agwu has expressed joy in the qualifications of the U-23 National Team and the Senior Women’s Team for both the football event of this year’s All Africa Games.Siasia’s U23 edged Zambia 2-1 in Lusaka on Sunday to qualify for the Men’s Football Tournament of the Games on a 2-1 aggregate, two days after the Super Falcons had whipped their counterparts from Mali 8-0 in Abuja to reach the women’s event on 9-1 aggregate.The member of the NFF Executive Committee was delighted as both teams returned to the football events of the continental Games, from which they were missing four years ago.“You will remember very well that four years ago, none of the two teams made it to the All-Africa Games held in Mozambique. Their qualification this time, coming within two days of each other, speaks volumes. This is also a sign of the good and great things coming very soon to Nigeria football,” said Anyansi-Agwu.“I want to put these feats down to the exceptional leadership style of the NFF President, Mr. Amaju Melvin Pinnick, who has continuously harped on the need to build sustainable football culture as well as earn good results on the international front, and has been leading us all to work assiduously in that direction.”
Florida Senator Marco Rubio has announced his bid for the Republican nomination in the 2016 US presidential election race.Speaking at a rally in Miami, he said the presidential election was "a generational choice" and warned against going back to "the leaders and ideas of the past".
The country's most senior woman banker is moving on. Ulster Bank's Ellvena Graham has called it a day after 33 years with the bank she joined in Belfast in 1982 straight out of school.Testament to her advanced multi-tasking skills, the departing woman will be replaced by two men.Ellvena Graham worked most recently as managing director of SME Banking for Ulster Bank as a whole and as the bank's Northern Ireland head.As the public face of Ulster Bank in the North she took the heat at Stormont over the bank's botched communication of major job cuts last year, a crisis she diffused with clarity and an apology. She is off to pursue other interests and will join Ulster Bank's board as a non executive director in the coming months.Richard Donnan is taking over as managing director of Ulster's SME, corporate and institutional business in Northern Ireland, in addition to his current responsibility for retail banking nationally, and Eddie Cullen will take over the SME business in the Republic, where he is already responsible for corporate and institutional banking.Would you like to work in the financial services industry? You might want to think again, because, according to a recent survey, the work is boring, wages are stagnant and your co-workers are less than inspiring.The study by Options Group, the findings of which were published by the 'Financial Times' yesterday, showed that just one-fifth of those who took part said they were content with their job. Gordon Gekko stuff it ain't, it seems. Half of the 100 people that were interviewed, who were mostly in senior positions in banks and stockbrokers, said there were roundly unhappy.The survey, now in its fifth year, has produced consistently downbeat findings amid mass job cuts and a big regulatory squeeze since the crisis, said Jessica Lee, an Options Group director"In an environment where pay and bonus pools are stagnant, brute politics and internal credit-stealing are ascendant," one anonymous investment banker was quoted as saying.Other reasons for low job satisfaction included a proliferation of rules turning brokers into "utilities" and "greedy senior managers" that are only interested in protecting their own perks.Pick a career in journalism instead. Your co-workers will be terribly charming.Who doesn't love a pint of Guiness? Nothing is quite as associated with Irish-ness and our diddly dee image abroad as a good 'ol pint of the Black Stuff, to be sure to be sure, meaning that the power of the Guiness brand has long been coveted as a sponsor.It would come as no surprise to the majority then that Guinness has emerged as Ireland's most appealing sponsor so far in 2015.The finding was made in the latest release of the quarterly Irish public sponsorship pulse from Dublin-based sponsorship agency Onside,Guiness beat off competition from the likes of Vodafone, SuperValu, AIB and Bank of Ireland to claim the top spot.One in 10 of the public named the brand as the best sponsor in the market in the year's first quarter.With rugby clearly at play in the sponsor line-up revealed by the latest Onside public survey, Pro12 and 6 Nations sponsor Guinness was also joined by 3Mobile, Aviva and RBS/Ulster Bank in terms of appealing most to the Irish public.Despite some strong rivals also vying for the number one spot, it comes as no surprise to the Punt that Guiness managed to top the pile in terms of coveted sponsors.Despite the fact that its creator, Arthur Guinness, was a committed Unionist and the company considered disassociating itself from its Irish reputation as recently as the 1980s, shure didn't O'Bama himself give his pint the thumbs up when he visited in 2012, begorrah!
'It's a disgrace, Joe. I'm sitting here in central Dublin on my pathetic 150Mbs broadband service. When are they upgrading us to the 1,000Mbs speeds that the fat cats in Cavan and Athlone and Portlaoise have? How long do we have to suffer this two-tier broadband society?"It may seem an unlikely complaint. But it is a quirk of the regional fibre broadband arms race that a million people in 50 towns outside Dublin and Cork will soon have access to far faster broadband than their city cousins.Make no mistake about it: the fibre-to-the-home broadband that will be launched to 500,000 homes and businesses around the country over the coming months and years will make our present city connections look quaint.There'll even be competition. Eircom is dead set on going toe-to-toe with the ESB-Vodafone joint venture's fibre launches in the same 50 towns. That means a choice of so-called 'gigabit' connections, the Holy Grail of strategic broadband planning in the globe's top internet countries.And there's serious investment, too. ESB-Vodafone (which doesn't have a trading name yet) is spending €450m. Eircom is spending its own €400m. And that's before the Government's (entirely separate) €500m National Broadband Plan, a pledge to connect every rural household to fibre broadband by 2020.That's a lot of money on a lot of fibre broadband over the next couple of years. And it's without counting a separate €600m investment plan to upgrade mobile networks to 4G.There's no let-up. ESB-Vodafone is talking about a further 300 towns and villages for the fibre service, work that could begin next year. Ironically, this could leave the Government with a strategic headache.If an additional 300 towns and villages are being considered in ESB-Vodafone's fibre plans, will those villages still be included in the state-subsidised National Broadband Plan rollout?The Government's 30Mbs rural broadband is only for areas not included in private operators' plans. One way or the other, residents outside cities look set to benefit.
A property company controlled by Galway developer John Lally has reduced the value of a site it bought for over €100m by a further €13m.The South Dublin site was reportedly bought for more than €100m by Brackville Holdings in 2006. Brackville is part of the Lalco group, which is controlled by Mr Lally.The company had planned to construct almost 600 apartments, a 189-bedroom hotel, offices and shops on the five-acre site that was formerly occupied by a company called FAAC Electronics in Sandyford. Brackville applied for planning permission from Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown county council in 2007, however the project failed to materialise.Brackville raised as much as €25m in equity from private clients of Goodbody Stockbrokers to finance the acquisition and planned development of the site.Accounts just filed by the company for the 12 months to the end of 2013 show that show that the company incurred a loss of €12.9m for the year.That brought the firm's net liability to €175.6m at the end of the period.Accounts filed for Brackville said: "The outlook for the property market has materially declined since the site was acquired and the value of the asset has declined."Brackville's loans were previously transferred to the loans have been transferred to the National Asset Management Agency (Nama). The company has now agreed a repayment plan with Nama that is set to conclude in 2020.The accounts say that the company is now working with both its lenders, Nama and Ulster Bank, and state that the company directors "believe it [Brackville] still has their continuing support".However, it noted that no formal financial commitment had been received from Ulster Bank at the time the accounts were filed. The accounts added that the value of the site should increase when planning permission is secured.In 2008, a unit of Irish Life sued Lalco's parent firm for its failure to complete a €74m purchase of a Dublin site in Sandyford for which a €15m deposit had been paid.Mr Lally also emerged in 2006 as having paid €25m to Renata Coleman for Humewood Castle in Co Wicklow.Mr Lally was unavailable for comment at the time of publication.
A cinema equipment supply company is suing a number of companies in the Irish Multiplex Cinemas (IMC) group over alleged failure to pay for equipment including projectors, sound systems and 3D systems.Cinetech, Ballycoolin, Dublin, has brought the action against IMC Tallaght, Dundalk Multiplex Cinemas; IMC (Mullingar), Galway Multiplex, Laguna Entertainments and IMC.An application to have the case admitted to the High Court's fast track Commercial Court list was refused by Judge Brian McGovern after he ruled he was exercising his discretion to do so on grounds of delay by Cinetech in bringing the case. It now proceeds through the normal High Court list.In an affidavit, Cinetech company secretary Alan Godden says his company has been providing equipment to the IMC group since 2001.The group is run by a number of individuals including Paul Ward and Lorcan Ward, he says.He says among the debts owed are €483,000 from the Tallaght company, some €426,000 from IMC Ltd, and €260,000 from Galway Multiplex.
Apple has reportedly approached more than a dozen musicians, including British band Florence and the Machine, in an effort to sign exclusive deals for some of their music to be featured on Apple's new planned streaming service Beats.The company is in talks with Florence and the Machine to give Apple limited streaming rights to a track from their album set to be released in June, according to Bloomberg.Apple has also approached Taylor Swift and others about partnerships, the report said.Beats Music will be re-launched in coming months and will reportedly offer a $9.99-a-month subscription for individuals and a family plan for $14.99.
The big chill continues as an Antarctic air mass crosses New Zealand, but the snow and thunderstorms are set to ease.The cold snap shows how vulnerable New Zealand is to air masses coming up from the south, but was not an indication of a long hard winter, Meteorologist John Law said."This will be very short lived. If it was for a longer period, it would be more of an issue," he said.Snow fall this early in the year was certainly unusual, if not exceptional.Snow fell on State Highway 1 across the Desert Road overnight as temperatures in the lower North Island dropped to the coldest this year.Did you feel the chill?

Showers were lingering in southern parts of the region.Wellington woke to temperatures between 2C and 7C and a dusting of snow on the Tararua Ranges.Waiouru in the central North Island dropped to -1C, and snow on the nearby Desert Road was falling to as low as 600 metres above sea level and settling above 800m.Tuesday night and Wednesday morning are also expected to be cold before temperatures rise as the weekend approaches.While Waiouru recorded the coldest temperature in the North Island, Tekapo in the South Island recorded New Zealand's overnight low of -3C.Otago and Banks Peninsula had snow showers on Monday night, which are expected to ease on Tuesday.Christchurch dropped to 2C overnight, with snow settling in inland parts of Canterbury and Banks Peninsula, and the Southern Alps getting a fresh coating.Snow also settled in Methven overnight, while MetService said there snow was reported in other inland areas of Canterbury including Oxford, Darfield, Sheffield and Springfield.Showers are expected to continue in Christchurch on Tuesday morning accompanied by strong, cool southwesterlies and a high of 12C.The heaviest snowfalls are expected in Southland and southern parts of Fiordland and Otago, especially Clutha.Roads have been reopened around the lower South Island, including SH94 Te Anau to Milford South which was earlier closed owing to icy conditions, the NZ Transport Agency said.  Cautions were still in place for main roads around Queenstown, Invercargill, and Dunedin.
The playoffs may be a new season, but T. J. Brodie’s job will remain the same from the National Hockey League’s regular season: move the puck to the up to set up chances for the forwards and jump into the play when the opportunity arises.“This year we wanted to be offensive from the back end. That meant moving the puck to create chances and be the fourth guy. I think it’s worked out well for us,” said the 24-year-old, who has just wrapped up his fourth regular season on the Calgary Flames’ blueline.Like a lot of his teammates, Brodie makes his Stanley Cup debut on Wednesday when the Flames open the Western Conference quarter-finals in Vancouver against the Canucks. That debut comes after 266 regular season games played without experience the playoffs at all.Brodie is a crucial part of the Flames offence along from the blueline spot along with Dennis Wideman and Brodie’s injured regular partner, captain Mark Giordano. Brodie contributed 11 goals and 30 assists in 82 games and his goal output exceeded the nine he scored in total in his previous 185 games with the Flames.If head coach Bob Hartley’s plan this season was for the defence to be a big part of the offence, the statistics shows that happened. Wideman, Giordano and Brodie ranked fourth through sixth, respectively, in team scoring during the regular season, while Kris Russell was eighth.Nothing changes for the playoffs, said Brodie.“We don’t want to play on our heels, we want to play the same way we played all year because it’s the reason why we are here,” he said.“The plan is to make the other team to play a 200-foot game while we try to create offence when we can.”The only thing that changed for Brodie over the course of the season was his partner. With Giordano out, he’s been paired with Deryk Engelland, a 33-year-old veteran, who joined the Flames for 2014-15 after spending five seasons with the Pittsburgh Penguins.“Offensively things are the same, but changing sides going from right side to the left side was a bit of an adjustment,” he said. “There’s always things from that aspect that I can get better at and I can figure out over time and that’s what I’ve been trying to do.”With Brodie being offensive-minded, it means Engelland, then, is the stay-at-home guy.“(T.J.’s) been great all year and he’s an elite defenceman in this league and my game plan to try and give him as much space as I can and let him go to work,” he said.“He supports the rush 95 per cent of the time, so I have to try and give him a little bit of time and he’ll try to do the rest.”
A renewable energy group has labelled the loss of more than 900 jobs from the sector in WA "extremely disappointing".Figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) showed the number of full-time jobs in the industry in WA had dropped from 1,740 in 2011/12 to 820 in 2013/14.Nationally there had been a reduction of 2,300 jobs.The WA Renewable Energy Alliance said the impasse on the Federal Government's renewable energy target (RET) was almost entirely to blame for the job losses.The major parties are locked in a stand-off over lowering the target.Chairman Richard Harris said the uncertainty was holding up more than $1 billion of investment in WA over the next five years alone, along with thousands of jobs."The investment is ready to go and there are jobs ready to be created but we can't do anything until that impasse is sorted," he said.He said WA's renewable energy sector was going backwards, and that was a "shame"."There's huge opportunities in WA for solar, biomass and wind projects and moving beyond just having solar on rooftops to having large-scale solar projects powering our economy," he said.The ABS figures showed WA's solar industry lost 760 jobs between 2011/12 and 2013/14.Mr Harris said medium-sized solar companies were the most affected, as they had set up in the hope of expanding from the residential solar panel market into the commercial sector for large projects such as shopping centres and industrial buildings.However, he said businesses have had to let go of staff because the projects were not starting."Those companies that were geared up for growth on the basis of a bipartisan policy of a renewable energy target, that growth just is not there," he said.Mr Harris said while the RET was a federal issue, the State Government should be showing some leadership."We could have most of our energy coming from renewable energy sources in the next decade," he said."That's something the WA Government should be having a good look at."He said the downturn in mining was an opportunity for investment to be directed into clean energy.
INDYCAR officials say a pit crew member who was hit by a car Sunday during the inaugural IndyCar Grand Prix of Louisiana has received six stitches for a cut on his leg and has been released.Tire changer Todd Phillips, a front-outside tire changer for Dayle Coyne Racing, was sent flying when he was struck by the car of Francesco Dracone, who had come in on Lap 25 for tires and fuel.Dracone spun while exiting his put box, clipping Phillips’ leg. Phillips was taken to the infield care centre for treatment.Many cars struggled with traction during the race after rain had fallen for hours leading up to the green flag.Dracone did not finish the race and wound up 23rd.

West African civil society and human rights groups said the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has kept at least eight pro-democracy activists in secret detention for almost a month. The groups told reporters in Dakar Monday that the Congolese activists must either be formally charged before a judge or immediately released.Several dozen people were arrested in mid-March in Kinshasa and Goma in connection with a pro-democracy youth workshop in the capital. Some were released, but human rights group Amnesty International said others are still detained with no access to lawyers or family. No charges have been filed.At the time of the arrests, the government accused them of conspiring to "destabilize" the country.Amnesty’s Senegal Director, Seydi Gassama, said that accusation is “ridiculous” and “unfounded.” U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was a sponsor of the event in March, he said, and the government was invited.He said Africans should no longer accept this kind of oppression as an inevitability. In the case of the DRC, he said it is the freedom of expression and the freedom of assembly that are being challenged. Those are fundamental freedoms, he said, without which there is no democracy. In intimidating and arresting these youth, he said the state wants to snuff out this hope that is emerging.Senegalese and regional civil society groups said the government of the DRC is trying to squash dissent ahead of the 2016 elections.Efforts by the ruling party to amend electoral law in January turned deadly as Congolese took to the streets to protest a provision requiring a new census that would have effectively pushed back the vote by several years and allowed President Joseph Kabila to stay in power. He has been in office for 14 years.Rights groups said at least 40 people were killed during the protests and hundreds detained. The Senate removed the provision.West African rights group Article 19 said the DRC government sought to cut off information, including blocking Internet phone and SMS services like Viber from January 12 to February 19.What they were trying to control, said Khady Diallo of Article 19, were spontaneous demonstrations and calls to action going out on social media.Senegalese and Burkinabe pro-democracy activists were arrested alongside their Congolese counterparts at the workshop in March. They had been invited to participate. They were later released and expelled from the DRC.Among them was Fadel Barro, a leader of Senegalese group Y'En A Marre. Y'En A Marre is known for leading protests against President Abdoulaye Wade’s bid for a third mandate in 2012 that ultimately saw him voted out.Barro said they have no information about their detained Congolese counterparts, “absolutely nothing,” he said, not even how many in all are detained. He said some have been released, while more have been arrested. He said we need to investigate who has disappeared because people are afraid. Some activists are in quasi-hiding, he said, and this is not OK. He said the government cannot stop this movement.Civil society groups said they are launching a series of actions to campaign for the Congolese activists’ release, including filing complaints with international human rights authorities and holding demonstrations outside DRC diplomatic missions around the region at the end of the month.
Waikato Police describe the sentencing of Charlie Lackner in the Hamilton High Court today as an appropriate conclusion to a “tragic saga that claimed a young life”.District Field Crime Manager acting detective inspector Ross Patterson says the 33-year-old forestry worker appeared on a murder charge and was sentenced to a life sentence with a minimum non-parole period of 15 years.“On June 15 last year baby Cassius was found with critical head injuries in the family's York St home,” says Ross. “He died a short time after being rushed to Auckland's Starship Hospital.“The death of a child so young always places emotional strain on the families as well as the police and other specialist agencies involved in the case.“While nothing will ever bring him back we hope today's sentencing will bring the family some closure.”On behalf of police, Ross is thanking the families from both sides, local residents and neighbours who provided assistance to the inquiry team during the course of their investigation.He hopes today's sentencing would highlight the importance of people involved in domestic violence or pressure to seek help before things get too much and a tragedy occurs.“There are a raft of organisations, websites and materials available to assist people, the first key step is asking for help.”
Democratic Republic of Congo government forces, which launched an offensive against FDLR rebels in the east of the country a month ago, has been successful in driving the militants out of parts of North and South Kivu provinces, a military spokesman said.Congolese army spokesman General Leon Richard Kasonga said during the weekend the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) - a Rwandan rebel movement whose presence in Congo dates back nearly 20 years - has been driven out of two dozen localities in North and South Kivu provinces.Kasonga said the Congolese army had captured all its military objectives identified in its initial plan. He said they also "neutralized" 185 FDLR combatants, and other armed groups in the process.DRC Foreign Minister Raymond Tshibanda said last week the army is continuing to pursue the FDLR in the forests of eastern Congo.A health worker at Kibirizi, located on the edge of the vast Virunga forest where many of the FDLR are hiding, told VOA there has been fighting nearby and one place General Kasonga mentioned, Kahumiro, is still off limits to civilians.The health worker said there has been a lot of shooting, and he does not know if the FDLR has been dispersed, but there is still a sense of insecurity in the forest and on certain roads.Jason Ntawiha, a local spokesman for the ethnic Hutu community, said the offensive has had limited impact around Kiwanja, another town inside the zone of operations.Ntawiha said the people expected more of an impact by the military offensive. He said people had hoped the rebels would be completely neutralized. Instead, he said the operation appears to have stalled, rebels are still occupying the positions they held before, and there has been an upsurge in kidnappings and banditry.The FDLR is one of about 30 armed groups active in eastern Congo.Ntawiha is concerned the other armed groups have not been targeted by the offensive.In some areas VOA visited, the FDLR forces are still visibly in control. One such area is near Kanyabayonga, in Lubero territory.The FDLR did not want to give interviews or pose for photos, but they allowed VOA to pass through and talk to area residents.One resident, in speaking with a driver for VOA, said a local FDLR commander was having a drink in a bar just a few yards away.At the village of Birundule, a local official said he had to collaborate with the FDLR, and a local chief said while the rebels were taxing the population, they otherwise were not causing trouble.However, a villager, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told VOA the FDLR is causing trouble elsewhere.The villager confirmed reports that, increasingly, the FDLR’s tactic is not to loot villages where they are living, but to go and loot villages some distance away. The villager said people in Birundule are ready for the Congolese army to recapture the village.Birundule is an example of FDLR "governance." About 50 people from a neighboring village, FDLR-controlled Buleusa, have fled to Kanyabayonga in the past few weeks. They said the FDLR replaced the local chief, and about a dozen young men who opposed the rebels have disappeared.On Wednesday local radio reported FDLR rebels killed five people in the same area, including a chief and two of his sons.The DRC army is pursuing its offensive alone, after the U.N. mission in Congo refused to participate because of alleged human rights violations by two Congolese generals, who are leading the push.Meanwhile, MONUSCO chief Martin Kobler called for collaboration to begin again between the DRC government and the U.N. mission in the anti-FDLR offensive.
THE donation that Prophet Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries leader Walter Magaya gave to the Mighty Warriors on the eve of their All-Africa Game second leg football qualifier against Ghana at Rufaro Stadium on Sunday reportedly caused a major rift in the team, which could be the reason for the team’s defeat against the West African nation.Zimbabwe, needing to overturn a 2-1 deficit from the first round, drew the match 2-2 for a 4-3 aggregate loss to miss out on the ticket to the continental showpiece to be hosted by Congo Brazzaville this September.The home side conceded the goals from two defensive mistakes by goalkeeper Chido Dzingirai and Nobuhle Majika, but a source within the team’s technical bench yesterday said the home side’s problems were deeper than on show.The source said the team went to the match heavily divided over Magaya’s $28 100 cash donation that he had made to the squad during his Friday church service in Harare.The “sponsorship package” was accepted by Zifa chief executive officer Jonathan Mashingaidze who was accompanied to the service by the association’s communications manager Xolisani Gwesela, women football executive members Cecilia Gambe and Elizabeth Langa.The rift, according to the source, saw coach Rosemary Mugadza relinquishing her post in the team on Saturday before she was persuaded back.When asked about the reports, Mugadza could neither confirm nor deny.“There is a lot happening in the team. That’s all I can say,” Mugadza said.When asked if she temporarily resigned hours before the match, Mugadza said: “You can talk to Zifa about that.”The Mighty Warriors players have since received their part of the donation, with each member receiving a total $300 in camping and appearance fees.On the day in question, the source said the Mighty Warriors squad was “coerced” to attend the service soon after their final training session at the match venue.“We were told that we should go to Magaya’s service soon after our final training session on Friday so that he would give us an anointing to win the match,” the source said.“But some were against the idea because of different religious beliefs. We have some from the apostolic denomination and it was not fair to force them to attend. We were then told that everyone should attend the service because we were going to receive sponsorship from the church.“We didn’t have a problem with the sponsorship, but we had suggested that those who were comfortable to attend should do so and represent us all.“An argument on that then ensued just outside Rufaro Stadium and this happened in full view of passers-by. The quarrel was a bit embarrassing, actually,” the source said.“We eventually succumbed to the pressure because we were told Mashingaidze was already there waiting for us. The players went to the service without even freshening up. We were all given ‘anointing water’, which some players threw away soon after leaving the church.“I feel there was no reason for everyone to be forced to attend the service because at the end of the day, it caused friction in the team because others were not happy with what was happening. The team is made up of people with different religious beliefs and they should have respected that.”Gwesela confirmed the team attended the Friday church service, but said no one was forced to do so.“We didn’t force anyone,” said Gwesela. “We would like to reiterate that the association is facing financial challenges and thus we don’t turn away any sponsor who would have come forward.“It is our duty as the association that we find sponsors for the team like we did here even if the sponsor is from the moon. I can confirm that we have already paid the costs of the match using the money we got from PHD.”Gwesela added that Magaya had made a pledge to help Zifa in servicing the $81 000 debt owed to former Warriors coach Valinhos. The debt has seen Zimbabwe suspended from the upcoming World Cup qualifiers by Fifa.
The treatment of children at a Queensland orphanage where hundreds of children were sexually abused, beaten and forced into hard labour was "vicious and sadistic", an inquiry has heard.The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has begun hearings into how the Sisters of Mercy, the Rockhampton diocese and the state government responded to complaints made by former residents of St Joseph's Neerkol Orphanage.The orphanage has already been the subject of several police and government investigations, and a 1999 inquiry led by former Queensland governor Leneen Forde.After the so-called Forde Inquiry, the Queensland government at the time offered ex gratia payments of up to $40,000 to people as long as they dropped other legal action against the state.Over the next two weeks, the royal commission will hear evidence from 18 witnesses, with 13 being former residents of the orphanage who say they were abused by priests, workers, and nuns there from 1940 to 1975.Counsel assisting the royal commission Sophie David SC told the hearing in her opening address that one former resident of the orphanage had described the treatment by the sisters as "vicious and sadistic".She said the children were too scared to tell their stories because they were afraid of harsh punishment.Ms David said the age of children at the orphanage ranged from newborns to 15-year-olds.The number of children resident at Neerkol varied from 150 to 500, depending on the year.The inquiry heard there was serious sexual, physical and emotional abuse of children.In one case, a former resident will give evidence that he was sexually abused by a priest, beaten with instruments and flogged with a whip.Mark Bunting, from support group Lotus Place, said the horrific ordeals of the victims would be painful to recall."For a lot of people, their childhood memories they've tried to forget, it's going to be quite difficult to relive those stories," he said."It wasn't just sexual, there was a lot of physical and emotional abuse, so for a lot of people it'll be very painful."Former Rockhampton bishop Brian Heenan is also expected to appear at the inquiry next week.In 1996, Bishop Heenan outraged the victims of Neerkol by denying their claims about abuse by priests and mistreatment at the orphanage.But in 1997, he was forced to apologise."I regret having expressed my reaction the way I did - I recognise now that they were not accurate," Bishop Heenan said at the time.In a 2003 statement to ABC TVs 7:30 Report, Bishop Heenan said he had "acted at all times with honesty and integrity".In June 2003, a Catholic Church tribunal found the bishop had not seriously violated the church's principles.Central Queensland woman Belinda Brown is petitioning the State Government to reopen the orphanage grounds to the public.She said the site should be used for a public memorial."Unless you [already knew the history], you don't know too much about the place," she said."You have to look into it to find a lot of stuff about it because it's been pushed under the carpet and tried to be kept quiet."A brick wall on the side of the road isn't good enough for the things that happened there - it's not enough recognition for the things that happened."
US researchers have developed a smartphone app that can be used to diagnose cervical cancer and cases of lymphoma.The new app, developed at Harvard Medical School, harnesses several technological advances, including what is essentially a kind of miniature microscope.The head of the cancer program for systems biology at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the lead researches on the project, Cesar Castro, said the process involved introducing samples of blood or saliva into a small cartridge attached to a smart phone."We secured an extra biopsy from women who were undergoing a cervical biopsy to begin with, because they had a suspicious pap smear previously," he said.Dr Castro said the results of the smart phone module showed a link between readouts of the device with the gold standard of screening effectiveness.The application was also able to detect cases of lymphoma and a range of other diseases."We also extended our work to look at DNA from a virus and so the application could be extended into infectious disease," Dr Castro said.A study detailing the development in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) showed the test was fast and inexpensive.It found a cancer screening test using this application would give a result in less than an hour, for less than $US2.Dr Castro said the application was not designed for the average citizen."We would think these would be in community centres, or at least in areas where there will be a seamless kind of integration into the next step with respect to treatment," he said.Dr Castro said the application required further testing."We can certainly move beyond biopsies and use human blood to align with kind of the current push with wearables and other technologies," he said."Information could then be sent to one provider and that could allow certainly to open the channels of communication."Dr Castro said privacy was still a concern as raw data from the application must be processed by a computer and sent back to the smart phone."That's a concern even with our paper records," he said."And so we believe and are optimistic that the security technologies will evolve in parallel."
Lawyers for Eaton Centre killer Christopher Husbands attempted to save the convicted murderer from possible consecutive life sentences Monday by bringing in an expert to talk of Europe’s penal-system philosophies around parole eligibility.“Prisoners need to have something to look forward to ... (and) everyone is entitled to the right to hope,” said Prof. Dirk Smit, of the United Kingdom’s University of Nottingham, who was referring to a case out of European Court of Human Rights.Husbands, 25, was found guilty of second-degree murder in December after shooting two men in the Eaton Centre’s food court in June 2012. It was a crime that also earned him various other criminal convictions for injuring innocent bystanders, including teenager Connor Stevenson, who was shot in the head and left with life-altering injuries.Crown lawyers are seeking a sentence where Husbands would have to serve two consecutive 25-year terms before becoming eligible for parole. Husbands’ lawyers, however, argue this would be cruel and unusual punishment and a constitutional infringement that would give Husbands no chance to rehabilitate or re-enter society.Smit spent the first day of Husbands’ sentencing hearing on Monday answering questions from defence lawyers and prosecutors about case law and policies in various European countries when it comes to long jail terms without parole for serious crimes.He cited a case out of the European Court of Human Rights that Smit said also speaks about “the means to make themselves better” as an emerging prisoners’ right.But Crown attorney John Pearson questioned Smit if he would agree the greatest infringement of human rights is to murder someone.Yes, murder infringes, but “so do (some) forms of punishment,” Smit replied.Outside court, defence lawyer Dirk Derstine said prison sentences beyond 25 years without possibility of parole should be found unconstitutional, and that Smit can provide insight into how “other jurisdictions which are like us” have dealt with it.He maintained that handing Husbands two consecutive terms would be punitive.“As we get further and further away from the ... offence (that was committed), it’s harder to know exactly what the (prisoner) will turn into,” Derstine said, adding it should be Ontario’s parole board deciding when someone is released.
How were Mitch Marner and Max Domi allowed to return to the ice after suffering injuries from head shots in Game 1 last Thursday at Erie Insurance Arena?“If a player comes back out, it’s because he was medically cleared,” the London Knights GM said. “We’re not going to put anyone at risk. We have to do what’s best for the player and their future.”Everyone, including NHL scouts who have to decide each night which games to attend, want to know if Marner will be playing in Game 4 against the Otters Tuesday. He missed the last two games and the Knights figure the decision will wait until a few hours before puck drop.“We can’t go on any outside influences,” McRae said. “The protocol here has always been it starts with the doctor and trainer and player. It’s up to them first. Whether it’s a first liner or fourth, it’s the same thing.“No one oversteps the doctors and training staff. We take our lead from them.”London rookie goalie Tyler Parsons suffered a lower-body injury in Game 2 and sat out Sunday’s loss. He never returned to the bench after his ailment and junior C goalie Paul Town served as backup in Game 3.“It’s day-to-day with Tyler and Mitch,” McRae said. “Each day, they’re improving. The trainers are working with them. You check on them Tuesday and see if they’ve improved and go from there.”
A group of over 50 young people hurled rocks at police and passing motorists and started several small scrub fires during a face-off in Alice Springs.During a troubled night in the town, 42 people were taken into protective custody, 34 young people were escorted home by police and there were eight official reports on property damage made.The rock-throwing incident marks a concerning shift in behaviour, said Superintendent Travis Wurst."This is the first occasion en masse that they have attacked police," he told AAP.A large group of young people "causing a general disturbance" were spotted by police at about 1.30am on Tuesday as they investigated a report of property damage.Members of the group began throwing large rocks at the three officers, who called for back-up.When more officers arrived the group ran off into the river and hills near the botanical gardens, where they started several small scrub fires, which firefighters put out.Rocks were also thrown at passing cars, but there were no reported injuries.It's not known if the group were locals or visitors to Alice Springs."Who knows, we didn't get our hands on them," Superintendent Wurst said.He attributed the increased vandalism to the school holidays, and said families needed to consider whether visiting Alice Springs for an extended period of time was the best thing for them.He also urged parents to monitor their children's whereabouts and ensure they were attending school."It's not acceptable that you just randomly and wantonly damage property that's not yours, endangering other peoples' lives," he said.Police are asking anyone with any information to call 131 444 or Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
South Sydney back-rower Glenn Stewart has admitted he took a dive to deny North Queensland a try in their 30-12 NRL win over the Rabbitohs on Monday night.Stewart hit the ground after colliding with Cowboys forward Ethan Lowe as Michael Morgan scooted over for a try on the stroke of halftime.Referee Adam Devcich referred the decision to the video referees who came back with a no-try verdict.Cowboys captain Johnathan Thurston expressed his extreme frustration towards the referee over the decision.Devcich said to Thurston both he and the the video referees felt Stewart was unfairly obstructed by Lowe.But on Tuesday at a Rabbitohs' recovery session, Stewart admitted to taking a dive to fool the referees.
Brisbane captain Justin Hodges says he is 100 per cent fit and ready to make his NRL return against St George Illawarra on Friday.The 32-year-old has missed the Broncos' past two matches with a hamstring strain but declared himself fit to play after training on Tuesday.Hodges says he has been impressed by the Broncos' climb to the top of the ladder in his absence and he is looking forward to helping the team stretch their winning run to six games against the Dragons.Brisbane is the only team with five wins from the first six rounds, having beaten the Roosters 22-18 in golden point on Friday night.The Dragons sit third as one of four teams with four wins after Sunday's 31-6 victory over Canterbury.But they will likely be without boom back rower Tyson Frizell, who faces a two-week ban for his high shot on Bulldogs prop Tim Browne.

The Provost, Anti-Corruption Academy, a training arm of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other related offences Commission, in Lafia, Nasarawa State, Prof. Sola Akinrinade, speaks on corruption-related issues in this interview with SUNDAY ABORISADEWhat is the mandate of the academy?The Institute is the training arm of the ICPC. Its mandate borders on internal and external trainings. But its primary commission is to train ICPC members of staff and to build their capacity to enable them to deliver on their responsibilities. Every organisation knows what it needs from its workers. If you want to get results from your workers, you need to equip them with appropriate skills and knowledge to enable them to perform such functions effectively.The academy also engages the larger society. First, it engages officials of the ministries, departments and agencies of government. Second, it deals with institutions, organisations that have bearing with the government. In building their capacity, we will be able to tackle corruption in the various agencies. In the last two years, particularly since 2012, the ICPC has carried out a number of studies, trying to understand the corruption-prone activities in various agencies and arms of government. We have been trying to work with the leaders of those agencies in addressing those corruption-prone areas. When we identify the areas, we also work with heads of the agencies to be able to overcome their weakness.We also recommend their personnel for training. For instance, when we noted that procurement issues could be a problem for some agencies, we trained them in tackling corruption in procurement. We work with the agencies in order to identify areas of corruption in their organisations and on how to overcome them.How do you carry out this task?The first thing we do is knowledge production through research. We have a section that deals with knowledge dissemination and we hope to become a centre of excellence in the sub-region in generating knowledge-driven policies for tackling corruption. The other is through the certification programme. We are working with higher institutions to run certificate, diploma and postgraduate programmes, including master’s in anti-corruption studies.How does the institute admit students?Our focus is actually on practitioners, those working in the anti-corruption agencies. Our master’s and diploma programmes are for those already in the system. The aim is to enhance their capacity to deliver and to perform their duties. It is not a generalised master’s programme. It is just to equip those working in the anti-corruption agencies and those in allied areas.We are working with tertiary institutions because we cannot award degrees but we want to work with universities that can award degrees to train these people using their own authorities. We are working with them based on the curriculum we have developed. We are also doing a lot of work with similar organisations in other parts of the world but we want to develop ourselves that is the academy, as a kind of regional centre focusing on training in anti-corruption and knowledge generation.Is the institute making efforts to train workers in private firms?Actually, we are reaching out to the private sector in various ways. There are critical sectors, such as those in the financial sector, in the construction, those in service sector. Again, we are reaching out to those that deal with the government, especially those getting contracts. Sometimes, they are actually the ones corrupting the public sector officials. So we are working with them. We are trying to reach out to these organisations to be able to introduce programmes that would affect them positively.A critical sector that we are hoping to work with is the media. The media is very critical in any issue we are dealing with in terms of reporting and in terms of what it considers important. We will be looking at media and corruption. How the media can assist in tackling corruption. How the media can tackle corruption. It is a big task but if we can construct alliances and build stakeholders in various sectors, it will be a lot easier for us at the end of the day.What is the institute doing to take anti-corruption crusade to the schools and to create the awareness in the minds of the younger ones?I can tell you confidently that we are at the advanced stage of developing our curriculum for anti-corruption studies. The Office of the Special Adviser to the President on Ethics and Values has been working with ICPC over the past few months to develop curriculum for anti-corruption studies and we are trying to reach out to the university system to build in anti – corruption work into its curriculum for general studies.However, I must caution that in building or developing new courses, particularly at the elementary and secondary school levels, we have to be mindful of the amount of the information that we can pump into the young ones. The curriculum that we made use of during our time was not as vast as what they have today in primary and secondary schools. They now have subjects in sexuality, reproductive health, HIV/AIDS, and computer, among others, and all these are expanding the curriculum.We have to be careful about introducing new subjects but we know full that we can achieve the objective by putting in the key elements into the curriculum of the existing subjects. For instance, we can incorporate the elements of anti-corruption into subjects, such as Government and Civic without necessarily developing a completely new programme for them.In the university system, we can build anti-corruption studies into the General Study programme. If we start a new programme, we could build up resistance within the school system. But if we build the content into the various aspects, we would be able to achieve more because the essence is for them to learn to get the issues. It is not so much whether they score an ‘A’ in the subject because scoring an ‘A’ does not mean that you are not going to be corrupt. It only tells you that you know how to bypass the various things. What we are harping on is the attitudinal change among our youths.Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

Chairman of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), Dr. Sam Amadi, has said the agency's decision to initiate and sanction a joint tariff design process by electricity consumers and distribution companies was based on three key reasons.Amadi said  in addition to applying the standard practice of allowing distribution companies come up with data that form its final design and roll out electricity rates to be paid by consumers, it has decided to further deepen the service relationship between electricity consumers and distribution companies by the joint tariff review process. According to the NERC Chairman, the new policy was informed by the need to expand the knowledge of consumers on the operations of the distribution companies to enable them make informed criticism of their actions, get the distribution companies to empathise with consumers in making demands for higher tariffs as well as push the distribution companies to come up with and defend credible data for the tariff review.NERC recently disclosed that it was ceding parts of its regulatory responsibilities of transparently determining an appropriate tariff to be paid by consumers in Nigeria’s electricity industry to both consumers and distribution companies in the sector.It noted that the decision on joint consultation and determination of electricity rates by consumers and distribution companies was based on the need to foster transparency and inclusiveness in the way electricity rates are decided and paid in the sector.Amadi stated that both consumers and distribution companies will now have to sit down together to discuss and determine a mutually acceptable cost reflective tariff to be paid by consumers.He explained that NERC, which will take up an independent umpire role in the process, will also review the propositions and indices presented by the distribution companies during and after the consultation with consumers before signing off the mutually agreed tariff to be used by the distribution companies.He also said that the new process will eliminate extant bickering on any tariff rolled out in the sector, adding that consumers now have the opportunity to critically examine propositions made by distribution companies for tariff review.“Let us understand one thing, the new initiative or approach to tariff design in this sector is not totally new. In most jurisdiction in the world, it is the Discos that prepare their bill and even in the NERC here but then they don’t always do a robust wok on the process but based on that we try to help design a tariff that is fair and affordable to all parties involved.What is happening here is that we are saying to the Discos, take charge of your network, look at your system and then come to us and tell us what they think is the cost at which they need to provide efficient electricity service to their consumers,” Amadi said.He explained further: “We now said that instead of reporting to us, they should first go to the consumers and explain to them about the tariff because when they do their cost profile, they also have to prepare how they will recover it as there are different classes of consumers; they now design their tariff and show us how they will recover according to these classes of the consumers.They now have to consult with the consumers on this but the consultation process is not a consensus process and does not mean that at the end of the day, both parties will agree but it is that it gives the consumers an opportunity to deny, reject or contradict what they are proposing.”On the benefits of the process, Amadi said: “It benefits us because we are pushing the Discos to understand that actually these tariffs that they are designing is not for NERC but consumers who will pay for it and they should be establishing greater relationship with them, they have to show good faith and legitimacy so that consumers will know that they are always there for them.It will also help drive consumer power as I have always emphasised that a comprehensive regulatory framework must have strong consumer power just like in advanced countries where there is always strong consumer advocacy groups which strengthen consumer engagements and advocacy.In today’s economy, market power goes with political power and operators who have access to market power can buy voice because they have access to consultant who can prepare special reports to justify their requests, we also think that consumers should be able to develop that capacity and share information.”
A multinational firm, Sifax Group, has said that corporate social responsibility is at the core of the company’s business philosophy.The group’s Marketing & Corporate Affairs, Mr. Oliver Omajuwa, stated this when the company presented new Toyota Hiace 18-seater bus to the medical students of the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State.He said, “Sifax Group has a philosophy of positively impacting the society. The company is about not only profit making but also contributing its quota to the development of critical areas. One of such key areas for us is education. From primary school to the university level, it has been supporting institutions through various avenues, especially in the provision of infrastructure and equipment.“This gesture is in furtherance of our belief that the private sector has an important role to play in the improvement of the quality of education in the country. We are particularly excited that this bus would of great help to the medical students, in particular and the university as a whole.”The Provost, College of Health Sciences, Prof. Adesegun Fatusi, in his remarks, noted that universities needed to build solid partnerships with various stakeholders in order to fulfil their objectives.According to Fatusi, collaboration with such stakeholders as corporate organisations, alumni, parents, students, and staff is necessary in view of the inadequate allocations the universities receive from the governments.He thanked the company for the gesture, which he described as “historic.”Fatusi added, “This College of Health Sciences is 42 years old and I can confirm to you that this is the first time that a corporate organisation would be donating a bus to us. This donation is a demonstration of a different sense of thinking. We want to express our appreciation to Sifax Group for this benevolence and we believe it is a beginning of a lasting partnership between the university and the company.”He urged other firms to emulate the company by supporting enduring and socially impactful initiatives in education.According to him, education pays the biggest dividends and contributes greatly to the development of society.The Ife University Medical Students Association, President, Dada Ayodele, said the bus would help in fulfilling the association’s objectives, especially in rural medical mission.Copyright PUNCH.

ON a recent visit to Canberra, it was interesting to read in the local newspaper about issues in Canberra’s city centre that were not unlike many of the issues we have been grappling with in relation to central Geelong for some time, such as vacant shops and low numbers of residential inhabitants in the city.As well, issues relating to safety in the Little Malop St mall and surrounds have been brought into sharp focus, with recently reported incidents of unruly and threatening behaviour towards traders.Two very important projects are proactively seeking to address these and other issues and to revitalise Geelong’s city centre into a thriving and appealing hub.The Central Geelong Taskforce, initiated and led by the City of Greater Geelong, has developed the 15-year Central Geelong Action Plan providing a blueprint for revitalisation of central Geelong. The plan is the culmination of many influences, including the Vision2 project spearheaded by visionary thinker and former head of architecture at Deakin University, Professor Hisham Elkadi, along with extensive community consultation and input. It provides a direct and action-orientated approach to resolving issues and making central Geelong an attractive place for people to live, work and play and for investment, business and tourism.It is an ambitious, proactive plan that repositions central Geelong and should address all of the issues that are now deemed to be “problems”.The Geelong Chamber of Commerce has been actively involved in contributing to the plan through an extensive consultation process, with the chamber representing the voice of business on the taskforce.The second key project, focusing on the Little Malop St Mall, is being spearheaded by the G21 Regional Justice Reference Group. A working group, comprising representatives from City of Greater Geelong, Victoria Police, G21 Geelong Region Alliance, youth and government agencies is working with the Minister for Police, Wade Noonan, to develop a long-term strategy to address perceptions of safety in the mall.The chamber has been closely involved in the consultation process and will take a lead role in engaging with traders, starting with two forums to be held next month specifically targeted towards traders, with the objective of addressing safety and perception issues in the mall.The new plan for the mall includes such projects as the #SoYouKnowGeelong campaign, which aims to develop a range of key messages relating to socially acceptable behaviour.The plan to address issues in the mall has adopted a collaborative approach involving local government, business, community, youth agencies, Victoria Police, government agencies and key interest groups, all working together to develop strategies and implement positive change.While some of these changes will take time to implement, it is evident that there is a vast amount of positive energy and goodwill on tap to ensure the success of these two key projects.I look forward to one day in the not too distant future walking down a Moorabool St abuzz with commercial activity and bustling with the vitality of people living and working in Central Geelong, reflecting a cosmopolitan charm and lure that is the essence of Geelong.Bernadette Uzelac is the Geelong Chamber of Commerce chief executive officer.

More than 50 of the girls abducted by militant Islamists in Nigeria last year were seen alive three weeks ago, a woman has told the BBC.She saw the girls in the north-eastern Gwoza town before the Boko Haram militants were driven out of there by regional forces.Boko Haram sparked global outrage when it seized more than 219 girls from Chibok town a year ago.The US, China and other foreign powers promised to help find the girls.However, the girls have never been traced, and little has been heard of them since they were taken from their boarding school.The whereabouts of the remaining girls is not clear.‘Big house’Campaign group Bring Back Our Girls organised a silent march in Nigeria’s capital, Abuja, on Wednesday to raise public awareness about the abductions.In an open letter, Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai called on Nigeria’s authorities and the international community to do more to secure the release of the girls.Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has said the girls have been converted to Islam and married off, fuelling concern that the militants had treated them as war booty and sex-slaves.Mr Shekau has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State (IS), which is also notorious for carrying out abductions in Iraq and Syria.The Nigerian woman, who lived under Boko Haram’s rule in Gwoza, told the BBC she saw the girls in Islamic attire, being escorted by the militants.“They said they were Chibok girls kept in a big house,” said the woman, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals.“We just happened to be on the same road with them,” she added.‘Treated better’Three other women also told the BBC they had seen the girls in Gwoza.Boko Haram was believed to have turned Gwoza into its headquarters after it captured the town in August 2014.Nigeria’s military, backed by troops from neighbouring countries, recaptured the town last month.The militants were suspected to have fled to the nearby Mandara Mountains, near the border with Cameroon.It is unclear whether the girls are with them there.Another woman told the BBC she last saw some of the girls in November at a Boko Haram camp in Bita village, also in the north-east.“About a week after they were brought to the camp, one of us peeked through a window and asked: ‘Are you really the Chibok girls?’ and they said: ‘Yes’. We believed them and didn’t ask them again,” the woman said.“They took Koranic lessons, cleaned their compound, cooked for themselves and they braided each others’ hair. They were treated differently – their food [was] better and water clean. “Nigeria’s outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan has been widely criticised for not enough to end the six-year insurgency in the north-east, and to secure the freedom of the girls.Incoming President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed to “crush” the insurgents.He is due to be inaugurated on 29 May after defeating Mr Jonathan in last month’s presidential elections.Source: BBC
Rights groups on Tuesday welcomed China's release of five feminist activists whose detention for more than a month triggered an international diplomatic outcry, but said concerns remain about their case.The five, all aged 32 or younger, were taken into custody shortly before International Women's Day last month as they were preparing to hand out leaflets about sexual harassment on public transport.The European Union, US Secretary of State John Kerry and his predecessor Hillary Clinton had all issued calls for their freedom, while Beijing said it was an internal issue.All five were released on Monday, which Chinese criminal lawyers said was the deadline for prosecutors to formally charge them.But Liang Xiaojun, one of their attorneys, said: "In the eyes of the police, they are still suspects... they will need to regularly update authorities on their whereabouts."William Nee, China researcher at Amnesty International, said their release was an "encouraging breakthrough", but added: "The authorities must now follow through and drop all charges and restrictions against the women.""Women's rights campaigners should be free to advance human rights without fear of intimidation or the threat of detention," he said. "Yet the reality today is that rights activists are systematically monitored, harassed and suppressed."The five women had been linked to several stunts in different Chinese cities aimed at highlighting issues such as domestic violence and the poor provision of women's toilets.Police originally told lawyers the activists were suspected of "picking quarrels and provoking trouble", a vague charge increasingly used by authorities under President Xi Jinping to detain and jail protesters for holding small-scale demonstrations.They later changed the accusation to "illegal assembly", which carries the same maximum punishment of five years imprisonment.China's ruling Communist Party does not tolerate organised opposition, and often clamps down on small activist groups.But the detentions were seen by rights groups as unusually harsh given the small scale of the women's stunts and the fact that they had been praised in China's state-run media."What they've done has actually furthered legal protection of women's rights and strengthened the rule of law in China," said Lu Jun, of the Chinese campaign group Yirenping, whose office was raided after it backed the five."We feel heartened at the news and impressed by advocacy for their release from inside China and outside China," Lu said, describing their detention as "a glaring injustice".
Election website nominated for Oscars of the InternetOn The Fence – an interactive web tool devised by Massey design students – has been nominated for a Webby Award.The Webbies are the annual awards for excellence on the Internet, with nominees selected by The International Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.On The Fence is the only non-American nomination in the People’s Voice category of ‘political blog/websites’. The web tool started life in 2011 as a student design project to help young undecided and first-time voters to make informed electoral choices and transform disengaged youth into active civic participants. Users indicate how they feel about a selection of issues statements, to find out which political parties most closely reflect their views.In 2014, Massey University’s Design and Democracy Project, part of design studio Open Lab, partnered with Springload, an award-winning New Zealand web company, to redevelop the tool based on user feedback.The other four nominees in the political blog/websites category are Rolling Stone magazine’s online coverage of America’s Gun Violence Epidemic, and US political news/commentary sites factcheck.org, truthdig, and politico. Winners of The Webbies People Voice awards are determined by the number of popular votes nominees receive.Springload chief executive Bron Thomson says the company is delighted at the nomination. “Springload believe the web can make a genuine difference to society and we’ve found awesome, talented and like-minded partners in Massey University. The biggest challenge of this project was creating a great experience on just about any smart device. We’ve built On The Fence to scale – it’s easy to swap out the New Zealand vernacular so that it will work for other democracies.”In the 2014 General Election, On The Fence encouraged 30,000 non-voting 18-34 year olds to vote, representing 7% of the total eligible youth population.Director of the Design and Democracy Project, Karl Kane, says On The Fence helps meet the need for non-partisan information about political options. “Young people are not politically apathetic but they aren’t voting – there’s a difference. Party-political tribalism and spin is a turn-off for them; they want to make values-based choices. That is why On The Fence puts issues first and asks people to think about what they believe.”
On Monday the Ontario premier announced a cap-and-trade "initiative" that’s going to have widespread consequences nationwide.Some gift. Let’s hope she kept the receipt.Wynne claims one of the results will be reduced greenhouse gas emissions. That’s music to the enviro crowd’s ears.But we’re not so sure that outcome is a done deal. This is because of the simple truth that the government can’t - shouldn’t be able to - alter human behaviour with the snap of a finger.What the government can unfortunately do though is bring about social engineering measures that harm the economy.The David Suzuki Foundation sent out a statement celebrating that “Combined with B.C.’s provincial carbon tax and Alberta’s rules for large emitters, [Wynne’s] announcement means that 86% of Canadians and 86% of national GDP could soon be subject to carbon pricing.”There you have it. Straight from the mouths of activists. Almost the whole economy is now going to be hit by a carbon tax.Yet somehow Wynne is able to look at us with a straight face and claim it will “grow our economy,” as she tweeted Monday morning.It’s a funny sales pitch: They call it carbon trading. But it doesn’t matter which parties are trading with each other. What matters is eventually someone has to pay the government for carbon usage. That’s why at its core this is nothing more than a tax.The government also neglected to point out who’s ultimately going to pay for this. Gas will go up by at least a couple cents per litre. Plus we use fossil fuels for virtually every good and service we provide. This is a tax on modern civilization.We’ve learned the hard way that when costs to business go up, the consumer pays in the end.You’ve got to hand it to Wynne. She clearly wants to leave behind a record-setting legacy. For a while there, it was looking as though Dalton McGuinty’s eco-fiascos could not be outdone.Energy costs for businesses were soaring and the regular Joe was getting soaked by rate increases and not-so-smart meters.But Wynne is determined to be the green scheme queen.
THIS REPUBLIC   By Shaka Momodu, Email:  shaka.momodu@thisdaylive.com. SMS only: 0811 266 1654The 2015 elections have come and gone, winners and losers have emerged. Nigeria as widely predicted has not exploded into smithereens. Rather, there is some peace and quiet in the land. Needless to say, Nigeria was on the edge of a precipice and so, we have to be grateful to God that we still have a largely peaceful country. The people have emerged the winners, and in the real sense, there are no losers.The contest was a straight fight between continuity anchored on transformation as represented by the incumbent president, Goodluck Jonathan of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and change anchored on regime change at the centre and possible change of policy direction as represented by his main challenger, Major-General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) of the All Progressives Congress (APC). It is now a fact of our daily lives that one has prevailed over the other - Buhari has emerged as the preferred choice of the people despite my best effort to hold him to account for his past misdeeds. At least, with this historic victory, he has proved Mallam Nasir el-Rufai wrong who once said of him: “Buhari is perpetually unelectable” and has entered the history books as one who never gives up on his dreams - he was fourth time lucky. This will no doubt inspire generations of people never to give up on their dreams. I admire this tenacity, strength of character and congratulate him on his achievements. I wish him well on his mission to fix our country. As God said in the Bible: “Heed the voice of the people...”. The people have spoken, we must all respect their choice.Expectations are quite high and I sense in Buhari’s supporters, that insatiable thirst for the illusion of a perfect man who will make everything perfect - a fanatical expectation borne out of a devotion to make-belief, substitution of historical facts with a warm embrace of fantasies that often isn’t driven by calm reasoning and pragmatism - exactly the type that drove his campaign on social media. It’s a moonshot to think that all of our problems will just go away under Buhari. But more than anyone else, Buhari is to blame for the overblown promises he made and the great expectations the people now have of him. Many, including myself are waiting on him to deliver on those promises - even though I do fervently pray he succeeds because, “this generation of Nigerians, and indeed future generations, have no country other than Nigeria”. And so, we’ll all be affected by his success or failure.  The beauty of democracy is that while the minority must have their say, the majority must have their way. That is what has happened.While I concede to Buhari’s supporters the right to celebrate after a long and bruising battle, however, early signs indicate a sense of gloating - which to me is unhelpful for the country. And I must state here without equivocation that the task of national rebirth is too serious for anyone to gloat in an election where nearly 13 million registered voters voted against him. The circumstances under which Buhari is assuming power are quite dire - and require a deep and sobering reflection on his part. The president-elect needs to contain himself from those baying for blood and vengeance. He should see his mandate as a rare second chance at self-redemption and not persecution of real or perceived enemies. He should rise to the occasion and unite the nation instead of taking any action that will further exacerbate the current divisions and suspicion about his motives. All those who can help, whether in the out-going government or technocrats from the private sector or in diaspora, should be brought on board to add value to the cause of nation-building. As I write, many states have not paid five to six months salaries owing largely to maladministration, mismanagement and dwindling oil revenue. The stark reality of the fierce urgency to build a credible team that will hit the ground running will become clearer when he assumes office on May 29. The fact of the matter right now is that there is no money to meet the high expectations he created with some of the unrealistic promises he made on the campaign stump. So, tackling the myriad of socio-economic problems should be the utmost priority for Buhari. And I dare say the current honeymoon won’t last long before the people start demanding to cash the promissory notes he has given them. Those promissory notes will fall due from May 29 and the people will not accept a default or a returned cheque marked “insufficient funds”.But beyond the victory of Buhari, something momentous and monumental happened - and it has changed Nigeria for good. At exactly 5.15pm on March 31, the unintended real change finally came to Nigeria. An ordinary telephone call from Jonathan to Buhari to concede defeat, burnt-down- the-harry and unleashed extraordinary forces of change on our landscape - finally taking the much needed small step to consolidating Nigeria’s democratic credentials for good. It was unbelievable news to my ears, but then, it was true. The tension-soaked atmosphere immediately cascaded, dramatically replaced with relief, backslapping and joyous celebrations that the doomsday prophets had once again been proved wrong about Nigeria.  I was completely dumbfounded by the gracious humility of the act, and how an otherwise difficult situation can be made to look so simple.That singular act of statesmanship demonstrated by the president, wrote Nigeria straight into the history books and the roll-call of democratic nations. It pulled the country several notches back from the brink of disaster and political instability and effectively set the agenda for national development. Jonathan has brought political stability without which economic progress will not be possible. Indeed, for our tomorrow, Jonathan gave his today. It is an extraordinary  measure of personal sacrifice that has elevated the most vilified president in the country’s history to an instant hero in the hearts and minds of the people. And indeed, his supporters may have some good reason to crow, and we should allow them, if it mitigates the pain of their loss. Instructively, in all Buhari’s three previous failed shot at the presidency, he always refused to concede defeat even when it was obvious he lost.Some have argued that Jonathan didn’t have much of a choice than to accept defeat. Well, true. But my response to that is: we are grateful he didn’t think he had a choice. All he needed for trouble to have started was to disagree with the results - and all hell would have broken loose - as many precious lives would have been lost needlessly and businesses destroyed or disrupted and the much needed foreign investors who held back to await the outcome of the election would have looked elsewhere for their investment. Now, to underscore the seriousness of the situation: just look at the report that 23 people died celebrating Buhari’s victory, then, pause for a moment  and imagine how many people would have died protesting his loss at the polls.And who knows the form the violence would have assumed and how long it would have taken to restore normalcy.  The attendant socio-economic cost to the country can better be imagined.  But living true to his now famous refrain, he proved that his ambition was not worth the blood of any Nigerian. He has put the country first and set a precedent that will be difficult to ignore by anyone. In fact, Jonathan has become the bellwether of our democracy as this event is a turning point in Nigerian history and should this precedent endures, it will change our conduct, attitude to politics and interaction with the system for the better. Consequently, the struggle for power would be less vicious and acrimonious.Another real change that happened in the 2015 elections is that in three federal constituencies of Amuwo-Odofin, Ajeromi-Ifelodun and Oshodi-Isolo in Lagos, non-indigenes were elected by the people to represent them at the Federal House of Representatives to the chagrin of the promoters of change.  By electing Chief Oghene Egoh, Mrs. Rita Orji and Mr. Tony Nwoolu as their representatives to the House of Representatives, the people are sending a loud and clear message to the godfathers that their time is up – and that they need change from the godfathers themselves. I am sure that when they started the campaign for change, they didn’t intend change to mean non-indigenes winning elections in Lagos. But inadvertently, they have unleashed a tidal wave of forces that could change our politics sooner than later.  The president may have been the target of the clamour for change which has now happened. But as in most revolutions, those who start them are more often than not - consumed in the mob hysteria of the moment before sanity prevails. The apostles of change will now have to grapple with a far more deeper and meaningful change than they bargained for.  As the saying goes “events that change the course of history sometimes happen by accident, when they succeed, they have changed the course of history”. We are at that moment in our history now, and I sense that those who promoted change are suddenly worried and fearful of change.Let me leave no one in any doubt here: I am going to hold the president-elect, Buhari and APC to account for every promise they made on the campaign stump. That is the only way to ensure that they do not take Nigerians for granted as we march to a new era, guided by profound uncertainty and extraordinary faith in our nation.Let me remind Nigerians that what Jonathan has done that has earned him many accolades from all over the world was first done albeit on a small scale last year by ex-governor Kayode Fayemi. I was among the many who praised and commended him for his statesmanship and extraordinary courage conceding defeat.  After the results were declared by INEC, he phoned Ayo Fayose - the winner, to congratulate him on his victory. He followed that up with a broadcast to the Ekiti people. Here is an excerpt: “Following the gubernatorial elections held in the Land of Honour, Ekiti State, Nigeria, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has officially returned the candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner of the election.“If indeed, this is the will of the Ekiti people, I stand in deference to your will. If the result of the elections is an expression of the voice of our people, we must all heed your voice.“I have just spoken with my brother, Mr. Peter Ayodele Fayose, congratulating him on his victory. In a few hours from now, I would be meeting the governor-elect to discuss the future of our dear state and how we would work together to institute a smooth transition programme... Despite our diverse party affiliations, and regardless of which way we voted on Saturday, we must remember that we are all sons and daughters of Ekiti State. Ekiti is ours to build together.”When I read that speech, I told myself: “This is it. Finally, we are at the beginning of a new dawn in our politics”.  But no sooner he read his speech he recanted, denying he ever conceded defeat in the first place. Then he went on a fishing expedition for tapes on how the election was rigged. He found one and announced to the world that he was rigged out of office.  I have seen the transcript of the tape. The best I can deduce from it is that there was no level playing field on the day of the election in terms of movement. I didn’t see actual rigging or thumb printing for the winner.  Everything in that tape was largely circumstantial - there was no hard evidence of rigging. I doubt very much if the allegations made much difference to the outcome of the election. Though not a lawyer, I doubt if that tape will withstand thorough cross-examination in a court of law.The doctrine of the soon-to-be ruling party is that elections are only free and fair when it is victorious, otherwise they are rigged. There is no spirit of sportsmanship in its DNA. Fayemi’s recant has denied him a place in that hallowed roll-call of statesmen. He is now just an ordinary politician with eyes always set on the next election.
The federal government has disclosed that there was escalation of avian influenza, commonly referred to as bird-flu (H5N1 virus) in three states of the federation, including Kano, Plateau and Bauchi.The government also stated that it had successfully stabilised the outbreak of the virus in the southern part of the country, noting that the situation was not beyond control.Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD) Architect Sunny Echono gave this hint in Abuja while announcing deployment of equipment’s to118 Agricultural Equipment Hiring Enterprises (AEHE) across the nation.Echono who did not give details of the escalation, promised that government was doing everything to curb further transmission of the virus.“We are on top of the situation, I can confirm to you, indeed, in the south, we have stabilized the situation; there are very few, if any new cases are coming-up. But we are not entirely out of the hook, we have some spite in three states, like Kano in particular, that is the eye of the needle for us, we have an unfortunate situation where we have some degree of escalation, but from our projections, it should have actually dipped or dropped. Then we have also in Plateau and Bauchi,” he said.According to Echono, government had mobilised technical support to the three states where containment and decontamination exercises are currently ongoing. “But we have deployed men and materials and resources to these areas, we have also mobilised support, technical expertise from  our partners and we are on top of the situation in those 3 states. We have teams out there now doing containment, quarantine and decontamination and also dis-infecting premises and they are ensuring that cases of transmission are curbed completely,” he added.THISDAY had gathered in the last few weeks that five additional states of Kaduna, Bauchi, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara states joined the list of affected states, and other state might have been affected without confirmation. It was also gathered that some farmers secretly slaughter their birds for fear that they them test positive to the virus.According to THISDY source, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina had directed that all new discoveries of bird-flu be channeled to a Central Information Unit (CIU) from which only the minister could authorise release of such information.“The minister has directed that information about new discovery and related matters be channeled to a Central Information Unit; nobody except the minister is permitted to speak on the issue. However, I can confirm to you that in the last one week, Kaduna, Bauchi, Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara have been affected.” It is also expected that more states would be affected overtime.“The spread was possible due to movement of people and birds. I can also tell you that some poultry owners secretly slaughter their birds for the fear of been tested of bird-flu, but now that government has made provision to  compensate affected poultry owners, they are now willing to subject their birds to tests, and that is how these news cases were discovered.”Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina had in January announced outbreak of the virus.He disclosed that five states of Ogun, Delta, Rivers, Edo and Plateau states had far recorded cases of bird flu in addition to Kano and Lagos states, where the virus were first reported.
The politicisation of the office of the vice-chancellors is attracting the concern of many stakeholders, CHARLES ABAH writesAs a former Vice Chancellor, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, is not a stranger to the education sector. No wonder, stakeholders listen to him with keen interest whenever he talks about education. So did it happen at a public lecture organised by the Obafemi Awolowo University Muslim Graduates’ Association on Sunday.At the event held at the Lagoon Restaurant, VI, Lagos, Oloyede, a former University of Ilorin VC, dissected the nature of conflicts and multiculturalism in the nation’s university system. Speaking on the theme, ‘The Journey to Excellence: Making Nigeria a Tertiary Education Hub for Africa, he frowned on the localisation of student admission, staff recruitment and, above all, the politicisation of the headship of the universities in Nigeria.The programme attended by dignitaries that included the Chairman, Board of Trustee, Obafemi Awolowo University Muslim Graduates’ Association, Alhaji Rafiu Ebiti; its National President, Prof. Wahab Egbewole and veteran lawyer, Mr. Yusuf Alli (SAN), who was chairman of the occasion, discussed issues of peaceful co-existence on campuses and the nation in general. It was, however, the question of merit in university appointments that bordered Oloyede most. According to him, the era of having VCs outside of their places of origin has given way, with ethnicity and religious fundamentalism playing a critical factor in such appointments.Oloyede said, “Most of the vice-chancellors that were appointed before this period served outside their states of origin and they did well. The list include Prof. Akinkugbe, a Yoruba man, who served as the VC of the Ahmadu Bello University,   a   Hausa-Fulani   enclave;   Prof.   Adamu Baikie, a Hausa-Fulani, who served successfully as the VC of the University of Benin and even got a second term; Prof. J. Ezeilo, an Igbo and Christian, who served as the VC of the Bayero University in Kano, a centre of Islamic civilisation.“Others were Prof. Essien-Udom, an Ibibio, who was at the University of Maiduguri, the Kanuri heartland; Prof. Tekena Tamuno, an Ijaw, who served as the VC of the University of Ibadan; Prof. Onwuemechili, an Igbo, who was at the University of Ife as the VC; and Prof. Ayandele, a Yoruba, who served as the VC of the University of Calabar.”In fact, his observation is not far-fetched. The sector watchers say that of the 79 public universities in the country, the majority of their VCs are from within the locality of the institutions. For instance, apart from the newly established institutions, such as the federal universities at Ndufu-Alike, Otuoke, and Oye-Ekiti, many others have their helmsmen from within the locality of the institutions.The former National Universities Commission Executive Secretary, Prof. Peter Okebukola, agrees with this view. Okebukola, who called it the “the-son-of-the-soil” syndrome, said that it had lately distorted the good governance in the Nigerian university system, just as it had extended to the private universities.He explained, “The phenomenon of “son-of-the-soil” VC is a blight, which is defacing good governance for which the Nigerian university system was noted for between 1948 and the early 1980s. My reading of the aetiology of the malaise is the entrance of state universities into the university education space with state governments insisting that vice-chancellors should be indigenes of the state and other principal officers shared among senatorial districts.“Before the close of the decade, the bug of the son-of-the-soil VC had started to bite the federal university system and today, the sore has festered widely. Only in a handful of the 138 universities that currently make up the Nigerian university system do you find non-indigene vice-chancellors of the geopolitical zone in which the university is located. Even the first-generation universities are not an exemption.”Beyond recognising this anomaly, Oloyede noted that the development had contributed to the conflict in the sector. Nowadays, by his reckoning, the appointment of VC has become very controversial, resulting in ethnic groups coming together to “fight” one another once there is the need for a new VC. Of course, stakeholders at the University of Benin, University of Abuja, among many others, know that the controversies surrounding the appointment of VCs have becoming a recurring decimal.Besides, Oloyede noted that the issue had put VCs under pressure, especially during recruitment of members of staff and admission of students to schools.A retired professor of Political Science, Kayode Soremekun, in an interview with our correspondent, said the development was promoting mediocrity in the system. The former lecturer at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ife, Osun State, described it as the “ghettorisation” of the office of the VCHe added, “It reflects the insularity that is evident in the nation’s politics in which there is the biblical tendency of ‘To your tents O Israel’. What happens in the process is that the mediocre person might end up becoming a VC to which priority is not given to excellence. It is however not a general thing because some VCs can hold their own at the level of competence, merit and intellectual savvy. But when you ensure that the son-of-the-soil gets the job, what it means is that the post will go to the lowest intra-factional consensus. It also lowers the quality of governance and academic delivery in such a university.”However, if the son-of-the-soil is competent to handle the office, is there anything wrong with that? To this, Okebukola argues in the affirmative.He noted, “Ordinarily, there is nothing wrong in having an indigene of the location of the university appointed as vice-chancellor if his/her selection is purely on academic and managerial merit and not because it is now ‘the turn of an indigene’.“Unfortunately, the latter criterion currently holds sway in many of our universities with the local communities, especially the natural rulers pressurising university councils to appoint indigenes or face their wrath. Council buckles under the pressure and appoints the indigene. The indigene vice-chancellor, in turn, shares academic and other appointments among members of staff from local governments in the state and the university is turned into a shamefully parochial institution with merit compromised in governance.“Of course, patronage of the community leaders, who pressed for the appointment, is a necessary payback through dubious contracts and admission of less-qualified candidates from the community. If we are looking for one of the factors negatively affecting good governance in the Nigerian university system and depressing quality of the delivery system, it is this vexed issue of indigene vice-chancellor.”The VC of the Caleb University, Imota, Lagos State, Prof. Ayodeji Olokoju, also admitted that the pattern was inimical to the growth of excellence, which the ivory towers represent. According to him, reducing the loftier academic cum administrative position to ethno-religious and municipal enclaves is akin to sacrificing merit on the altar of mediocrity.He advised, “What is appropriate is for the appointment into the office of the vice-chancellor to be advertised and for anybody coming from anywhere whether in Nigeria or overseas to apply. Again, there is the need for the contestants to have a level playing field. But my worry is that the way the system is structured now, I doubt whether we can achieve this in the actual sense.“For me, a VC must be primarily a man or woman of integrity – intellectual and moral integrity. The person must be of good standing. But a situation where schemers are allowed into the office would not be good for the system. If a mediocre person is there, he will end up reproducing himself and this will affect academic excellence in such a university.”On redressing the phenomenon of “son-of-the-soil” vice-chancellor in the nation’s university system, Okebukola argued, “We can go from the dramatic to the sublime. The dramatic is to insist, through the appropriate regulation, that councils should not appoint indigenes into the post of the vice-chancellor if such a person is outclassed by non-indigenes in the appointment process. The advertisement for such posts should be made in local and international media so that an Ibo scholar from Harvard can apply and be appointed vice-chancellor of the Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and a Hausa professor from MIT can apply and be eligible for appointment as vice-chancellor of the University of Ibadan.“Finding a place for the Association of Vice-Chancellors of Nigerian Universities and the National Universities Commission in the appointment process can serve a moderating and oversight role. Penalty for transgressing the regulation can be as dramatic as relieving the council chairman of his or her job. The sublime approach is to keep a counselling watch through regular governance inspection visits by NUC over “son-of-the-soil” vice-chancellors who have been appointed on merit to ensure that they do not kill the university with the perpetration of the indigeneship syndrome.”Copyright PUNCH.

A Victorian councillor who has shared a string of anti-Islamic posts on social media, including one likening Islam to Nazism, says she will not be removing them despite protests from the community.Over the past month, Latrobe City Councillor Christine Sindt has used her official council profile to distribute posts such as "Islam is not for me" and another calling on Australians to "pick a side".On Easter Sunday, she posted an image of herself at the Reclaim Australia march in Melbourne, holding a poster which says "I love bacon, not paedophilia".In an ABC radio interview last month she said she viewed radical extremists and the broader Islamic community as "pretty much the same".Her views and the series of posts sparked heated debate on her Facebook page as well as in the local Gippsland community.A handful of locals who say the posts are offensive and want them pulled down protested outside Latrobe city council's Morwell offices on Monday, holding signs that said "love not hate".The organiser of the rally, David Hollis, said the protest sent a message to the council that residents were outraged by Cr Sindt's behaviour."[She's] got the legitimacy of authority and it encourages her supporters to target minority groups that really have never been an issue in the Latrobe Valley," he said.Mr Hollis said Muslim people should feel welcome in the Latrobe Valley, not targeted."We're here to show solidarity because we don't agree with what she's saying," he said.The Latrobe City Mayor Dale Hartiman said Cr Sindt had been asked to remove the posts.The mayor raised the issue with the state Local Government Minister, who said it was up to the council to decide if Cr Sindt had breached the code of conduct.Cr Sindt told ABC Gippsland her posts reflect her own personal views and were not targeted at Muslims"There are no anti-Islamist comments on my Facebook page," she said."Any anti-Islamic comments on my Facebook page have been made by different people."In one post, Cr Sindt appeared to suggest the Lindt cafe in Sydney was targeted because it was not Halal certified."Those posts are all factual," she said.Cr Sindt said she was encouraging open debate on her Facebook page and said the posts reflected her concerns about the "potential loss of the Australian way of life".About 30 per cent of the Latrobe City's population was born overseas or had overseas-born parents, according to the local mayor.
Gary Ablett to miss matches as he tries to nurse sore shoulder back to full healthAblett has struggled through the opening two weeks of the season and it has now been decided he risks further damage if he continues to play.It is not known how many weeks he will sit out.Ablett said earlier in the week he was prepared to play through the pain.However pain is not the issue. It is understood an inspection by medical staff had revealed he has suffered a major loss of mobility in the joint over the opening two rounds.The Suns are expected to make an announcement on Ablett’s injury later today.Ablett received extra attention from both Melbourne and St Kilda in the opening weeks and close analysis of game tape reveals he is unable to fend off tacklers, which has always been a key strength of his football.The dual Brownlow medallist underwent a major shoulder reconstruction after the round 16 victory over Collingwood last year.He did not join full-contact training with the rest of his team mates until the week between the end of the NAB Challenge and the start of the premiership season.
The Government has confirmed that Australia will commit a military force to the international Building Partner Capacity (BPC) training mission in Iraq.The force will involve about 300 ADF personnel, drawn largely from the Army’s 7th Brigade, based in Brisbane. They will work as part of a combined Task Group alongside about 100 personnel from the New Zealand Defence Force.The mission of the Australian and New Zealand trainers will be to help the Iraqi Government to prepare sufficient forces to maintain the momentum of the counter-attack against ISIL, or Daesh, and regain control of its territory.On 3 March, the Government announced that it had decided to commence preparations to deploy this force. This followed requests for an Australian contribution from both the Iraqi and US governments.These preparations are now complete and the combined Task Group will deploy to Iraq over the next few weeks.The training mission is expected to be fully operational in May 2015.The combined Task Group will be stationed at the Taji Military Complex north of Baghdad, working to build the capacity of units of the Iraqi army.We will also deploy around 20 personnel to coalition headquarters roles in Iraq.The Air Task Group will continue to support coalition air operations. The Special Operations Task Force involved in the Advise and Assist mission will draw down in the third quarter of 2015.This marks the next phase of Australia’s contribution to the international coalition effort to assist the Iraqi Government to disrupt, degrade and ultimately defeat the Daesh death cult.Iraqi forces, with coalition support, have halted Daesh’s advances and begun to win back ground in recent months. But they require international training support if they are to become self-sustaining in their fight against the Islamist death cult, and ultimately re-establish control over Iraqi territory.Australia joins a number of other international partners already contributing to the BPC mission, including the United States, Spain, Italy, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands.Australia’s BPC commitment is currently planned to run for two years, with progress to be reviewed regularly.The size and nature of Australia’s overall commitment in Iraq will also remain under regular review, taking into account the increasing focus of coalition efforts on building the capacity of Iraq’s security forces.The decision to commit ADF personnel to this important mission is not one that has been taken lightly. But it is firmly in Australia’s national interest.The Daesh death cult is reaching out to Australians, as the terrorist incidents here late last year demonstrated.This commitment reflects the Government’s steadfast commitment to keeping Australians safe from terrorism and preventing the spread of violent extremism to our shores.
Calling for new American leadership that is not "stuck in the 20th century," Republican Senator Marco Rubio officially launched his presidential bid Monday, a day after top Democrat Hillary Clinton announced her campaign.Rubio, a 43-year-old Florida lawmaker and son of immigrants from Cuba who often casts his personal arc as the embodiment of the American Dream, presented the 2016 presidential election as "a generational choice about what kind of country we will be."The remark, in a hometown speech at Miami's Freedom Tower that once processed Cuban immigrants into the United States, was a clear jab at his older rivals, notably Clinton, 67, and his fellow Republican and former mentor Jeb Bush, 62."While our people and economy are pushing the boundaries of the 21st century, too many of our leaders and their ideas are stuck in the 20th century," Rubio said to loud cheers."Now, the time has come for our generation to lead the way forward toward a new American century."Rubio has enjoyed a remarkable political rise since running for Senate as an underdog in 2010, when he was swept into Congress on a conservative Tea Party wave.Should he win in 2016 he would make history as the nation's first Hispanic commander-in-chief.Equally at ease discussing foreign policy, deficit reduction, his family's compelling narrative or hip-hop music, Rubio took a direct swipe at Clinton."Just yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday," he said as supporters booed at the mention of Clinton."But yesterday is over, and we are never going back."Rubio joins two other Republican first-term senators who are already running: Ted Cruz of Texas, who is also Cuban-American, and Libertarian-leaning Rand Paul from Kentucky.Cruz in a statement welcomed his friend to the presidential rodeo, saying Rubio will help "elevate the debate for all of us."While Clinton has few serious Democratic challengers -- Vice President Joe Biden and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley have expressed interest but little else -- several more Republicans may jump into the fray, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry.Should Bush, a former governor and the son and brother of two presidents, enter the race as expected, his duel against fellow Floridian Rubio could be a compelling narrative of the Republican primary.Rubio wants to take voters beyond the dynastic Bush-Clinton dynamic that has ruled national politics for much of the last three decades.Youthful, charismatic and articulate on several issues, Rubio hopes to transcend the Republican Party's reputation for difficulty in connecting with young, Hispanic or African-American voters.Rubio, a fierce critic of President Barack Obama's gentler approach on global issues, is hawkish on foreign policy, a Tea Party favorite with potential to draw conservative votes.But he angered core conservatives two years ago when he helped craft a bipartisan immigration bill that would have provided pathways to citizenship for millions of undocumented workers, a plan he backed away from after it died in the House of Representatives.Rubio's kickoff notably came just days after Obama shook hands with Cuban strongman Raul Castro at a regional summit, the visual symbol of a detente to which Rubio is fiercely opposed.Former secretary of state Clinton finally announced Sunday what everyone already knew: her intention to join the race to succeed Obama and give Democrats a third-straight presidential term for the first time in more than half a century.Clinton immediately hit the campaign trail, striking a note of humility with her pledge to champion "everyday Americans" -- a departure from her hard-as-nails approach in 2008, when she lost her party's nomination to Obama.Crowding into a van, she drove from New York toward the key Midwestern state of Iowa, where she will hold small roundtables with middle-class voters beginning Tuesday.In her first fundraising email as a candidate, Clinton told supporters Monday she would "work my heart out" to earn votes."I've spent my entire life standing up for women, children, families, and anyone who needed a little help along the way," she wrote."That's what this campaign will be about, and that's what I'll do every single day as your president."Clinton's first major rally and the speech that kicks off her campaign is not expected until May.While Clinton aims to break the "glass ceiling" and become the nation's first female commander-in-chief, her Republican rivals want to reverse course from what will be eight years of Obama policies they say have made America weaker and economically stagnant.

Beth Stelling promises a night that will appeal to devotees of theatresports, storytelling and mordant observational comedy.
As for the possibility of the sport returning to Montreal at some point in the future, several hurdles remain.“I do think it’s important for Montreal to have a firm plan as to how they would get to a major-league facility, a site, a financing plan and the like in place,” Manfred said Monday. “In terms of a timeline for an actual franchise, it’s just impossible to tell.“I mean obviously there are two ways you can get there. Expansion — which I see as a back-burner issue for baseball right now — and relocation. That obviously depends on developments in other markets.”Earlier this month, over 46,000 fans attended a pre-season game between the Toronto Blue Jays against the Cincinnati Reds. More than 50,000 fans showed up to watch the teams play again the next day.The city has been without a franchise since the Montreal Expos last played in 2004. The Blue Jays also played a two-game series in Montreal before the 2014 regular season.Montreal Mayor Denis Coderre is one of many baseball fans in the city hoping to see the sport return on a full-time basis.“We do not have a meeting set but I would be very happy to meet with the mayor of Montreal,” said Manfred, who took over as MLB commissioner in January when Bud Selig retired.The commissioner discussed the Montreal subject during a media availability before the Blue Jays’ home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays on Monday night at Rogers Centre.
Former Hamilton West MP and city councillor passes awayFormer Hamilton city councillor and Labour MP for Hamilton West, Dorothy Jelicich, has died, aged 87.Mrs Jelicich served as a Labour MP for Hamilton West from 1972 to 1975 and had a brief spell on Hamilton City Council after winning a bi-election in 1979. She then went on to become a long-serving member of the Manukau City Council, serving the community as a councillor from 1980 to 1995.Former Hamilton West MP and current Hamilton City councillor Martin Gallagher says Mrs Jelicich was admired for her energy and commitment to Hamilton. He says her contribution to local government and to the Kirk/Rowling Labour government was "very significant.""Mrs Jelicich was a strong and passionate advocate for women's rights and had a strong interest in youth and encouraging young people to serve their community," Cr Gallagher says. "She was a significant mentor in my life, teaching the values of social justice, and always leading by example. Our thoughts are with Dorothy’s family, who were always strongly supportive of her respective roles as MP and city councillor."Mrs Jelicich was one of only four female MPs in the House in the third Labour Government.During her time as Hamilton West MP she led the all-women New Zealand delegation to the United Nations population conference in Bucharest in 1974, becoming the first woman from New Zealand to be a UN delegate. Mrs Jelicich was made a Companion of the Queen’s Service Order for public services in the 1986 New Year Honours List.A service celebrating her life will be held at 11am on Saturday at the Manukau Memorial Gardens Chapel in Puhinui Rd, Papatoetoe.
There are a lot of problems with a Hillary Clinton candidacy.The “manifest destiny” sense of entitlement to become president that she’s carried with her since at least her 2000 campaign to be New York senator grates on the nerves of many observers, Democrats as well as Republicans.A lot of people are also bothered by the dynasty-meets-monarchy element of an endless line of Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton rulers. America is supposed to be the land of opportunity. Not a place run by a few savvy and ambitious families.The gender issue is incredibly annoying. The West should be over this by now. Americans already voted for – or in some cases against – a president because of the colour of his skin. Now we have to do it because of gender? No more affirmative action leaders, please. Judge her based on her merits and faults.Then there’s her record as secretary of state. The Benghazi incident was inept management. It was an example of following, not leading.Despite wanting to harness new media in her current campaign, the recent e-mail records scandal proves she abuses technology to her advantage.Instead of defending the First Amendment rights of the amateur American filmmaker behind the harmless Innocence of Muslims project, she called it “disgusting and reprehensible” as others around the world were responding to it… in an actually disgusting and reprehensible fashion.In other words, her international leadership chops are questionable at best.But as serious as these are, they’re all secondary issues. At least compared to the one that has the power to further downgrade America's standing in the world. The biggest problem with a Clinton candidacy is: How much further can the progressive agenda go?The driving impetus behind the Democratic tradition is that there is more to be done. More laws. More programs. More institutions.Clinton – to her credit – is not on the left of her party, like Elizabeth Warren. The Clintons are pragmatists before they’re moralists or idealists.The challenge though is that any Democratic pragmatist will know that the party and the electorate, coaxed further leftward by the government’s constant insistence that it must be the central clearinghouse for all aspects of your life, must be promised “more” by the politicians. Even if Clinton and her strategists believe that there isn’t much “more” to be done. Which there isn’t.Two big recent events in American politics are illustrative of this.The first is Obamacare. Nowadays, the conversation around the president’s signature program should have little to do with whether average Americans deserve some form of government health care. It should be about, as so many progressive edicts are these days, the obsession with control. The health care reform program locked in the government’s control of a sixth of the economy.Reflect on that for a bit. In one fell swoop, the government got its claws into a full sixth of the economy. They took a significant percentage of human interaction that was more or less private sector and made it their own. That’s madness… well only if you define socialism as madness, I suppose.The other is the government shutdown in October, 2013. Remember that? Legislation couldn’t get passed to fund government operations so non-essential services stopped.The White House crunched the impact at a $10 billion loss to the economy for each week of shutdown. That’s clearly a bad thing. But few people asked the right question out of this: Why is the government so big and involved in our lives to begin with that contracting it for a couple of weeks can cause this much damage to the economy?But this of course wasn’t the lesson the Democrats learned. So the fiscal can was kicked down the road once again.The U.S. government’s control of the economy has grown as has its fiscal liabilities. The balance sheet isn’t looking good.If Hillary Clinton became president following a Republican administration, she could coast into office claiming to fix whatever perceived Republican missteps the public was braying against. It’s one of the reasons Obama’s campaign and honeymoon period were such a cakewalk.But instead Clinton has to inherit the legacy of Barack Obama and somehow claim that even what he did wasn't enough. That the mighty ship of state must snowball on. She’ll need to do this because it’s the only way moderate Democrats can differentiate themselves from average Republicans.So she’ll argue that “more” must done. And that’s a problem. So here's what Americans need to be on the lookout for: What more? How much more? Who will it control or restrict this time? And at what cost?

Ann Bryden told the Geelong Advertiser yesterdayshe was struggling with the news that charges had been laid against Robert Penny for the murder of her sister — Mr Penny’s wife, Margaret Penny, in a hair salon in 1991.He appeared in Melbourne Magistrates’ Court yesterday after being charged with the killing of Mrs Penny and her hairdresser, Claire Acocks.“I’ve only heard myself when the media rang this morning,” Mrs Bryden said, as she nursed a photo of her elder sister who she described as a “good and gracious lady”.“This has to go through all the due processes and I can’t comment until then.’’Her family — two daughters and a son-in-law — were at her side yesterday in her home as she wrestled with the sudden news.Mrs Bryden said she had always looked up to and admired her beloved sister, who she had missed dearly since her shocking death.Both Mrs Penny and Mrs Acock were held captive, terrorised, bound to chairs with electrical cord and stabbed to death in a wild frenzy, a crime that remained unsolved through the decades.Mrs Penny, 58, was keeping her regular Friday hair appointment with Mrs Acocks, 49, when they were killed.Yesterday, sitting quietly in her Geelong West flat surrounded by her family, Mrs Bryden remembered her glamorous older sister.“There was a seven year age gap between us,” she said. “By the time I was at school she was working. But she had so many beautiful things I used to go in her room and look at her clothes and all her jewellery.’’Mrs Bryden reflected on the trips she would make to visit her sister.“I’d ride my bike all the way out to her farm to see her, it was a good half-an-hour ride,” she said.The mystery of her sister’s death has plagued Mrs Bryden throughout the years.Mrs Penny’s son Tony yesterday thanked the Victoria Police for their ongoing commitment to solving the crime. In a written response, he said his ‘heartfelt thoughts’ were with the Acocks family.“I will continue to assist Victoria Police in any way possible, in the hope that the perpetrator or perpetrators will be brought to justice,’’ he said.
Surf Life Saving NSW have issued a dangerous surf warning for the state’s entire coastline.PICTURES: SEE INSIDE BILLIONAIRE’S PRIVATE JETILUKA SITE TO REACH FOR THE SKY HIGHER THAN Q1NSW Life Saving manager Andy Kent said the swell was expected to peak between 2m and 4m later today and urged swimmers, surfers and boaties to check the latest forecasts before hitting the water.He said extra care needed to be taken by boat skippers crossing coastal bars, in particular.Mr Young said the swell would miss the Gold Coast because of the shape of the coastline.“The Gold Coast is naturally protected from south swells, so I’m hopeful we won’t see too much of an impact,” he said.Weatherzone meteorologist Ben McBurney said the big swell would be met with mostly fine weather that would warm as the week continued.“It looks like there will be a few showers around (today) but I think they will remain pretty light with less than 1mm predicted and a top of 26C,” he said.A light shower is also expected tomorrow, with a top of 27C.
A man in his 70s has been attacked by a crocodile on a Port Douglas golf course.The man was taken to the Mossman District Hospital in a stable condition after being bitten on the leg just after 4pm, a Queensland Ambulance spokeswoman said.Paramedic Zak Pitra said the bite caused a deep cut to the man's shin and a puncture wound to his calf.The attack occurred at the Palmer Sea Reef course on Old Port Road.The golf club has been contacted for comment.Politician and mining tycoon Clive Palmer purchased the course in 2012, and tweeted his well wishes to the injured man."I would like to wish the well-known local man who was attacked by a crocodile in Port Douglas this afternoon a speedy recovery," Mr Palmer said.In January, a pesky crocodile held up play at the course when it camped itself between the path of the 11th and 12th holes.The club put up a photo of the reptile on Facebook."After a lot of encouragement he finally decided to move just enough for the golfers to pass," they wrote.
The businessman who headed up the Abbott government's commission of audit believes voters haven't been convinced about unsustainable spending in areas such as welfare, aged care, education and health.The government needed to "go back to the idea of saying we do have an expenditure problem," Tony Shepherd told The Australian Financial Review on Tuesday."The myth it's a revenue problem has to finally be nailed. The revenue problem will never fix the expenditure size of the problem."Small Business Minister Bruce Billson defended the government's performance, saying it had been arguing the case for prudent spending."But we've got to do both," he told Sky News about the need to address revenue and expenditure.
On 14 April 2014, 279 schoolgirls were kidnapped by the Islamist militant group Boko Haram in Chibok, northern Nigeria.The government's slow response in finding the missing girls caused a global uproar. Many protests took place and an online campaign went viral.But a year later 219 girls are still missing.BBC News looks back at the past 12 months.
Marco Rubio officially entered the race for the White House on Monday, declaring that “yesterday is over” and that the 2016 US presidential campaign would pose “a generational choice” – ostensibly toward what the Florida senator called “a new American future” but also between himself, Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush.One day after Clinton cast a looming shadow over the entire election, Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrant parents, announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination at Miami’s Freedom Tower – the “Ellis Island of the south” where thousands of families fleeing Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution were processed.“Yesterday, a leader from yesterday began a campaign for president by promising to take us back to yesterday,” he said. “But yesterday is over, and we are never going back.”Attacking the policies of Barack Obama’s administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, Rubio said the time had come to look ahead with the same determination once shown by the waves of Cuban immigrants trying to build a new life in an unfamiliar country. Those exiles, he said, were a part of “the larger story of the American miracle”.Before an appreciative audience of more than a thousand supporters, campaign workers and media inside the tower, plus thousands more watching on a giant screen outside and a largely approving political class beyond that, Rubio declared that the United States was still the same land of opportunity the migrants had discovered it to be.“United by a common faith in their God-given right to go as far as their talent and work would take them, a collection of immigrants and exiles, former slaves and refugees, became one people, and together built the freest and most prosperous nation ever,” he said.“My parents achieved what came to be known as the American dream. But now, too many Americans are starting to doubt whether achieving that dream is still possible. The time has come for our generation to lead the way towards a new American century.”Rubio, the third Republican in the 2016 race following the earlier declarations of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, and the fourth overall following Democratic frontrunner Clinton’s Sunday announcement, touched on a need to replace Obama’s signature healthcare law, what he deemed outdated immigration laws, the need for tax reforms and tighter controls on federal spending.He also accused the Obama administration of “dangerous concessions” to Iran and hostility toward Israel.But some of the loudest cheers came when Rubio returned to the theme of Cuba and the struggles of his father, a bar tender, and his mother, a retail worker, in the early years after their arrival in Miami from Cuba in the 1950s.“I regret my father did not live to see this day. He used to tell me all the time: ‘En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos’ – in this country, you will achieve all the things we never could,” Rubio said.“That journey, from behind that bar to behind this podium, is the essence of the American dream. Whether or not we remain a special country will depend on whether that journey is still possible for those trying to make it now.”Rubio, 43, born in Miami and the father of four young children, said he would be campaigning for America’s working classes, “the workers in our hotel kitchens, the landscaping crews in our neighborhoods, the late-night janitorial staff that clean our offices and the bartenders who tonight are standing in the back of a room somewhere.”“If their American dreams become impossible, we will have become just another country,” he said. “But if they succeed, the 21st century will be another American century. This will be the message of my campaign and the purpose of my presidency.”Since his election as a young city commissioner in the small south Florida city of West Miami in 1998, Rubio’s rise through the Republican ranks has been remarkable. He was on the job for just a year before his first run at state office, winning a seat in the Florida House and becoming its majority leader four years later.In 2006, he became House speaker, a role in which he attracted the attention of senior national Republicans. Rubio had his own sights set on higher office by the time his spell in Tallahassee came to an end in 2009. Given little chance against the former Florida governor Charlie Crist in the 2010 race for the retiring Mel Martinez’s US Senate seat, he rode the Tea Party’s wave of national popularity to a huge upset.A skyrocketing star in Washington, Rubio served has served on the commerce, science and transportation and foreign relations committees, and was shortlisted, but ultimately passed over for another Republican starlet, Paul Ryan, to be Mitt Romney’s running mate in his ill-fated 2012 presidential campaign.It has not, however, been all smooth sailing for Rubio, who was forced to concede that his parents were not forced out of Cuba during Fidel Castro’s 1959 revolution, but instead came to the United States several years before as de facto economic refugees.Rubio also suffered a Republican backlash for his role as one of the so-called Gang of Eight bipartisan Washington politicians who crafted immigration reform legislation that would have opened a path to citizenship for the estimated 11m undocumented immigrants living in the US illegally.Once a staunch advocate of such a policy, he was forced to backtrack in the face of strong opposition from Republican hardliners. His revised stance is that American borders must be secured before any further discussion on the issue can take place, a position derided by many immigrant advocacy groups who had hopes that Rubio might be the politician to carry through Obama’s vision on meaningful immigration reform. Dozens of activists rallied outside the Freedom Tower on Monday to protest against his views.Rubio, however, is seen by many as one of the nation’s most gifted political orators, with an ability to convey his opinions with confidence and authority. Even when he was widely derided for an uncomfortable moment in his televised response to Obama’s 2013 state of the union speech, when he broke off to make an awkward lunge for a water bottle, he was able to laugh off the incident and turn what could have been a public relations disaster into his advantage.Perhaps the biggest problem facing Rubio in the 2016 campaign is the likely presence of his friend and political mentor Jeb Bush, Florida’s former governor and brother to the last Republican president George W Bush, as a rival for his party’s nomination.Bush has yet to formally declare, but reports say he already has a war chest approaching $100m. Rubio, his aides concede, cannot hope to match Bush’s financial clout, but he is not concerned.“Other candidates will have more money and bigger operations than Marco Rubio will, but he’s going to have the best message in the race,” Rubio press spokesman Alex Conant said ahead of Monday’s announcement.Rubio will need to quickly catch up to the poll ratings of his closest rivals if he is to take a deep run at the Republican nomination. A Quinnipiac University poll this month showed Rubio trailing behind Bush and Wisconsin governor Scott Walker , both yet to announce their intentions, in his home state.“I’ve heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn,” Rubio said in his speech on Monday, “but I cannot.”Many of the supporters at Rubio’s Freedom Tower event, too, were unfazed by his apparent lack of support from within Florida.“Rubio is about making America respected again throughout the world, building a strong military,” said John Nelson, chairman of the Highlands County Tea Party Republicans, who led a delegation of five group members at the rally.“He has strong American values, more than any other candidate. I’m not here for myself, I’m here for my granddaughter. It’s not about me and now, it’s about my granddaughter and her future. It’s about building a strong future for America. I believe only Marco Rubio can do that, not Jeb Bush or any of the others.”Gina Sosa, treasurer of the Log Cabin Republicans of Miami, which describes itself as an all-inclusive advocacy group with many LBGT members, wanted to hear Rubio preach a message of equality. She said she was not worried by Rubio’s one-time position on his immigration bill, later retracted, that he could not support reform if it included citizenship for gay couples.“He has accomplished a lot as a young man and he brings experience to the campaign. I’m excited and proud to support him. Our job is to fight discrimination and support inclusion and I believe that’s what Marco Rubio brings to the table,” she said.For Shane Pagano, of Log Cabin’s Orlando chapter, the choice for the nomination is simple: “I believe Marco Rubio is the JFK of his generation, a once in a generation politician,” he said.
Ten wildlife and conservation organisations are calling for a three-year ban on the culling of mountain hares on Scotland's grouse moors.The moors provide an ideal habitat for mountain hares.But gamekeepers may cull the animals in an effort to protect red grouse from the tick-borne louping ill virus.Wildlife groups say there is a lack of scientific evidence to support the claim that culling hares protects grouse.Simon Jones of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, one of the groups campaigning for a moratorium, said: "We, along with the other organisations, are calling for a three year ban, to allow time for all those involved to take stock of the longer term impacts of large scale culling."Once the results of the study have been published we will then be able to identify the best ways to monitor mountain hare populations and measure the impact that management is having on their conservation status."The unregulated and seemingly unsustainable culling that is endemic on many grouse moors is a threat to these important populations."Duncan Orr-Ewing of RSPB Scotland said: "Very little is known about their current numbers of mountain hares and population trends."We also don't know what impact these large scale culls are having on mountain hares' wider conservation status, which could mean the Scottish Government may be in breach of its legally binding international EU obligations to this species."The calls for a ban have drawn an angry response from gamekeepers' leaders.A spokesman for the Scottish Gamekeepers Association said: "For groups with environmental credentials to call for such an environmentally irresponsible measure beggars belief."The numbers of tick, already a growing problem in the countryside, will escalate, endangering any bird that nests on the ground, not to mention the potential repercussions for human health."It will be bad for birds and bad for biodiversity."The ten organisations calling for the three year ban are:Meanwhile, landowners have said such a move would be "ill informed" and "heavy handed".Tim Baynes of the Scottish Moorland Group told BBC Scotland: "We firmly believe the management of the hare population as it is at present is sustainable."This does mean some culling for sound habitat conservation reasons, but not to the extent where it threatens a population."We know in broad terms the numbers of hares and it is a population that is thriving."Scottish Natural Heritage has pledged to work with "all interested parties" to make sure that management practices are not damaging the species' long-term prospects.Responding to the call for a moratorium, a spokeswoman said: "Mountain hare populations can fluctuate widely and are influenced by a range of factors - the cyclical nature of the species, habitat fragmentation, changes in land use and over-culling"We have already asked estates for restraint on large-scale culls of mountain hares which could jeopardise their conservation status."We continue to gather evidence on numbers, status and changes and for this reason have commissioned further research by Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust and the James Hutton Institute to inform local and national management."

Actress Melanie Hill has admitted she will never fill Hayley’s shoes as she arrives on Coronation Street as a new love interest for Roy Cropper.The former Bread and Waterloo Road star admits that she has a tough act to follow playing Roy's new companion Cathy Matthews following the death of his beloved wife.Accrington-born actress Julie Hesmondhalgh won a host of awards for her harrowing portrayal of cancer battler Hayley, who drank a lethal cocktail to take her own life.Now Cathy has been tasked with helping Roy, played by David Neilson, to get over Hayley's death as a new permanent character.And Melanie knows winning over Corrie fans will be tough. She said: “I could never fill Hayley Cropper’s shoes - I’ll just wear different shoes.“She was so well loved and the public went through that. It was a bereavement and the fans felt it so much that I am aware of that.“I am prepared for comparisons, so I might have a bottle of wine before I go on Twitter.READ MORE: Things in Coronation Street that don't make sense“I think that is why I am gradually being introduced as a friend. I would never attempt to fill her big shoes. I am just happy to come in in my own right as a friend of him.”Melanie's character meets Roy when they start working on adjacent allotment plots. They confide in each other after Cathy reveals she is getting over the death of her husband.She said: “She’s lost her husband so they are lost souls.“Her husband happens to have the allotment next to Roy’s, so she goes and hangs out there and that’s when she bumps into Roy and they strike up this odd friendship.”The Sunderland born actress, who played Aveline in the 1980s sitcom Bread and Maggie Budgen in Waterloo Road, says her audition for Coronation Street was the most nervous she has ever been.Melanie, who will appear as Cathy from next Monday, says it was the character Roy that sold the role of Cathy to her.She admits she was daunted about meeting Corrie legends such as Barbara Knox but she has been taken under the wing of her fellow castmates including David and Les Dennis who plays Michael Rodwell.She said: “I got a call from my agent asking if I would like to be interviewed for Coronation Street.“I’ve never been as happy in my life because it’s been a life-long ambition to do Coronation Street.“I’ve grown up with it and I’ve got to a point in my life where I am happy to go into a long-running drama. Staying for a long time would be ideal for me.”
When Iraqi Prime Minister Haider Abadi sits down in the Oval Office on Tuesday, he is expected to ask President Obama to boost U.S. military assistance to help his beleaguered government push Islamic State militants out of Iraq.But Obama will be seeking assurances that Abadi will rein in the Shiite Muslim militias that helped Iraqi forces drive militants out of Tikrit and other towns in recent weeks, but then carried out reprisals against some Sunni Muslim residents, according to an administration official briefed on the visit.Abadi is making his first visit to Washington since Obama sent U.S. troops and aircraft back to Iraq in August to help degrade and defeat the Islamic State. The two leaders met in September at the United Nations in New York.U.S. support for Abadi's government has grown steadily since then and is likely to increase as the war against Islamic State intensifies.U.S. Special Forces soldiers helped identify Iraqi military units that could be retrained and rearmed after tens of thousands of troops abandoned their posts and fled during Islamic State's blitz into western and northern Iraq last year.U.S.-Iraqi military operations centers were set up in Baghdad and Irbil, capital of the Kurdish region of Iraq. American soldiers are training Iraqi forces at four bases in the country, including at Al Asad air base in Anbar province.The U.S. also has provided Iraq with 100 million rounds of ammunition, 62,000 small weapons, 1,700 Hellfire air-to-ground missiles, and 300 mine-resistant armored personnel carriers. Iraqi pilots are training on F-16 fighter jets at a U.S. Air National Guard airfield near Tucson.The closer military and political relationship with Washington marks a sea change from the tenure of Abadi’s predecessor, Nouri Maliki, who kept the Obama administration at arm’s length.After he took office in September, Abadi came under pressure from U.S. diplomats to fire military officers who the U.S. said were incompetent or openly corrupt. In November, Abadi replaced 36 Iraqi commanders.Last month, when Iranian-backed militias had stalled in their assault to retake Tikrit, Abadi telephoned Vice President Joe Biden.“When I spoke with him,” Biden recalled in a speech at National Defense University last week, “he made it clear that he wanted the United States and the coalition engaged ‘all over Iraq,’ was his phrase.”U.S. warplanes, which had not played a role in the Tikrit assault, soon began pounding Islamic State positions around the city. The militants' defenses collapsed within days and Iraqi forces retook the city.Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Monday that he's not aware of specific requests that Abadi is bringing. But he added, "If there are specific ideas that Prime Minister Abadi has for stepped-up assistance, then we'll obviously consider them seriously."The administration has "obviously been very supportive of his efforts, both diplomatically, but also in terms of providing support and assistance to Iraqi security forces," Earnest said. "And we anticipate that that partnership and that support will continue.”
These days, many doctors are wont to deliver women through caesarean section (CS). But the World Health Organisation (WHO) is urging doctors not to breach ethics in the use of CS, writes OYEYEMI GBENGA-MUSTAPHA.Some women give birth with ease; some do not. To help such women out, doctors ask then to go for Caesarean Section (CS). So, when is cs necessary? It is when there is a medical reason for it, says the World Health Organisation (WHO) where normal delivery is possible, doctors should shun cs, WHO adds, noting that many go for CS without any medical  reason, thereby putting mothers and their babies at risk.According to WHO, CS is a common surgery whose rate is on the rise, particularly in high and middle-income countries.CS becomes necessary when vaginal delivery poses a risk to the mother or baby – for example due to prolonged labour, foetal distress – or because the baby is presenting in an abnormal position.“However, caesarean sections can cause significant complications, disability or death, particularly in settings that lack the facilities to conduct safe surgeries or treat potential complications,” it stated.The WHO Statement on Caesarean Section Rates is based on two studies carried out by the UNDP/UNFPA/UNICEF/WHO/World Bank Special Programme for Research, Development and Research Training in Human Reproduction. This programme is the main instrument within the United Nations system for research in human reproduction, working within the Department of Reproductive Health and Research of the World Health Organisation.The global health watch dog said since 1985, the international healthcare community has considered the “ideal rate” for caesarean sections to be between 10 percent and 15 percent. New studies reveal that when caesarean section rates rise towards 10 percent across a population, the number of maternal and newborn deaths decreases. But when the rate goes above 10 percent, there is no evidence that mortality rates improve.“These conclusions highlight the value of caesarean section in saving the lives of mothers and newborns,” said Director of WHO’s Department of Reproductive Health and Research, Dr Marleen Temmerman. “They also illustrate how important it is to ensure a caesarean section is provided to the women in need – and to not just focus on achieving any specific rate,” she said.She added: “Across a population, the effects of caesarean section rates on maternal and newborn outcomes, such as stillbirths or morbidities – birth asphyxia – are still unknown. More research on the impact of caesarean section on women’s psychological and social well-being are still needed. Due to their increased costs, high rates of unnecessary caesarean sections can pull resources away from other services in overloaded and weak health systems.”The organisation said the lack of a standardised internationally-accepted classification system to monitor and compare caesarean section rates in a consistent and action-oriented manner is one of the factors that have hindered a better understanding of this trend, hence WHO is proposing the adoption of the Robson classification as an internationally applicable caesarean section classification system.The Robson system classifies all women admitted for delivery into one of 10 groups based on characteristics that are easily identifiable, such as number of previous pregnancies, whether the baby comes head first, gestational age, previous uterine scars, number of babies and how labour started. Using this system would facilitate comparison and analysis of caesarean rates within and between different facilities and across countries and regions.“Information gathered in a standardised, uniform and reproducible way is critical for health care facilities as they seek to optimise the use of caesarean section and assess and improve the quality of care,” explained Temmerman. “We urge the healthcare community and decision-makers to reflect on these conclusions and put them into practice at the earliest opportunity,” she added.A member of Society of Gynaecology and Obstetrics of Nigeria (SOGON), Dr Adebayo Bamisebi, explained why more women are undergoing CS. He said: “There is a better understanding of the relevance of CS to safe delivery nowadays. Before now there is a morbid fear on what CS entails and does not. But with better enlightenment, more professionalism and equipment to work with, professionals launch into CS to save mother and child. The fear is based on the notion that anything that pertains to operation in this part of the world is fearful because we don’t trust our medical experts, with a mindset that anything can happen.”Bamisebi continued: “There are many reasons a health care provider may feel that an expectant woman will need to have a CS delivery. Some caesareans occur in critical situations, some are used to prevent critical situations and some are elective.“Some reasons for the increased use of caesarean childbirth include the use of heart rate monitors to evaluate the fetal heart rate pattern; baby positioned in a manner other than head first; woman’s preference for repeat caesarean sections; labour does not progress to delivery; mother has an active genital herpes infection (the baby needs to avoid potential exposure through the birth canal); mother has HIV infection; presence of obstructions such as benign or malignant tumors in the lower reproductive tract or pelvic anatomical abnormalities; malpractice concerns, i.e, birth in a private, for-profit hospital; woman’s higher level of education and social status and increased maternal age, as more women are having babies later in life.”He said: “Also, the most frequent reasons for performing a caesarean delivery are repeat cesarean delivery: There are two types of uterine incisions – a low transverse incision and a vertical uterine incision. The direction of the incision on the skin (up and down or side to side) does not necessarily match the direction of the incision made in the uterus.”He said the medical reasons for CS are: “Previous cesarean deliveries as women with a prior history of more than one low transverse cesarean section are at slightly increased risk for uterine rupture. This risk increases significantly when the woman has had three caesarean deliveries. If an abdominal delivery is planned and a trial of labor is not an option, the best time for delivery is determined when the lungs of the fetus are mature.“Lack of labour progression: If the woman is having adequate contractions but no change in the cervix (opening to the uterus) beyond three centimeters dilation or the woman is unable to deliver the fetus despite complete dilation of the cervix and “adequate” pushing for (generally for two to three hours or more), cesarean delivery may be performed.“Abnormal position of the foetus: In a normal delivery, the baby presents head first. This is the way it happens in most births. The smallest diameter of the human skull is presented to the pelvis in the most advantageous way. This increases the success of a vaginal delivery. There are various other presentations of the fetus, which make vaginal delivery difficult, including the commonly known breech position (when the baby’s buttocks are in the lower portion of the uterus). Certain forms of breech delivery have a very low increased risk to the fetus. Breech deliveries may cause more complications, including death and neurologic disability. Careful counseling, analysis of the exact type of breech position, an estimate of the baby’s weight, and other information are required before making any decision about an attempted vaginal delivery or delivery by cesarean section.”Bamisebi added: “The fetal status, although an attractive and much-used tool, the fetal heart rate monitor has not improved birth outcomes as once expected. Some believe the lack of improved outcomes is because many current practicing doctors are poorly trained in interpreting the subtleties of fetal heart rate patterns. Since the use of continuous fetal heart rate monitoring in labour was begun, however, birth experts say death of a fetus during labour is much rarer than in the past.“Emergency situations: If the woman is severely ill or has a life-threatening injury or illness with interruption of the normal heart or lung function, she may be a candidate for an emergency caesarean section. When performed within 10 minutes of the onset of cardiac arrest, the procedure may save the newborn and improve the resuscitation rate for the mother. This procedure is performed only in the direst of circumstances. Likewise, elective sterilisation, but desire for elective sterilisation is not an indication for caesarean delivery. Sterilisation after a vaginal delivery can be performed via a tiny three-cm incision along the lower edge of the umbilicus or as a delayed procedure six weeks after delivery with laparoscopic surgery or vaginal surgery.”
Far from confirming the claim of the incurably deluded spokesperson for Goodluck Jonathan’s doomed re-election campaign that his principal had conceded defeat out of patriotism rather than because he lost irredeemably, last weekend’s gubernatorial and state assembly elections show dramatically just how diminished, how washed-up the “biggest political party in Africa” has become.One of its chieftains, who would later stand trial for criminal embezzlement (he was cleared by the courts) had declared that the PDP would rule Nigeria for 60 years “in the first instance.”More recently, as she barged from one campaign stop to another, hurling coarse abuse at her husband’s opponents and inciting rented crowds to stone anyone demanding a change from   the status quo, Dr Jonathan’s wife had stamped her ample personal authority on continuity:  60  years of PDP power, nothing less.In the event, the PDP’s reign, which has drawn far more tears than cheers, is mercifully set to expire after just 16 years.An obituary notice to that effect, a spoof on the standard Nigerian fare, has been doing the rounds. With due acknowledgement to its anonymous author and high praise for his or her creativity, I quote the epitaph in part:“With gratitude to God and total submission to the will of the Nigerian Electorate,  we announce the death of our party, grand party and great-grand party, PDP, on March 30, 2015, after a prolonged illness from corruption, impunity, arrogance, bomb blasts, etc.“Funeral services will be held on May 29, 2015, at Eagle Square, Abuja, at 10 a.m”To be sure, the reports of the PDP’s death are somewhat exaggerated.   However, persuaded that it has served its time and now faces a bleak future, many of its hardiest denizens are bailing out as if it were a ship on which an outbreak of Ebola fever has just been confirmed.  The PDP, they have now realised, with their own Iyiola Omisore, is nothing without the Presidency.As things stand now, the APC has, in addition to winning the Presidency, racked up comfortable majorities in both houses of the National Assembly, and all the principal officers of that body will come from its ranks.  It also has some 20 gubernatorial chairs and the same number of state assemblies under its control.Not bad for an opposition party that Dr Jonathan’s wife derided endlessly as an “expired drug”’ that has undergone so many name-changes that it might yet call itself “Ebola” — a party against which her husband who was only last week being hailed as a statesman for merely doing the decent thing, re-launched a vile, divisive, money-drenched campaign in a desperate but ultimately futile bid to supplant in Lagos, its stronghold.Oba Rilwan Akiolu’s bellicose warning to the Igbo to vote for the APC gubernatorial candidate Akinwunmi Ambode or face the consequences may well have been his answer to Dr Jonathan’s dishonourable campaign. But that is no justification. Whatever happened to noblesse oblige?Fears that Nigeria may become a one-party state, what with the rate at which members of the PDP are abandoning ship for the victorious APC bring to memory the aftermath of the 1983 general elections during which the NPN, inebriated with its stolen victories across Nigeria, declared that all other political parties had become “irrelevant.”   Three months later, it was swept into oblivion by the military.The APC must not for a moment indulge in such hubris.  Nothing stops the PDP from re-building itself into a strong and credible opposition party the way a decimated Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) under the dynamic and committed leadership of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu had done before the merger that produced the APCFor one thing, even in those geopolitical zones where it is weakest, the PDP still has some diehard supporters, witness its entrenchment in the South East and South South where the plucky Rochas Okorocha and the much-persecuted but resolute Chibuike Amaechi are the last men standing, its tenacious grip in Ondo, its close run in Lagos, and its comprehensive sweep in all the elections held in Ekiti in the past two weeks.At his inauguration last July, Ekiti Governor Ayodele Fayose had in a speech that sounded as if it was an entry in the diary of a mad man, had vowed to drive the ACN not just out of Ekiti but out of Yoruba land and Nigeria.A delusion, to be sure; but he seems to have succeeded in driving it out of Ekiti.In the June 2014 election that returned Fayose to power after a previous outing remembered mainly for high scandal, arbitrariness, brazen corruption and sophomoric stunts, he won a majority in every local government to defeat the incumbent, Dr Kayode Fayemi.We now know, through damning documentary evidence produced by a competent witness, that the victory was procured, not by the so-called stomach infrastructure strategy, but by good old-fashioned skullduggery.But the formula Fayose employed to deliver Ekiti to Jonathan in the presidential race, secure the election of three senators, six members of the House of Representatives and 26 members of  the state assembly, all of whom he had personally handpicked, without challenge  – how Fayose constituted Ekiti into a one-party state remains one the best-kept secrets of Nigerian politics.Household per household, Ekiti is reputed to have the largest number of holders of advanced degrees not just in Nigeria but in all of Africa, and surely ranks high in the world league for that distinction, if it does not sit at the very top.That a delinquent who parades his mother’s infirmity of the most intimate kind in the market square to score a cheap political point can hold them in thrall, pervert all they hold dear and block every recourse to justice and redress, is an affront and a standing rebuke to the learned and highly accomplished people of Ekiti, and the elders who won’t call him to order.History will show that Fayose could not have done it without Dr Jonathan’s close collaboration or active connivance.  But how will the Ekiti people explain this tragic turn in their history to their progeny?To return to what lies ahead, at this defining moment:  The task before the APC now is to transform a loose coalition into a focused governing party and translate slogan into actuality.  It must deliver change – change that Nigerians can feel and see in their living conditions and in the lives of their children.Not change that will occur in a nebulous future, like regular power supply, but change with an immediate impact.It cannot be business as usual.  Governance cannot be a jobs-for-the boys scheme.  In this data-driven age, it cannot be an encounter of the unprepared with the unforeseen.Public expectations are high.  There is so much do, so much to fix.During World War II, one American military unit had this as its motto:  “The difficult task we do right away; the impossible takes a little longer.”That is the spirit that should animate the APC as it prepares to take power and guide it throughout its rule.This must not be another false dawn.
Anxiety has gripped the people of Ado- Ekiti, as the state awaits the Supreme Court’s verdict today on the June 21 governorship election won by Governor Ayodele Fayose.The All Progressives Congress, APC, in the state, having lost the bid to have the Election Petition Tribunal and the Appeal Court upturn the victory of Fayose of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, had approached the Supreme Court to seek redress.While Fayose in a statewide broadcast yesterday asked residents to keep the peace and go about their lawful duties, the APC raised an alarm over alleged plan by PDP to attack its members and supporters if the judgment threatened Fayose’s position.Publicity Secretary, Taiwo Olatunbosun, said in a statement that the party had uncovered plans to burn houses of APC leaders and cause bodily harm to its members and supporters if the judgment is not favourable to the governor.However, factional Speaker of the House of Assembly, Dele Olugbemi, alleged plan by some individuals to plunge the state into chaos.Olugbemi said yesterday that he was under pressure from some unnamed forces in Lagos and Osun states to withdraw his support for Governor Fayose “with a view to succeed in the illegal bid of the APC lawmakers in the state Assembly to impeach the governor.”The PDP speaker, who said the decision of the APC lawmakers to discontinue suit No FHC/L/CS/1823/2014 filed by the embattled Speaker, Dr Adewale Omirin, challenging his November 20, 2014, impeachment was among steps being taken to lure him into their camp.Olugbemi, who said his belief in the cause of Ekiti development could not be sacrificed on the altar of any form of inducement from sponsors of the APC lawmakers, said Ekiti would not be allowed to become a theatre of war again.The lawmaker told a press conference in Ado- Ekiti yesterday that the plan of APC lawmakers “is to cause another state of emergency in the state. That is why they are coming up with all these.“We have had enough political instability in Ekiti State and this time around, those who caused the 2006 imbroglio will not be allowed to destabilise the state just because their party has been voted out of power in the state.“Governor Fayose was elected to govern Ekiti for four years and those throwing stones from Lagos and Osun states are warned to desist lest they incur the wrath of Ekiti people,” Olugbemi said.Last Thursday, the Omirin- led APC lawmakers had said they had written the state Chief Judge, Ayodeji Daramola, to set up a sevenman committee to investigate Fayose over the impeachment allegation they leveled against him.But Olugbemi, in a swift reaction on Friday, urged the Chief Judge to ignore any letter purportedly written by the APC lawmakers, describing Omirin as an impostor having been impeached and challenging his impeachment as Speaker in court.
The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has asked a Lagos High Court sitting in Ikeja to adjourn sine die (indefinitely) its ruling on an application filed by a former Managing Director of Bank PHB, Mr. Francis Atuche.                             Atuche is seeking to quash the  N25.7 billion theft charge preferred against him alongside his wife, Elizabeth and a former Chief Financial Officer of the bank, Ugo Anyanwu.At the resumed sitting of the court yesterday, counsel to the EFCC, Mr Dele Adesina (SAN) in an application,  urged  Justice Lateef-Lawal Akapo of Lagos High Court, Ikeja to adjourn the ruling indefinitely.Adesina said the application  was pending the outcome of the appeal filed against the Court of Appeal judgment of November 21,2013  by the EFCC which struck out the theft charges preferred against a former Managing Director of Finbank Plc, Mr. Okey Nwosu and others for lack of jurisdiction.Adesina told the court that the EFCC had filed an appeal against the judgment at the Supreme Court, adding that the matter has being granted expeditious hearing due to its importance.In his response,  Atuche’s counsel, Mr Tayo Oyetibo (SAN) asked the court to reject the application. Oyetibo told the court that the application was intended at truncating the ruling which was listed as the business of the day.Atuche had approached the court for the quashing of the charge, arguing that like Nwosu’s case, the state high court had no jurisdiction to entertain the matter.Oyetibo had maintained that the cases were similar in nature because they emanated from capital market transactions.“The appellate court had held that such capital market-based matter was an exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal High Court,” he said.To buttress his submission, he referred the court to the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Lagos, delivered December 31 last year in the case of Dr. Erastus Akingbola against the Federal Republic of Nigeria.According to him, the appellate court struck out the case against the former Managing Director of the defunct Intercontinental Bank Plc, on  similar grounds.                                                                                            However, after taking the submissions of both parties,  Justice Lawal-Akapo said nobody could predict the time the Supreme Court would arrive at its verdict in the said appeal.He said judges at the lower court had waited for over a year for the apex court to clarify the ruling given by the Court of Appeal on the Okey Nwosu’s case.He adjourned the matter till April 22 this year for arguments on the application.

About 20 people gathered last night outside Latrobe City Council's Morwell offices, in south-east Victoria, to protest against the anti-Islamic social media activity of a councillor.The protesters are demanding that council discipline Cr Christine Sindt for posts on her council-linked Facebook page which link Islam to terrorism, hate and paedophilia.Protesters held signs which said 'love not hate'.The council has pledged to bring in a mediator to speak to Cr Sindt, after she refused to remove the posts.The organiser of last night's protest, David Hollis, said Muslim people should feel welcome in the Latrobe Valley, not targeted."We're here because Cr Christine Sindt has been saying some things about members of the community and they're feeling targeted, they're feeling a bit scared," he said."We're here to show solidarity because we don't agree with what she's saying."Mr Hollis said the protest showed council that residents were outraged by Cr Sindt's behaviour."It's [Cr Sindt's Facebook page] got the legitimacy of authority and it encourages her supporters to target minority groups that really have never been an issue in the Latrobe Valley," he said.Cr Sindt said she did not have time to comment before last night's council meeting.She has previously said her Facebook posts reflect her own personal views.
Two men are facing charges after homes and vehicles in three northeast communities were riddled with bullet holes Sunday morning from an overnight shooting.Police were called at about 11:45 p.m. Saturday after a dark-coloured truck was spotted in Temple, Monterey and Abbeydale with occupants “randomly” shooting at cars and homes.At least three vehicles and two homes were damaged during the shooting spree, costing an estimated $10,000 in damages. No one was injured, but three people reported they had been threatened by the men.Police arrested two suspects and seized a rifle at about 12:30 a.m. Sunday.Sabri Ahmed Sabrie, 21, and Wasiullah Aminzada, 22, both of Calgary, are facing several charges, including five counts of mischief causing danger to life, possession of a weapon for a dangerous purpose, unauthorized possession of a firearm and uttering threats.Police believe the gunfire was random and that no particular property or resident was targeted.

Environmentalists and the Greens are calling on the NSW government to ban coal seam gas mining following a report showing gas shortages in the state are unlikely.Revising earlier forecasts, the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) on Monday said it did not expect gas shortages in NSW in the short, medium or long term.In the report, the AEMO, which manages the national electricity market, attributed the revision largely to a "17 per cent decline in the 2019 forecast for industrial, residential and commercial gas consumption"."The only forecast medium and long-term supply gaps are in Queensland," AEMO added.The government has previously pointed to supply shortages as a reason to pursue gas projects in order to keep energy prices down.Greens NSW mining spokesman Jeremy Buckingham said coal seam gas mining should be banned across the state following the AEMO report."The Baird government should revise its NSW Gas Plan to exclude coal seam gas, given it is unnecessary, has been comprehensively rejected by voters and is not worth the risk to land and water," Mr Buckingham said in a statement.Community lobby Lock The Gate urged "a complete redrafting of New South Wales onshore gas policy"."The basis for the government's support for developing unsafe unconventional gas mining in rural areas was the expectation of a supply gap that we now know is not going to occur," co-ordinator Georgina Woods said in a statement.She said without increasing gas demand, there was no need for the government's Gas Plan "and no justification for industrialising New South Wales farmland".However, Cheryl Cartwright, from the Australian Pipelines and Gas Association, cautioned against limiting gas supply in the state."In order to halt or slow the demise of the nation's manufacturing sector, long-term gas supplies must be brought to the domestic market," she said."We need government policies that encourage this supply."CSG was a key issue in the recent state election, and a driver for big swings against the coalition in some regional seats, including Ballina and Lismore.He said rising gas prices were hurting industry, leading to a drop in demand."This is a clear signal that manufacturers and other businesses are suffering, as are those employed by them," he told AAP in a statement."Supply constraints are causing rising prices which has led demand to fall. There may still be potential for gas shortfall, however AEMO is now saying this is much less likely due to industrial wind-down."To put downward pressure on energy prices we need the growth of viable gas projects - it's that simple."
MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin on Monday opened the way for Russia's delivery of a sophisticated air defence missile system to Iran, a move that would significantly bolster the Islamic republic's military capability.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry objected to Moscow's decision in a phone call to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and the White House indicated the move could endanger plans to ultimately lift sanctions on Iran as part of a final nuclear deal.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said unity and co-ordination with nations like Russia is critical to the success of the negotiations.Putin's move was quickly welcomed by Tehran, while it worried Israel, which saw it as a sign that Iran already had begun to cash in on the nuclear deal with world powers that is expected to be finalized by the end of June.Russia signed the $800 million contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but suspended their delivery three years later because of strong objections from the United States and Israel. Putin on Monday lifted that ban.The preliminary agreement on settling the Iranian nuclear standoff reached earlier this month made the 2010 Russian ban unnecessary, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a televised statement.The deal reached by Iran and six world powers is intended to significantly restrict its ability to produce nuclear weapons while giving it relief from international sanctions. The agreement is supposed to be finalized by June 30, and there is no firm agreement yet on how or when to lift the international sanctions on Iran.The S-300 missile system, which has a range of up to 200 kilometres (125 miles) and the capability to track down and strike multiple targets simultaneously, is one of the most potent air defence weapons in the world."The S-300 is exclusively a defensive weapon, which can't serve offensive purposes and will not jeopardize the security of any country, including, of course, Israel," Lavrov said.Deployed in big numbers, the system could provide a strong deterrent against any air attack. If Israel decides to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, the S-300s would further complicate the already daunting task.Israeli Cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz said the framework nuclear agreement helped legitimize Iran and cleared the way for Monday's announcement by Russia.Israel has harshly criticized the U.S.-led nuclear deal, saying it would give Iran relief from sanctions while leaving its nuclear program largely intact. Israel believes Iran still intends to develop a nuclear weapon."This is a direct result of the legitimacy that Iran obtained from the emerging nuclear deal," Steinitz said. He added that the arms deal shows that Iran plans to use the relief from economic sanctions to buy arms, not improve the living conditions of its people."Instead of demanding Iran stop its terror activities that it spreads in the Middle East and the entire world, it is being allowed to arm itself with advanced weapons that will only increase its aggression," Steinitz said.Lavrov didn't say when Moscow could deliver the missiles. Russian officials previously said that the specific model of the S-300 that Russia was to deliver under the 2007 contract is no longer produced, and offered Iran a modified version of it called S-300VM, or Antey-2500.In Tehran, Gen. Reza Talaeinik said the decision by Russia on delivery of the air defence system will help improve ties between Tehran and Moscow, the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is close to Iran's military, reported.Back in 2010, Russia linked its decision to freeze the missiles' delivery to the sanctions the United Nations Security Council imposed on Iran over its nuclear program, but Lavrov argued Monday that the Russian move was voluntary and not directly required by the U.N. resolutions."It was done in the spirit of good will in order to encourage progress in talks," Lavrov said. "We are convinced that at this stage there is no longer need for such an embargo, specifically for a separate, voluntary Russian embargo."Iran responded to the Russian ban by filing a lawsuit with a court in Geneva seeking $4 billion in damages for breach of contract, but the court has not issued a ruling.
OTTAWA — Mike Duffy apparently billed the taxpayer to print and mount photos of his family, Barbara Bush and Bill Clinton as part of a contracting agreement he set up outside the scrutiny of Senate officials, court heard Monday.Crown prosecutors began the second week of the Duffy trial laying out their case on a particular set of charges against the suspended senator involving contracts awarded to his friend Gerald Donohue for research and consulting work.Duffy faces 31 charges in total, of fraud, bribery and breach of trust. Donohue allegedly received $65,000 in contracts, with some of that money in turn filtering out to other service providers.The photographs are a case in point.Documents filed in court show that Donohue's two companies, Maple Ridge Media and ICF Ottawa, sent $1,578 to a photo developing company for work Duffy appeared to request."5 x 7 enlargement — (Miranda/Colin) (3 in original order + 5.25, 4 more 5 x 7 ordered Jun 13/11 by phone," reads one line item. Miranda is Duffy's daughter, and Colin is his grandson."8 x 10 Medite Mounted — Barbara Bush + 1 11 x 14 Medite Mount — same," reads another item, a reference to the wife of former U.S. president George Bush.Duffy's daily diaries, filed in court last week, also include a reference to sending photos to Barbara Bush.Several newspaper articles were also mounted. In a few instances, there appeared to be items that were specifically ordered for Duffy's wife Heather.Crown prosecutor Jason Neubauer took Senate human resource officer Sonia Makhlouf through some of the procedures she would have gone through as she evaluated contracts submitted by senators.He asked her whether she would have approved of a request for a "photographic services" contract."I will not proceed with it and probably I will bring it to a higher level," Makhlouf said.It is not clear what Duffy was doing with the photographs. Senators and MPs often decorate their offices with photographs of themselves and other politicians, as well as favourable newspaper articles.The Crown also suggested Duffy carefully juggled and squeezed his upper chamber office budget in order to pay the maximum amount possible to a friend doing contract work.In 2009-2010, Duffy repeatedly adjusted the amount that he would pay to Donohue for "consulting and editorial services" after hearing how much was left in the budget. Ultimately, Donohue was paid an extra $14,000 at the very end of the fiscal year."I have been waiting for them to assist me with a project on the aging Canadian population, but had held off giving them the assignment because under the impression that I was out of funds for the fiscal year," Duffy wrote to the Senate human resources department."As it turns out, we have a small surplus that can be used."The same thing happened the following year, in 2010-11. Duffy at first asked for Donohue to be back-paid for work dating back to the beginning of the fiscal year, but then settled for paying Donohue $13,560 at the end of 2010 after getting an accounting of what was left in his office budget.Makhlouf also testified that while she reviewed the amount of contracts and their timing, she did not investigate a contractor's qualifications or check if the work had been completed."I don't validate this information," she said. "It's at the discretion of the senator."That matches testimony given last week by former Senate law clerk Mark Audcent, who bolstered the defence case that the Senate's rules on everything from residency to what constitutes official business are vague."In layman's terms, you hire who you want to do the work you want done," defence lawyer Donald Bayne asked him Friday. "Yes," Audcent replied.Bayne said during his opening statement last week that if the senator is guilty of anything, it is administrative errors, and not criminal behaviour.
Supermarkets are mounting a "slow but steady fightback" as new industry figures showed a big jump in retail sales last month.Retail like-for-like sales rose by 3.2% year-on-year, according to the British Retail Consortium (BRC) and KPMG, in the strongest growth since January last year. The period covers the five weeks to April 4 and was flattered by pre-Easter trading.The gain is the third month in a row of retail sales improvement since a fall in December. Like-for-like sales lifted by 0.2% in February and January.Food sales were the strongest contributor to growth last month, experiencing their strongest trading since July 2013, as shoppers stocked up ahead of the holiday period.This was a ray of light for grocers amid the prevailing gloom of falling prices at supermarkets due to intense competition from discounters.David McCorquodale, KPMG's head of retail, said there were signs of recovery in the grocery sector amid a slow but steady fightback.However, he added: "Price deflation continues to dog the sector, and while supermarkets may be selling more, they are pedalling hard to stand still."Today's figures also showed that stores contributed more to growth on a three-month weighted average than online sales for the first time since August.Furniture and household appliances provided the second biggest contribution to the industry's growth, helped by the recovery in the housing market.But clothing sales were subdued last month, particularly womenswear, as colder weather than a year ago made current spring and summer ranges less appealing.BRC director general Helen Dickinson said: "All-in-all, retailers can also be satisfied with the consumer response to their Mother's Day and Easter offerings, but it is important to note that April figures will be impacted by the absence of Easter this year."IHS Global Insight UK chief economist Howard Archer said: "Given the importance of consumer spending to the economy, a solid BRC survey for March following on from the very healthy retail sales in February would be reassuring for hopes that gross domestic product growth held up reasonably well in the first quarter."Tesco has made gains under a turnaround led by new chief executive Dave Lewis, with till roll figures from Kantar Worldpanel showing sales grew 0.3% in the most recent 12-week period.Sainsbury's also lifted sales by 0.2% to a 16.4% market share during the 12 weeks to March 29.The closely watched Kantar survey said competition in the industry remains intense with pressure from discounters causing prices to fall across the industry for 19 months in a row as a result of higher levels of promotions and deflation in major categories such as vegetables, milk, eggs and bread.
TV star Christopher Eccleston has warned that working-class actors are finding it tougher than ever to make it.The former Doctor Who and Our Friends In The North actor, 51, was brought up in Salford by working-class parents.He warned that British culture had become bland because of the dominance of actors from privileged backgrounds in the industry."I still feel insecure, like a lot of my working-class contemporaries. I had a sense acting wasn't for me because I'm not educated," he told Radio Times magazine.Eccleston, who left Doctor Who after one series as the Time Lord in 2005, said: "I was a skinny, awkward-looking bugger with an accent, as I still am."British society has always been based on inequality, particularly culturally. I've lived with it, but it's much more pronounced now, and it would be difficult for someone like me to come through."He added: "You can't blame Eddie Redmayne, Benedict Cumberbatch and others taking their opportunities but it will lead to a milky, anodyne culture. To an extent that's already happened."Eccleston, who now stars in new ITV thriller Safe House, said: "I confess I don't watch much film or television drama but I'm aware of the predominance of white, male roles."It's not just about the working class. There's not enough writing for women or people of colour."It frustrates me when they insist on doing all-male Shakespearean productions - a wonderful intellectual exercise, maybe, but it's outrageous because it's putting a lot of women out of work."The star, whose parents supported his ambition to become an actor, said that the "Billy Elliot cliche (a northern coal miner's son whose family discourage him from becoming a ballet dancer) is very offensive".Earlier this year, TV dramatist Jimmy McGovern revealed that he was struggling to fill working class roles because of a dearth of actors from poorer backgrounds.Veteran actress Julie Walters, The Walking Dead star David Morrissey and Call The Midwife star Stephen McGann have complained about a shortage of young actors emerging from poorer backgrounds.Eccleston previously said that he left Doctor Who after one series following its comeback in 2005 because "I didn't agree with the way things were being run, or like the culture that grew up around the series".Now he has told the magazine that he does not watch the sci-fi show - currently starring Peter Capaldi.He said of the way he played the Time Lord: "I wanted to move him away from RP (received pronunciation) for the first time because we shouldn't make a correlation between intellect and accent, although that still needs addressing."I hope I'll be remembered as one of the Doctors. I have no ill feeling towards the character or the series. I don't watch it and am not keen to discuss it because I want this to be about Safe House. That's my mortgage."For more stories like this, visit our entertainment, lifestyle and events website nativemonster.com
The amount of money spent on research into dementia and stroke in the UK is still far too low, health experts have said.Analysis of funding for research into the four main causes of death and disability in the UK - cancer, heart disease, dementia and stroke - found just 10% was allocated to dementia and 7% to stroke research.The study, led by the University of Oxford, said this was despite these conditions having huge economic and personal impact , with the social care costs of dementia outweighing that of the other three conditions combined.The combined amount of research funding allocated by the Government and charities to all four conditions came to £855 million in 2012, almost two-thirds of which (64% or £546 million) was spent on cancer.Around one fifth (19% or £165 million) was devoted to heart disease, with £85 million on dementia and £58 million on stroke research.That same year, there were around 2.3 million cases of cancer, the same number of coronary heart disease cases, 0.8 million cases of dementia and 1.2 million of stroke, the study said.The costs of healthcare were highest for cancer (£4.4 billion) and lowest for dementia, at £1.4 billion, while stroke was £1.8 billion.But researchers found that the social care costs of dementia outweighed the social care costs of the other three conditions combined.And the combined costs of health and social care for dementia came to £11.6 billion in 2012, they calculated.This was more than double the equivalent costs for cancer at £5 billion, and significantly more than for stroke (£2.9 billion) and coronary heart disease (£2.5 billion).This means that for every £10 of health and social care costs attributable to each condition, £1.09 in research funding was spent on cancer, £0.65 on coronary heart disease, £0.20 on stroke, and just £0.07 went on dementia.The study, which is published in the British Medical Journal, said the amount of Government money pumped into dementia and stroke research in the UK has risen significantly in recent years, but the sums allocated by charities have scarcely changed since 2008.Its authors suggested public preferences towards cancer charities might be due to people seeing dementia and stroke as inevitable aspects of ageing compared to cancer and heart disease."Although there has been much progress by Government to increase levels of research funding for dementia and stroke, these areas remain underfunded when compared with the burden of disease," the study concluded.Hilary Evans, director of external affairs at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: "While there have been welcome moves to increase Government funding for dementia research in recent years, these figures show that research into the condition still needs greater investment in proportion to its impact on society."Alzheimer's Research UK is leading the way in tackling this challenge - since 2008, we have more than doubled our annual commitment to research and we have ambitious plans to do more."Research is making real progress, but we need to see a commitment from all quarters to ensure that the advances being made can be harnessed to help transform lives. It will be vital for the next government to make dementia research a priority if we are to defeat the condition once and for all."
Chinese tourist, Jing Cao, appeared in the Dunedin District Court on Tuesday morning pleading guilty to dangerous driving charges which resulted in the death of a five-year-old Oamaru girl.Cao, 32, admitted charges of dangerous driving causing the death of Ruby Jay Marris and five counts of dangerous driving causing injury to Tristan Guy Marris, Kimberley Louise Marris, Sophie Marris, Georgia Marris and Hoo Li Jian.Ruby died in a head-on crash near the Moeraki boulders on February 21, late on a Saturday afternoon, about 200 metres north of the turnoff to Moeraki township on State Highway 1 between Oamaru and Dunedin.Judge K Phillips told Cao, through an interpreter, to prepare himself for a custodial sentence.Defence lawyer Anne Stevens called for a home detention sentence, but Judge Phillips said a full time custodial sentence would send a stronger message.He was remanded on bail until 9 June for sentencing.
Tauranga Police are growing more and more frustrated with avoidable crashes happening on Western Bay of Plenty roads.Yesterday, police attended several calls to crashes, with Whakamarama and Omanawa Roads proving to be double trouble.A car rolled and hit a bank on Omanawa Road this morning. This is the second time in as many days that this has happened, with a crash at the same spot yesterday.Acting Senior Sergeant Phil Gillbanks says police were called to a car that had slid off the road at Whakamarama yesterday morning.“While we were in attendance another one left the road as well, on a slippery corner,” says Phil.“There was another yesterday on Omanawa Road where a vehicle left the road, hit a bank and rolled. At the same place today, there was a second one.”Phil says there were a few incidents yesterday because of the slippery roads following a dumping of rain.There was a crash at an intersection in Mount Maunganui and another off Maleme Street as well.“People need to drive to the conditions,” adds Phil. “Remember that even when the rain stops, the road is still wet.“You have to watch your following distances and your braking before corners - you don't want to be braking in a corner.”Phil warns that crashes resulting from speed or any other driving offence could likely, at the very least, face a charge of careless driving and that will go through the court process.“Which means there will be a fine decided by the courts and there can also be a disqualification,” he says.“The biggest frustration I have is that drivers are just not paying attention to what they're doing when they're driving.”
Two teenagers who robbed a Mr Whippy owner at gunpoint in Auckland remain on the run, police say.The youths approached the woman just after 3pm on Sunday while she was parked by the Michael Joseph Savage Memorial in Orakei.They allegedly pointed a pistol at the woman and threatened to "put a hole" in her if she did not hand over her cash.They then fled towards Mission Bay with a bag of cash and bank cards, police said.A police spokeswoman said inquiries were carried out yesterday, but the two offenders remained at large.
An increase in burglaries in Raumati and Raumati South has prompted a warning from Kapiti police.Acting Senior Sergeant Chanel Chapman said police believed a group of people were targeting mainly garages and cars parked in driveways overnight in the area.Chapman said they were stealing mountain bikes, tools from garages, clothing, cash, sunglasses and other items that they could carry away and get rid of quickly.She warned local residents to be vigilant about locking cars parked in driveways and avoid leaving valuables inside.Police wanted to hear about any suspicious behaviour in the neighbourhood, Chapman said.
But traffic fell back slightly at Aberdeen Airport following a "modest reduction" in international passenger numbers.Glasgow Airport said 606,000 travellers passed through its gates in March, a 14 per cent increase on the same month last year. It was the airport's busiest March in seven years, and comes after 510,665 passengers used the airport in February - 13.9 per cent more than in February 2014.Glasgow highlighted strong demand for flights to European destinations as international passenger numbers grew 22.3 per cent in March to 267,989. British Airways, Flybe and Loganair reported an appetite for services to London and other regional UK destinations as domestic traffic through Glasgow rose 8.2 per cent to 338,128.A spokesman said the growth was driven by securing new routes alongside a strong underlying performance, as evidenced by the growth in domestic traffic. He said traffic was boosted brought by the Davis Cup tennis matches at the Emirates Arena and the European Atherosclerosis Society Congress, which attracted 2,000 delegates, adding that the World Gymnastic and IPC Swimming championships and Turner Prize will drive numbers as the year progresses.In March Glasgow launched a new flight to Carcassone in France, a twice daily service to Bournemouth, and restored Virgin Atlantic's direct flight to Florida on the 747 aircraft. Further routes are also in the pipeline, with Flybe introducing a direct flight to Cardiff in June, and Wizz Air to begin serving Budapest, the Hungarian capital, and the Polish city of Lublin from later this summer. In addition, Canada's WestJet will begin a daily service to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Thomas Cook will start flying to Las Vegas next month.Amanda McMillan, managing director, said: "2015 has got off to a tremendous start and we are continuing to enjoy significant increases in our passenger numbers as a result of our popular and growing list of destinations."Our international network continues to grow from strength to strength and over the next three months we will see the launch of a further 13 new routes."Edinburgh Airport saw a total of 791,975 travellers pass through its doors last month - up 6.8 per cent on last March.Domestic passenger numbers grew 8.7 per cent to 432,935, driven by Ryanair's new four-time daily service to Stansted. Edinburgh also highlighted the impact of Flybe's new service to London City, which operates four times a day, and the increased frequency of BA Cityflyer's service to the same airport, now running up top 12 times a day.International passenger numbers at Edinburgh were up 4.7 per cent on March last year at 359,040.The figures were boosted by increased services to Dublin, Barcelona and Rome with Ryanair, a new twice weekly service to Madeira with easyJet, which has also increased services to Lisbon and Reykjavik. Recent services introduced by the airport include routes to the Faroe Islands with Atlantic Airways, Malaga with Norwegian, Copenhagen with SAS and Madrid with Iberia Express.Gordon Dewar, chief executive, said: "March was a strong month for us and we saw a significant increase in the number of passengers travelling through our airport."Aberdeen Airport said 284,755 passengers passed through its gates in March, down 1.5 per cent last year. Helicopter traffic grew 3.1 per cent and domestic travel was up 0.8 per cent, offset by a "minor reduction" in international traffic.
(Reuters) - Ahead of the May 7 election, in which Labour Party and Prime Minister David Cameron's incumbent Conservative Party are neck-and-neck in polls, Deutsche Bank said in a research note that the Labour Party is most likely be able to form the next government.Deutsche Bank's chief economist, George Buckley, said in the research note that all polls indicate a hung parliament, meaning that a three-party coalition will be required to form a government, and Labour is expected to win support from the Scottish National Party.The Scottish National Party, which has drawn a sharp rise in support following last year's independence referendum, is expected to get about 47 percent of Scottish votes this election compared with 20 percent vote in the 2010 elections, according to polls over the past month.The Labour Party may fetch only about 27 percent of the vote share, compared with 42 percent in the 2010 elections in Scotland, polls show.The outcome of such a mandate for Labour may result in increased taxes, less austerity and likely a slower reduction in the deficit.If a Conservative-led government is formed, it will press ahead for an EU referendum by 2017, which may present a serious test of the resilience of foreign direct investment to the UK, and would likely depress the currency as a result, Deutsche Bank said in the research note.
Many believe the gang that stole gems, gold and cash worth £200million have been good for business.They say tourists are pouring through the doors to quiz shop owners about the bank holiday raid at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit building in central London.Harry Karaca, manager at Channings, said: “I wish it had never happened but I think people have realised that we are here now. If anything it has been busier, people are interested.”Another shop manager said: “We have not seen any negative impact, I think it may even help long-term.” Another worker said he had been told most of the safe boxes raided belonged to private customers rather than jewellery shops.Police have released CCTV images of the gang wearing high-viz jackets and hard hats as they spent the weekend emptying safety deposit boxes.
Hard graft: We spend 10,000 hours commuting in our lives, work longer hours than our European neighbours – and human resources staff are most likely to kiss at an office partyIf you’ve ever found yourself staring at the clock during a monotonous meeting you are very far from alone. In fact the average worker has to put up with this 6,240 times during their career.So, it’s little wonder that one in five of us admit to making a mistake after losing concentration during a meeting.

A drug rehabilitation provider is urging the Federal Government to create more treatment facilities in the state's west as part of a push to address ice addiction.Federal Health Minister Sussan Ley says the new national taskforce on ice, announced by Prime Minister Tony Abbott last week, will prioritise rural and regional Australia.But Minister Ley has said that treatment centres in the far west are not necessarily the answer, saying it can be preferrable for people dealing with addiction to get out of town.Norm Henderson from the Orana Haven Rehabiliation Centre near Brewarrina says while it can be helpful getting treatment away from home, there's no doubt Broken Hill needs a facility."The far west is definitely underserviced, and especially rehabiliation services," he said."They definitely need to start somewhere and, yeah, I would say that west of Cowra would be a good start because there's not a lot of services this way."Mr Henderson's comments echo calls from a group of parents affected by their children's drug use.Criminal defence lawyers in Broken Hill have also said that better access to rehabilitation facilities could help reduce crime rates.The far west's state member, Kevin Humphries, has told the ABC that the scale of the problem doesn't appear to warrant a residential centre, but said he's open to talks on the issue.
Calgary small business owners say they welcome changes to the code of conduct governing credit and debit card transaction that will make it less expensive for them to operate.Revisions announced Monday by federal Finance Minister Joe Oliver will allow merchants to opt out of contracts if their credit card processor raises rates or fails to pass on savings. The code will also now apply to mobile payments and credit card processors can only auto-renew a contract for up to six months, meaning fewer merchants will be locked into bad contracts.“Business owners have been concerned about the rising credit costs for some time, especially with premium cards,” said Amber Ruddy, senior policy analyst with the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. “There’s better disclosure, more enhanced dispute settlements. These new rules are something that’s definitely welcomed by independent business owners across the board.”Visa and MasterCard struck a voluntary agreement with the government last November. Under the deal, both companies agreed to limit how much they charge retailers for the next five years to 1.5 per cent of the value of the transaction. Revisions to the code aim to ensure merchants benefit, with a requirement that savings from the reduced credit and debit card fees are fully passed on to merchants..“If it’s actually going to happen it’s going to be fantastic,” said Jaime Sanderson, the owner of Babes in Arms in Bridgeland.“There’s hardly any margins for small business. A huge portion of our overhead ends up going to these credit card bills — like $10,000 last year kind of thing. Six to 20 per cent change will make a big difference,” she said.“Locally we’re watching baby stores specifically — because that’s what we specialize in — close their doors all the time. I want to say that in the last five years I’ve probably watched eight to 10 different competitors (close their doors). We want to be the store that doesn’t close its doors.”Carter Thomson, owner of One Way Foods, a convenience store in Sunalta, said a reduction in fees isn’t quite enough.“The fact that they can take 1.5 per cent for processing a payment is pretty substantial,” he said. “Some of our stuff we work on is such a slim margin … When somebody pays with their debit it costs me a nickel. For credit cards, it’s going to be closer to 1.5 per cent. It was like 1.75 per cent before. It’s not that significant. They’re still letting the credit card companies run rampant on small business.”The revised code also requires fees and contract terms to be disclosed more clearly and allows merchants to exit contracts with credit card processors without penalty.Scott Crockatt, of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, said the organization welcomes changes that help small business competitiveness.“Credit card processing fees can be one of the major expenses that we certainly hear about from small businesses and over the last number of years there’s been some escalation in those fees,” said Crockatt. “So I think that these positive steps on the code of conduct could really move things forward on helping our businesses be more competitive.“The businesses that we hear about concerns over credit cards and processing fees most frequently from are certainly small businesses who oftentimes are watching every percentage point of margin.”Crockatt noted the code of conduct is voluntary, though he expects the larger credit card companies will comply.The new requirement for credit card companies to clearly identify “premium” reward cards with higher fees is also good news, but the cost issues still have not been addressed, said Restaurants Canada.“Merchants must still accept all cards,” Joyce Reynolds, executive vice-president of government affairs, said in a news release. “Ultimately, it’s the merchants and their customers, regardless of how they pay for their meal, who foot the bill for the travel and rewards of the premium cardholders.”With files from The Canadian Press
TORONTO — Child pornography files found on a computer belonging to a man who was once deputy education minister for Ontario and Manitoba were described in graphic detail Monday as his sentencing hearing got underway in a Toronto courtroom.Benjamin Levin pleaded guilty to three child pornography-related charges last month. The 63-year-old was originally charged with seven child porn-related offences.The Toronto police detective who led the investigation into Levin was called as a Crown witness and described a number of files found on Levin's computer, which were considered child pornography.The images themselves, and two videos, were shown only to the judge presiding over the case, but court heard that all of them involved girls under the age of 18, with many of them considered pre-pubescent.Levin took notes and kept his eyes cast downward as the files found on his computer were described.In a written statement distributed by his lawyer, he has said he's "deeply ashamed" of his actions.A forensic psychiatrist, called to testify Monday by Levin's lawyer, determined in an assessment that Levin had a "pedophilic interest in children" but that his behaviours were at "a fantasy level," court heard.Levin had "distorted beliefs" that his fantasies were harmless, but he did not engage in any "hands on" sexual abuse, said Dr. Julian Gojer.The risk in Levin's behaviour was the impact his fantasies may have had with the people he discussed them with online, Gojer suggested."He's talked about sadistic acts involving children," Gojer said. "There is a concern that the behaviour this man engaged in had the potential to cause some children harm."Levin's lawyer, Clayton Ruby, noted, however, that among the about 2,000 pornographic images found on Levin's computer, only a small portion — some 14 images and two videos — were found to be child pornography.When asked to comment on that observation Gojer said the numbers indicated that from a visual perspective, Levin had a limited interest in child pornography."This individual's fantasies were fuelled more by chats," he said.Court has heard that Levin used to frequent an online website with numerous chatrooms for the discussion of sexual activities.His profile on the site was created in 2010 and indicated his sexuality as "nothing is taboo."Among the people he chatted with were an undercover officer in Toronto, one in London, Ont., and one in New Zealand — all posing as women interested in sexual activities with children.Court heard that while Levin didn't think the profiles of the undercover officers were real, he didn't ask or suggest if they were fake, nor did he explicitly suggest that his exchanges with them were intended to be pure fantasy.Levin counselled his online chat partners to sexually assault their children, court heard. He "normalized and encouraged the sexual touching of the girls by their mother," court heard through a statement of facts.Levin was arrested in July 2013 when a search warrant was executed at his home. Police found numerous child pornography files on a digital device.Police at the time asked any victims of Levin to come forward, but, court heard "to date no one has done so."
Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls contradicted Jim Murphy’s claim that no spending cuts would be needed after 2016. In a further blow, Shadow Business Secretary Chukka Umunna appeared to tell Mr Murphy to know his place when asked about the issue in a TV interview. The damaging Labour split on balancing the books overshadowed UK leader Ed Milliband’s manifesto launch in which he promised not to borrow a penny more and to cut the deficit. The document contained just two paragraphs on extra powers for Holyrood and Mr Miliband made only a fleeting six-word reference to Scotland in his speech. The SNP –  riding high in the polls  – last night seized on the rift and claimed Mr Murphy had been “hung out to dry”. In a TV debate last Tuesday the former Scottish Secretary promised that Labour would not need to make “further cuts to achieve our spending rules” in the next parliament. He claimed projections by the Institute of Fiscal Studies meant that, as well as bringing spending reductions to a halt, there would be scope to increase spending on government departments by £9.2billon by 2020. Mr Balls undermined his colleague yesterday saying he could not guarantee Scotland would be exempt from spending cuts if he became the next Chancellor. In an interview, Mr Balls said the party’s proposal for a mansion tax on homes worth £2million or more would deliver £800million for Scotland.But he went on: “Whether or not the overall Scottish budget is cut depends upon whether or not that £800million, which is financed and extra, is more than or less than our unplanned cuts – and that will depend upon the scale of the unplanned cuts.“I can’t say to Scotland that you’ll be exempt from spending cuts in the unprotected areas, but they’re sensible and they are absolutely in marked contrast to what the Tories are proposing – because they want to have double the spending cuts next year than last year – and also the SNP, because what we exposed last week is that the SNP won’t match our manifesto pledges and their fiscal autonomy within the UK is actually fiscal austerity in the UK.“It would mean a massive cut to spending in Scotland.”Mr Murphy later insisted he and Mr Balls had been clear a Labour government would “have to make savings” north and south of the Border, but he suggested these need not continue beyond 2015/16.But speaking on BBC’s Daily Politics, Mr Umunna, far right, said: “The leader of the Scottish Labour party will not be in charge of the UK budget. The leader of the country, the next Prime Minister, Ed Miliband, will be in charge of the UK budget.”SNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “The truth is out about Labour spending cuts. Jim Murphy’s false claims in the TV debates have been rubbished by his own Westminster bosses, who have hung him out to dry.“Labour would impose swingeing spending cuts on Scotland and the rest of the UK, carrying on with austerity where the Tories left off.“That is the core aspect of their manifesto.”Tory leader Ruth Davidson said: “Yesterday, Jim Murphy said that there would be no further cuts for Scotland.“Today Ed Balls has confirmed that there would be. Jim Murphy has had the rug pulled from under his feet by a panicking and shambolic party which seems to have given up on Scotland.”The row over spending came as questions were being asked about Labour’s pledge to reduce the deficit every year and not borrow anything extra for new policies.Mr Miliband refused to say whether this included capital spending while Mr Umunna said it would.Institute for Fiscal Studies director Paul Johnson said that, as Labour had not indicated how quickly it intended to achieve its objective, it was unclear what spending cuts or tax rises would be needed.“The big unknown on the Labour side is how fast they want to get there and therefore do they need significant spending cuts or tax rises at all,” he said.
Teenagers will be encouraged to learn foreign languages by talking about tattoos, music festivals, YouTube and rap music under the latest GCSE shake-up.Exam board officials yesterday unveiled a draft syllabus for 14 to 16-year-olds which they said would ‘make content more contemporary’.Some students will be asked to study a review of a gritty 15-rated foreign film, while others will look at Spanish tweets on the Olympic Games.The proposals, announced by Oxford, Cambridge and RSA Examinations (OCR), aim to rid classrooms of ‘tired phrases’ which some pupils now see as outdated.The board said children were ‘uninspired’ by conventional topics like ‘my school day’, ‘my pencil case’ and ‘my family’.It said the new French, German and Spanish GCSEs would allow pupils to talk about their interests using updated content.Exam board officials also hope to ‘bring back linguistic skills’ by focusing on grammar as a component of an indispensable language ‘toolkit’.OCR languages expert Katherine Smith said: ‘This entails moving away from working too long on a clichéd topic until a student is bored with it, to working on more appealing subjects, and with an all-important shift in emphasis on the skills that they can transfer across content.‘Current GCSE specifications have focused on preparing coursework which is more about the theme than learning the building blocks of a language.‘This has de-skilled students and led to ‘topic fatigue’. Our new approach should fundamentally improve both the student’s enjoyment and their linguistic ability.’The course content, which has now been submitted to Ofqual for approval, would be studied by pupils from 2016.The board said it had disposed of old topics including ‘My holiday’, ‘Aurélie and Fabian go to town’ or ‘Mathilde’s school day’.One teacher at an OCR teacher consultation said: ‘Students are not really going to meet somebody in a café in Paris and describe their entire family.’Pupils would no longer be forced to recite phrases like ‘I have a grapefruit every morning’ and instead would be able to express views such as ‘In my opinion a discreet tattoo is an expression of your personality’.In the new draft German GCSE, there is a film review of the thriller Run Lola Run, which is rated 15 and features some mild violence.In the Spanish GCSE, students will be asked to look at tweets on the Olympic Games.Other proposed content includes listening to a radio broadcast on rap music and discussing online gaming and YouTube.Experts said the new content would take inspiration from methods used to teach English as a foreign language.Literature extracts will be also be studied at the request of the Department for Education, including passages from an Ionesco play.OCR also wants to abandon inflexible vocabulary lists and encourage pupils to use a smart app to help them memorise words.Ms Smith added: ‘While language teachers are pulling their hair out as their student numbers decline with languages not prioritised by the current system, captains of industry are also deeply frustrated.‘We are passionate about getting these three core language GCSEs right to help the UK build a generation of people with the language skills that are so desperately needed.’
The Unite union claims the hand-held devices used by wardens in Aberdeen to issue parking tickets are also tracking their movements.The dispute started last year after two workers were suspended when managers used information on a computer to challenge them over their whereabouts.Now union members are to vote on industrial action after rejecting the outcome of the council’s investigation into the monitoring scheme.Unite regional officer Tommy Campbell said: “We are now in a formal trades dispute because the members have overwhelmingly voted to reject the outcome of the investigation report.“In particular they reject the explanation given about the reasons why their comfort breaks were being monitored and recorded.“This is a reflection of how angry the wardens are at the way they are managed.“The anger of our members has been caused by the council delaying the outcome of their long-standing investigation into the monitoring and spying of their own staff.”
Will we really see each and every property owner or Khao Yai landholder being “probed” on their land deeds, regardless of their influence or political and social connections?It would certainly be a great leap forward for Thailand if impartiality indeed became the driving force from the top but, until now, there has been no sign that this will ever happen.Drug gangs have always​ been a key factor influencing the protracted violen​ce in the deep South, at least since I have been here, dating back before 2004.That explains the strong police and drug enforcement presence in Songkhla. The gangs only embrace Islam and separatism as a way to mistakenly justify their actions.Their money comes from the drug trade and the gangs will push to continue their lucrative trade, both here and in the ready market south of the Thailand border.It was ridiculous and shameful of the DCA to issue a warning over the cancellation of two flights to Japan. The department is not in a position to threaten to revoke licences or threaten carriers and should instead concentrate on cleaning up its own house.The abrupt cancellations were not the carriers’ will; they were forced to abort flights due to the destination country’s disapproval.The controversy is not the carriers' fault. It is the result of the department’s poor administration over Thai airline operations.From an Asian perspective, helping another person “save face” — even if that person is somewhat of an adversary — builds friendships.US President Barack Obama’s political opponents back home are desperately attacking him on all fronts, and at this moment he needs a friend more than ever, as per the old saying, “A friend in need is a friend indeed”.From a self-interested perspective, Thais might consider helping Mr Obama “save face” in Southeast Asia.After boarding a bus from Bangkok to Pattaya, the driver stopped the bus before departing the bus terminal at Ekkamai, and reminded passengers to fasten their seatbelts.But this was notably absent on the return trip from Pattaya to Bangkok. Plaudits to the Bangkok driver, whether it was company policy or he was just a very switched-on driver, alert to the safety of his passengers.It is a step in the right direction, Thailand.I couldn’t agree more with Charlie Stampfer’s letter “Cut out the waste bag”, (BP, April 11). Thailand could be renamed “The Land of the Plastic Bag” instead of the “The Land of Smiles”. Styrofoam abounds with little or no respect for the environment as it is generally accepted to “toss it” without a further thought.Meanwhile, farang are fined for dropping cigarette butts in the Sukhumvit area, possibly as a badge of honour to show that Thais care about waste and rubbish.Yet canals, beaches, roadsides and vacant land lots remain a repository for rubbish.Now that Hillary Clinton has announced her candidacy for US president, I think her theme for the campaign should be “TED”. Why “TED”, you ask?“TED” stands for Thomas E Dewey, who ran for president and lost so many times that people lost count. It seems that Hillary is now heading down that same path.Thai Post, don’t get me started.

New franchise operator Abellio is overhauling ScotRail's Club 55 - a cut price fares offer developed by First Group for over 55s - ahead of an official launch in autumn.The revamped off-peak scheme, named Club 50, will run all year round and be expanded to include anyone aged 50 plus.However, passenger groups warn that there are also drawbacks which will see some journeys become considerably more expensive.Under First Group, Club 55 ran three times per year, typically for periods of two to three months at a time. It was first launched in 2010 and was widely praised for its ease of use and generous discounts, quickly becoming ScotRail's most popular deal.Passengers aged over 55 could turn up at any station, provide proof of age and buy a standard class off-peak fare between any two stations throughout Scotland for £19 return. They could also travel first-class for only £35 return, as long as the seat was booked by 6pm the day before.In comparison, Club 50 requires all tickets to be reserved in advance online.To qualify passengers will also have to pay an annual membership fee of £15 - or £10 if registering online - which entitles them to 20 per cent off fares.In some cases this means the cost of travel under Club 50 will be more than twice what it was under Club 55.For example, a first-class return between Glasgow Queen Street and Aberdeen costing £102.80 which would have been available to Club 55 customers for only £35, will now cost £82.24.Similarly, a standard-class return between Edinburgh Waverley and Inverness costing £52.10, previously available for £19 through Club 55, will cost Club 50 members £41.68.Bruce Williamson, spokesman for the campaign group Railfuture, said: "It's swings and roundabouts. Obviously we welcome the plus sides, but we're not too happy about the downsides. It's disappointing that some of the best aspects of it have been lost."Fares are always a big issue for passengers and we'd obviously welcome any reduction in prices, but sadly some of the best deals have gone."They're basically giving with one hand and taking away with the other."A number of journeys will remain largely unchanged, however. A weekday off-peak return between Edinburgh and Glasgow costing £23.10 will actually be around 50 pence cheaper under Club 50 - £18.48 compared to the previous £19 flat fare.Others, such as a day trip from Glasgow to Oban, will become slightly more expensive - costing around £23.20 return under Club 50 compared to £19 previously.John McCormick, chairman of the Scottish Association for Public Transport, said the majority of older passengers would be better off investing in a Senior Railcard, the national concessionary scheme which offers over-60s a third off most fares in exchange for an annual £30 fee.He added: "I suspect most people would have rather had the old system where it was £19 to go anywhere and you just turned up. The ease of use, the prices, and fact that you didn't have to pay any upfront membership fee were very good."I think 20 per cent off is quite disappointing."ScotRail said the new scheme will include other perks such as free registration for the national 'Bike & Go' cycle hire scheme, which normally costs £10.A spokeswoman for ScotRail said: "We've talked to customers across Scotland, and there is clear demand for cheaper off-peak travel all year round, for friends and family members who are younger than 55."We are still finalising details but we aim to run additional promotions on top of the core offer, which will make this membership scheme well worth having."

Liquidators of a failed milk exporting company, which became insolvent after losing an unfair dismissal case with employees, may force the company's Chinese-based directors to pay back $145,200 to creditors.NCF International was tipped into liquidation last June, after former shareholders and employees David Cardno and Jan Wolyncewicz won an unfair dismissal case and were awarded $83,408 by the employment court in January 2014 (Judgment (PDF here)), according to a ShephardDunphy liquidators report by Iain Bruce Shephard and Heath Leslie Gair. The company was set up by Chinese and New Zealand-based investors, to export milk into China, with Wolyncewicz and Cardno employed for "their expertise in food exportation and marketing".Chinese investment in New Zealand, particularly in the agriculture sector, has been growing, as the world's most populous country looks to secure its food supply. Earlier this year, the farming arm of Shanghai Pengxin Group, which is owned by Chinese billionaire Jiang Zhoabai, said it plans to double its $500 million of local assets within the next five years.Wolyncewicz and Cardno still hold 2.5 percent of NCF each, but ceased being directors in April 2013, while in March 2014 NCF's China-based directors Bing Li, Lai Yebin, Guo Xiaohai, Chen Junliang resigned as directors, leaving Wellington-based Fu Bihua as the sole director, according to records on the Companies Office website.After the legal stoush, NCF assets were transferred to a related company and cornerstone shareholder, Pairua Investment Group, which is jointly owned by former directors of NCF, Li and Yebin. Prior to the transfer of NCF assets to Pairua, $145,200 was paid to China-based directors in February, in what appears to be a voidable transaction, meaning liquidators Shephard and Gair can claw it back for creditors, they said.NCF had no secured creditors. Liquidators have received a preferential claim from Inland Revenue for $15,189, on top of Wolyncewicz and Cardno's $83,408 claims, while five unsecured creditors have claimed $49,759. So far liquidators have sold $1,725 worth of office furniture, while the NCF bank balance prior to liquidation was $60.18.

Whether it's a chocolate bar that no longer satisfies your appetite or washing powder which now runs out before your next shop, many of our big brands are shrinking their products.The latest casualty are boxes of Cadbury's Fingers which, it was announced yesterday, will contain two fewer chocolate fingers from now on.They join Creme Eggs, PG Tips teabags and even John West tuna in the ever-increasing list of goods getting smaller.But while it may be better for your waistline, it's not better for your pocket if manufacturers and supermarkets don't pass on the cost saving to consumers.When John West shrunk its No Drain Tuna Steak In Brine from 130g to 120g, the price stayed at £1 in Morrisons. And there was no change in the £5 cost of Surf with Essential Oils Washing Powder when it dropped from 2kg to 1.61kg.It's seemingly part of a strategy across the retail industry that enables manufacturers to increase profits without putting up prices (and thus risk losing customers).It's now so common, it's even got a name: 'shrinkflation'.In its latest issue, consumer watchdog Which? reveals a host of products that have been shrunk, from Surf washing powder and Cif spray to Hovis Best Of Both bread, while the price remains the same.'Shrinking products can be an underhand way of raising prices because pack sizes shrink but the prices don't.Consumers will feel angry that they are being short-changed by some of their favourite brands,' says Which? executive director Richard Lloyd. 'It's time for action on dodgy pricing practices that stop people from comparing products to find the cheapest.'It's fiendishly difficult to compare prices properly nowadays because special offers mean they change frequently. Indeed, very often a negative story about a product shrinking in the media will lead to its price magically shrinking.For example, after being featured in Which? this month because it had dropped from 750ml to 700ml but stayed at the same £2 price in Asda, the supermarket giant discounted Cif Actifizz Lemon Multi Purpose Spray to £1.75.F ood industry commentator Martin Isark believes the shrinking ploy is becoming more widespread. 'It's now common practice among the big confectioners and their argument is that they reduce the size so they don't have to put the prices up,' he says.'Ping-pong prices going up and down almost daily confuse the shopper so the brands can reduce the size without the customer ever realising.'Most of us buy on price, which is why they get away with this.'Other confectionery goods that have gone the same way as Cadbury's Fingers include Mars Bars (down from an original bumper 58g to 48g since 2013), Kit Kat Chunky (down from 48g to 40g earlier this year) and in 2011, the tins of Cadbury's Roses chocolates shrank from 975g to 850g, the equivalent loss of 11 chocolates.Sometimes, changes are obvious, such as Cadbury altering the shape of its chocolate. On other occasions, the clues are more subtle — a pasta sauce taking less time to warm suggests you are getting less of it.Angus Kennedy, editor of trade magazine Kennedy's Confection, says one of the worst examples of shrinkflation was Cadbury's reducing the number of Creme Eggs in a box from half-a-dozen to five in the run-up to Easter (both sizes cost £1 at Iceland).'If these companies said: 'We're sorry but we have no choice but to do this because cocoa is now in short supply,' then I think the British public would be much more understanding,' he says. 'What we don't like is feeling duped when we realise what the companies are up to.'Especially when they're still paying £1 for a sharing bag of Maltesers that's down from 140g to 120g (in fact, Cadbury's fingers have gone up from £1 to £1.50 in Sainsbury's this year despite the shrinkage).Confectionery companies have argued that a reduction in the size of their bars is not all about rising production costs but is also an attempt to support the Government's drive to help people lose weight in the face of an obesity epidemic.Mr Kennedy disputes this, saying that as the bars get smaller, people are likely to just buy and eat more. Manufacturers often claim that, when they reduce the size of a product, they pass on savings to shops but cannot guarantee that they will, in turn, bring down retail prices.Firms that were approached by Which? were unwilling to go into specifics, saying the information was 'confidential'.Vince Bamford, buying and supply editor of The Grocer, says shrinkflation has taken off because suppliers are under pressure to maintain profit margins to keep shareholders happy and believe consumers prefer smaller products to price increases.'When we were in recession, suppliers and retailers were very wary of raising prices,' he says.'But I don't think it would do them any harm to be more honest with consumers. To say: 'We're having to pay 10 per cent more for our products and we're having to pass some of that cost on to you.' ''Food and drink pricing always reflects the economic climate of the day, whether that's the impact of changing utility prices or ingredient costs, which can be volatile,' says a Food And Drink Federation spokesperson.'Businesses seek to offset these costs wherever possible through improvements in efficiency and productivity, but these actions can only go so far, and in some cases companies will reduce the pack size rather than increasing the price for consumers.'However, it's the underhand way in which these product changes appear to be introduced that leaves a bad taste in the mouths of so many.
MIAMI -- In his presidential campaign kickoff speech Monday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) used language reminiscent of another big speech from over a decade ago that catapulted President Obama -- then a state senator -- onto the national stage."I know my candidacy might seem improbable to some watching from abroad. After all, in many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country. ... where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power."And here's Obama giving the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention:"Let me express my deepest gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me, because, let's face it: My presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. ... My parents shared not only an improbable love, they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation."This isn't the first time a comparison has been drawn between Rubio and Obama. As many people have noted, both decided to run for president as relatively new senators at a relatively young age.Of course policy-wise, they are very different. Rubio staunchly opposes some of Obama's signature achievements, like his federal health-care law. The Republican is also a sharp critic of Obama's foreign policy toward Cuba and Iran.The list of differences goes on and on. And Rubio himself has rejected the comparison to the president."I think they’ll also hopefully look for someone who has more of a track record than just a handful of years as a backbencher in the state legislature followed by a handful of years in the Senate, not having, not really doing anything serious about any major issues," Rubio told Hugh Hewitt in February. "As I look at my own considerations, I’m reminded that I served nine years in the Florida legislature, the third-largest state in the country. I was its presiding officer for two years, and also ran the Florida House from an administrative point of view ...."But it's worth noting that stylistically, Rubio is using a version of the rhetoric Obama used. It is rhetoric that is both optimistic about America and seeks to send a message to voters that he is not just like every other Republican.
The Lagos State chapter of the All Progressives Congress said it owed its victory in the Saturday governorship poll to Lagos residents, who voted for its candidate to further entrench the culture of excellence in the state.The APC on Monday, in statement by its Lagos State Publicity Secretary, Mr. Joe Igbokwe, said Lagos residents deserved thanks for not succumbing to intimidation from the opposition.Igbokwe said the alignment between Lagos and the government at the centre would better the lot of the state.He said, “Lagos APC appreciates Lagosians for their unflinching support, we celebrate their courage and steadfastness, we honour their patriotic disposition to continuity, we value so much their sense of judgement and the power of their strategic political decision at a time like this.“In the face of harassment, intimidation and brigandage from the powers that be, APC lovers showed infectious and contagious love to the party and its leaders they have known for years now.“APC lovers in Lagos did not succumb to blatant lies, hate campaigns, politics of the stomach, ethnic and tribal politics and politics of naira, dollar and pound sterling.“They were not swayed because they understand what is at stake. They did not see these inducements as low hanging fruits to take advantage of. They were smart, courageous and determined to use the power of votes to sustain the intelligent leadership and governance in Lagos.”Igbokwe added, “We appreciate Lagosians for understanding the urgent need at this critical point in the nation’s history to connect Lagos effectively to Abuja. Lagosians saw this great opportunity and grabbed it with both hands and the rest is now history.“We have no doubt in our mind that the synergy between Abuja and Lagos will add great values to the project Nigeria and consequently make our country to remain credit positive in many years to come.”Copyright PUNCH.

Mr Chris Nemedia, a former Director of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), says further inclusion of more Nigerians in the nation’s tax bracket would leverage revenue and improve the ratings.Nemedia said in an interview with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that government effort at expanding the nation’s tax bracket was encouraging.“When huge funds are gotten from tax, the revenue will impact the present national Gross Domestic Products and reverse the negative economic ratings.“It is a known fact that taxation and funds generated from it will always complement revenue projections from crude oil,” he said.He also said that government’s sustained effort at curbing the scourge of corruption and plugging all the wastages would increase Nigeria’s favourable rating.Mr Bright Okwu, an economist, said that the nation’s poor rating would soon come to past, if the three tiers of government fixed the key critical infrastructure needed for sustained economic growth.Okwu, who is also the President, Small Holders Farmers and Youth Network of Nigeria, said that coordinated confrontation on corruption at all levels of government would turn around the pessimistic rating of Nigeria.“Fighting the scourge of corrupt practices to a halt by enhancing the operations of the anti-graft agency will go a long way to remedy the nation’s negative outlook.“Taking care of corruption nationally will address about 50 per cent of the challenges confronting most sectors of the economy,” he said.“Building up intuitions cannot be over emphasised, as it is one of the pivotal tool for any government to function effectively.“It is one of the crucial pillars that have continued to transform many of the countries of the West and place them on a good pedestal, “he said.NAN recalled that Fitch, an international rating agency, recently revised Nigeria’s credit rating outlook from stable to negative, warning that declining crude oil price might force the nation’s current account into deficit.Fitch identified major factors associated with rating downgrade to include “a serious and prolonged breakdown in public order and erosion of fiscal and external buffers.Others include inadequate policy response that seriously undermines confidence and reversal of key structural reforms.
MOSCOW — President Vladimir Putin on Monday opened the way for Russia's delivery of a sophisticated air defence missile system to Iran, a move that would significantly bolster the Islamic republic's military capability.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry objected to Moscow's decision in a phone call to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and the White House indicated the move could endanger plans to ultimately lift sanctions on Iran as part of a final nuclear deal.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said unity and co-ordination with nations like Russia is critical to the success of the negotiations.Putin's move was quickly welcomed by Tehran, while it worried Israel, which saw it as a sign that Iran already had begun to cash in on the nuclear deal with world powers that is expected to be finalized by the end of June.Russia signed the $800-million contract to sell Iran the S-300 missile system in 2007, but suspended their delivery three years later because of strong objections from the United States and Israel. Putin on Monday lifted that ban.The preliminary agreement on settling the Iranian nuclear standoff reached earlier this month made the 2010 Russian ban unnecessary, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a televised statement.The deal reached by Iran and six world powers is intended to significantly restrict its ability to produce nuclear weapons while giving it relief from international sanctions. The agreement is supposed to be finalized by June 30, and there is no firm agreement yet on how or when to lift the international sanctions on Iran.The S-300 missile system, which has a range of up to 200 kilometres and the capability to track down and strike multiple targets simultaneously, is one of the most potent air defence weapons in the world."The S-300 is exclusively a defensive weapon, which can't serve offensive purposes and will not jeopardize the security of any country, including, of course, Israel," Lavrov said.Deployed in big numbers, the system could provide a strong deterrent against any air attack. If Israel decides to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, the S-300s would further complicate the already daunting task.Israeli Cabinet minister Yuval Steinitz said the framework nuclear agreement helped legitimize Iran and cleared the way for Monday's announcement by Russia.Israel has harshly criticized the U.S.-led nuclear deal, saying it would give Iran relief from sanctions while leaving its nuclear program largely intact. Israel believes Iran still intends to develop a nuclear weapon."This is a direct result of the legitimacy that Iran obtained from the emerging nuclear deal," Steinitz said. He added that the arms deal shows that Iran plans to use the relief from economic sanctions to buy arms, not improve the living conditions of its people."Instead of demanding Iran stop its terror activities that it spreads in the Middle East and the entire world, it is being allowed to arm itself with advanced weapons that will only increase its aggression," Steinitz said.Lavrov didn't say when Moscow could deliver the missiles. Russian officials previously said that the specific model of the S-300 that Russia was to deliver under the 2007 contract is no longer produced, and offered Iran a modified version of it called S-300VM, or Antey-2500.In Tehran, Gen. Reza Talaeinik said the decision by Russia on delivery of the air defence system will help improve ties between Tehran and Moscow, the semi-official Tasnim news agency, which is close to Iran's military, reported.
Air New Zealand has announced new plans to boost flights out of Christchurch to warmer climates, including Australia and the Pacific.The airline said on Tuesday it was adding 15,000 seats between Christchurch and Australian or Pacific Island destinations in the 2016 financial year.The news comes as a slight boost after previous announcements from the airline that it was cutting the last of Christchurch's long haul flights, and several regional routes.The largest increase was on the Christchurch to Fiji route, which the airline said would increase by almost 60 per cent in the next financial year.Capacity increases on trans-Tasman routes will include more than 4000 seats between Christchurch and Sydney, 3000  between Christchurch and Melbourne and more than 2000 between Christchurch and the Gold Coast.A spokeswoman for the airline said the capacity increases planned for Christchurch for the coming  year "reflect a strong domestic economy and the local rebuild activity," and the airline had plans for more domestic capacity coming in and out of Christchurch over the year.They would "announce domestic capacity increases in the next week which will also include significant benefits for Canterbury."The first additional services between Christchurch and Nadi or the Gold Coast would be operating from July, she said, and the additional capacity would focus on peak periods.Many Christchurch tourism operators were disappointed by Air NZ's March announcement it was cutting the last remaining long haul flights between Tokyo and Christchurch.In November last year Air NZ announced cuts to its regional services, including axing services to Westport, Kaitaia and Whakatane from April.
Literacy problem kept Gold Coast bikie behind bars because he couldn’t read lettersRicky Chapman, 26, appeared via video link in the Southport Magistrates Court yesterday charged with one count of supplying a dangerous drug to unknown persons.Solicitor Campbell MacCallum of Moloney MacCallum Lawyers said it was alleged that his client had supplied a small amount of cocaine between November 2012 and July 2013.He said Chapman was taken into custody in April last year but was refused bail as he was unable to raise a $50,000 surety. Mr MacCallum said Chapman changed to a solicitor from Sydney but then had no contact with that person.“He’s just been sitting there not really knowing what to do,” he said.Mr MacCallum, who represents Chapman on his riot charge in relation to the Broadbeach brawl, said he was concerned when he found out his client was still in custody.“I did write to him ... as it turns out he has difficulty with literacy and wasn’t understanding the letters ...”Magistrate Jacqueline Payne granted Chapman bail on the supply cocaine charge and he was committed to the Southport District Court for trial on a date to be fixed.Chapman also faces a mass trial next month for his alleged involvement in the bikie brawl.Solicitor Campbell MacCallum of Moloney MacCallum Lawyers told the court his client was taken into custody in April last year but was refused bail as he was unable to raise a $50,000 surety.Mr MacCallum said one month later Chapman changed lawyers then spent the next year in custody on remand.Magistrate Jacqueline Payne said Chapman had clearly served more time than he would have if convicted.Chapman was granted bail on his own undertaking and the charge was committed to the Southport District Court for trial on a date to be fixed.
The boss of property group GPT Michael Cameron will be in charge of financial services giant Suncorp when Patrick Snowball leaves in October.Mr Cameron, who has headed GPT for six years and been a Suncorp non-executive director since 2012, has 30 years of experience in finance and business.This includes senior leadership roles with Commonwealth Bank, NAB, St George, Lend Lease and Barclays.In February Mr Snowball, who has been chief executive for six years, revealed that the board was searching for a successor.He will finish his role in October and return to the UK, Suncorp confirmed."I remain focused on leading the team toward our full year result and look forward to working with Michael as he transitions into the group CEO role," Mr Snowball said."There's no overhaul required," he said."Patrick has done a fantastic job of turning the business around, fixing legacy problems, building an excellent team, and lifting performance."The naming of Mr Snowball's successor comes two months after Suncorp blamed a slowing economy for its decision to lower its growth forecasts.Chairman Ziggy Switkowski paid tribute to Mr Snowball for making Suncorp more efficient and strengthening its capital base."Today, we are a vastly improved diverse financial services business with good prospects and are providing attractive and sustainable returns to our shareholders," he said.
A rarely seen species of whale has been found washed up on a West Australian beach, giving scientists a chance to learn more about the animal.The Omura's whale was discovered on a remote Exmouth beach, at the tip of the state's North West Cape, after Tropical Cyclone Olwyn tore through the area last month.It is the first sighting of the species in WA and only the second in Australia.Identifying the 5.68m juvenile female was difficult for Department of Parks and Wildlife staff but DNA profiling confirmed it was an Omura's whale.Environment Minister Albert Jacob said the find was "highly significant" for whale scientists because very little was known about the species."Omura's whale was only described in scientific journals for the first time in 2003 and is apparently restricted to tropical and subtropical waters," he said."The knowledge we gain from this whale will help to improve field identification guides to better understand the whale's regional distribution."The species is usually found in Indonesian waters, the Philippines and the Sea of Japan.Omura's whales have a sleek body shape and several unique skeletal features, including 53 vertebrae and four digits on each pectoral fin.The carcass has been buried and the skeleton will be recovered in a few years for further scientific investigation and possibly for public display in museums.
On Sunday, Pope Francis took the audacious step of celebrating a Mass at St. Peter's Basilica to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the slaughter of 1.5 million Armenians, and then calling those killings by their name: genocide. For that, the Turkish government summoned the Vatican's envoy in Ankara for a talking-to and recalled its own ambassador to the Vatican for “consultation.” Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu announced that “the pope's statement, which is out of touch with both historical facts and legal basis, is simply unacceptable.”That's right: A full century after the mass killings by the Ottoman Empire, the Turkish government continues to reject the documented historical reality that Turkey was responsible for the first genocide in what turned out to be a century of grotesque ethnic, religious and political violence, from the Holocaust to the Cambodian killing fields to the Rwandan genocide.Turkey's disingenuous view compounds the original crime with the insult of denial. (Turkey claims that most Armenian victims were killed in a civil war, and that many Turks also perished at the hands of Armenians.) Yet the U.S. government has been complicit in Turkey's defiance, thanks primarily to a policy of realpolitik that calls for deference to a strategic ally in an increasingly unstable region of the world. That's why American presidents have repeatedly refused to call the genocide a genocide.Although Barack Obama promised as a candidate to “recognize the Armenian genocide” if he became president, so far he (like his predecessors) has avoided using that apparently too-blunt word in annual statements condemning the “Meds Yeghern,” as it's known in Armenian. The farthest he's gone is to call the killings a “horror” while reaffirming the U.S. government's adherence “to the principle that such atrocities must always be remembered if we are to prevent them from occurring ever again.”But how can you remember if you won't acknowledge the facts? Obama has said that “a full, frank, and just acknowledgment of the facts is in all of our interests,” yet he has continued to engage in a diplomatic dance out of misdirected fidelity to an ally.It's true that the U.S.-Turkey relationship is a very important one, and one worth nurturing and protecting, but not at the expense of denying history.Strategically, Turkey needs U.S. support — and weapons — as much as the United States needs a presence in the region (including its Air Force base near Incirlik). This is a partnership based on mutual interests, and we would hope that it would not be imperiled by an insistence on truth.The president should take a cue from Pope Francis and include the word genocide in his annual message marking the carnage a century ago. Enduring friendships require such honesty.
In a group of children and young adults with the most intractable forms of epilepsy, a liquid form of marijuana called cannabidiol reduced seizures by more than 50% without causing the drug's usual "high," researchers said.In an open-label study that enrolled 213 people with a dozen types of severe epilepsy, researchers found that cannabidiol, which is taken by mouth, was relatively well tolerated. In all, 12 subjects, or 6%, ceased taking the drug, also known as CBD, because of side effects, which included drowsiness, tiredness, diarrhea and decreased appetite. In a open-label study, patients and researchers know what drug is being tested.Among the side effects missing from the medicinal extract of marijuana is the buzz that has made marijuana a popular recreational drug for centuries. CBD accounts for as much as 40% of the marijuana plant but does not impart a buzz.Over 12 weeks, patients who suffered from Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, which can cause lifelong seizures that lead to intellectual impairments, saw 53% and 55% reductions in seizures.Dr. Orrin Devinsky of New York University's Langone Medical Center, the senior author of the preliminary study, said it was one of the first formal studies of CBD, and a hopeful development for children with severe, debilitating seizures, who have few effective options.Devinsky, who will present his findings next week at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting, said that the early finding needs to be tested further in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies with a larger population of participants.CBD is one of at least 85 cannabinoids that have been identified in the marijuana plant and is being investigated as a treatment for a wide range of disorders of the brain, including Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. The Food and Drug Administration has granted Epidiolex, made by the British firm GWPharma, orphan drug status as a treatment for Dravet syndrome, indicating that it could be available to patients on a fast-track basis.The subjects in this preliminary study range in age from toddlers to adults, but the median age was 11. All had severe epilepsy that did not respond to other treatments.Follow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and "like" Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.
Supporters of the Peoples Democratic Party protesting the outcome of the governorship election in Imo State went on the rampage in Owerri, the state capital, on Monday.The PDP supporters, who carried placards demanding that Governor Rochas Okorocha should vacate Government House for their candidate, Emeka Ihedioha, stopped and harassed motorists on Okigwe Road.The crowd of protesters, who were joined by miscreants, also beat up some road users, including commercial tricycle operators that refused to support their cause.The police arrived at the scene of the protest when it appeared to be getting out of hands and fired teargas canisters to disperse the crowd.Meanwhile, the Director of the Rochas Okorocha Campaign, Barrister Iheukwumere Alaribe, described the protest by the PDP supporters as a demonstration of their displeasure with the Imo State branch of the Independent National Electoral Commission for failing to deliver the governorship election to the party.Copyright PUNCH.

Escribió la gran obra de la izquierda latinoamericana, un polémico tratado que según él mismo reconoció "no volvería a leer", pero que marcó un hito en la literatura política de la región.Eduardo Galeano, autor de "Las venas abiertas de América Latina" (1971), falleció este lunes a los 74 años en Montevideo a causa de un cáncer de pulmón.Escritores latinoamericanos recuerdan su figura y la influencia de esta obra."La muerte de Eduardo Galeano es una pérdida inmensa, porque lo que hizo con ‘Las venas abiertas de América Latina’ no lo ha hecho ningún escritor. Galeano recogió las miles de voces de latinoamericanos más olvidados", indicó la escritora y activista mexicana a BBC Mundo.Para Poniatowska este libro, que narra siglos de explotación económica por parte de Europa y EE.UU. en la región desde la conquista, "está absolutamente vigente. Tuvo mucha razón Hugo Chávez de regalárselo a (Barack) Obama. Pero a Galeano no le gustó mucho esa idea. Le hubiese gustado que regalara otros más recientes".Esta obra le llevó a la cúspide de la literatura política latinoamericana pero en su larga carrera como periodista, escritor y dibujante Galeano también reflexionó sobre el amor, la religión y el fútbol, una de sus grandes aficiones."Sea por temas relacionados con la vida política y social de México, o por sus aficiones como el fútbol, Eduardo Galeano siempre fue un comentarista agudo", destacó en declaraciones a BBC Mundo.En cuanto a "Las venas abiertas de América Latina", Volpi cree que "es probablemente uno de los panfletos (sin ninguna connotación peyorativa) más influyentes escrito en Latinoamérica en la segunda mitad del siglo XX. Es un libro con una vocación política de mostrar las consecuencias del imperialismo norteamericano"."A muchos jóvenes escritores y activistas políticos les abrió los ojos sobre la explotación en esta parte del continente", dijo el autor en declaraciones a BBC Mundo.Sobre la vigencia de la obra considera que "esa voluntad de mostrar lo que Estados Unidos ha hecho en América Latina a lo largo de muchas décadas no deja de ser actual, si bien desde el momento de su publicación hasta nuestros días ya hay muchos otros enfoques para explicar el atraso de América Latina en muchos sectores, y no deberíamos considerar que se basa únicamente en las consecuencias del imperialismo estadounidense".El escritor peruano recuerda, en declaraciones a BBC Mundo, que sólo vio una vez a Eduardo Galeano, cuando este "participaba como orador en la toma de mando de Evo Morales y la gente lo trataba como un Dios". "Paradójicamente, creo que ese día marcó el fin de su era", dijo.El autor peruano destacó que el objetivo de la obra de Galeano "fue inspirar a quienes buscaban un orden económico más justo en nuestro continente".Por eso, dice Roncagliolo, "cuando sus lectores empezaron a llegar al poder por elecciones y no mediante la violencia, su labor quedó terminada".En la actualidad, "resulta difícil entender su mensaje porque los que defienden a Galeano en Venezuela son precisamente los que encarcelan a sus opositores", opinó.Para Roncagliolo, "la América Latina del siglo XXI no es la de Chávez y Maduro. Es la de Lula y Mujica, la de Bachelet, y la de muchos demócratas que creen que es posible combinar la justicia con la libertad y la prosperidad. Y ellos también lo leyeron"."Indiscutiblemente es un autor extraordinariamente leído, que supo conectar con un público muy amplio y desarrolló una especial capacidad para adentrarse en problemas de la historia de América Latina y de hacerlos literarios desde un punto de vista vivo, que emocionaran al lector contemporáneo. Encontró esa fórmula eficaz para hacer presente la muy lastimada historia del continente", opinó el autor mexicano.Si bien reconoce que América Latina "ha cambiado mucho", señala que "Las venas abiertas de América Latina" es una obra "abierta y deliberadamente militante, pero la realidad es más compleja que la obra", dijo en declaraciones a BBC Mundo."Es un libro escrito muy al calor de la indignación. Es un acto de coraje, y creo que la temperatura emocional del libro vive todavía. La realidad de América Latina sigue siendo injusta y violenta, pero debe ser analizada con mucho cuidado, con un acercamiento racional", asegura.De Galeano, al que dijo que tuvo "la fortuna" de conocer personalmente, recuerda que "aunque su literatura fue extraordinariamente adolorida, su pacto con la vida fue una lección de optimismo en el futuro y de vitalidad".Salgado, de 71 años y reconocido internacionalmente por sus retratos impactantes sobre la miseria y el sufrimiento humano, recuerda en entrevista con BBC Mundo desde su oficina de París que "Eduardo era muy curioso, adoraba escuchar historias".Para Salgado el legado de Galeano es que "deja una tercera opción en la literatura, un punto de vista crítico y esclarecido, con posturas claras en toda su vida".Lea también: Galeano, el hombre que "adoraba escuchar historias"Su contribución fue muy grande en ese sentido, un punto de vista muy avisado, muy fuerte. El punto más importante fue la claridad ideológica de Eduardo, que apareció en su literatura".En cuanto a la vigencia "Las venas abiertas de América Latina", el fotógrafo considera que aunque haya sido escrita en otra época, "la historia a la que se refiere es la historia de siempre"."Si hubo un pensador muy influyente en la tradición de izquierda latinoamericana, ese fue Galeano", afirmó el historiador mexicano, quien destacó también sus libros sobre el deporte y, en particular, sobre fútbol. "Con las grandes, grandes, grandes diferencias que tuve con su obra política, quiero decir que murió un escritor muy importante, y lo que hay que hacer es honrarlo", dijo a BBC Mundo.Lea también: Eduardo Galeano: "A la basura dos siglos de conquistas""Hay que decir que al final de sus días tuvo el gran valor de la autocrítica. Autocriticó su obra, el libro que lo había hecho famoso ("Las venas abiertas de América Latina")" afirmó el autor quien recordó que incluso el propio escritor uruguayo pensaba que su obra había perdido vigencia.
OTTAWA — Ontario Court Judge Charles Vaillancourt has to answer the tough legal questions here at the trial of Mike Duffy: Did the suspended P.E.I. senator commit fraud, breach of trust and bribery? Is he innocent or guilty? Do the loose-y-goose-y rules, accounting practices and administrative deference that was in the air at the Red Chamber get him off the hook or not?But on Day 5 of the trial, a broader question out of the judge’s purview is arising, document by document, question by question, and it’s this: Did Duffy ever pay for anything — just one thing — out of his own pocket?Monday, as the trial slowed to the stifling bureaucratic speed that is the norm in this city, prosecutor Jason Neubauer took a Senate human resources officer, Sonia Makhlouf, through some of the service contracts Duffy had signed out of his then-$150,000 “research and office” budget.Chief among these were 12 cheques totalling about $64,000 over the four years 2008-2012 to two companies run by Gerald Donohue, a Duffy friend who will testify this week.In his opening statement last week, prosecutor Mark Holmes alleged this money acted as “a reserve pool of funds” that allowed Duffy to “opt out of financial oversight” and was “completely outside the established system.”Among the cheques cut by Donohue’s companies, Maple Ridge Media Inc. and Ottawa ICF (Insulating Concrete Forms), were those for a makeup artist and, the judge heard Monday, framing for a whole series of photographs, mostly of Duffy with various others.The total bill, which remarkably included an invoice for $2, was about $1,500 — for enlargements or framing of photographs, as Donohue described them, of “Mike and lady” or “Mike and Man,” “Lady, Man and Child,” “Mike and Wife,” “Mike with Women and Soldier,” etc., etc.Presumably at Duffy’s behest, Donohue, who allegedly told the RCMP he wrote no speeches for Duffy despite what his contracts said, also had pictures of Barbara Bush and others mounted, and numerous enlargements made of a photograph of Duffy’s daughter and grandson.As the witness Makhlouf said, when Neubauer asked her if she would approve payment for such pictures, “No. This is not the type of service, in general, that we approve.”Asked particularly about the “lady, man and child” photograph, she seemed flabbergasted: “To be honest, I never received a request of this nature, to the best of my memory.”Meantime, Duffy’s staff was diligently tracking down occasional receipts that had — oh, the horror — somehow been billed to the senator himself.One hotel bill for a staffer, for instance, had mistakenly, an assistant wrote, been put “under the senator’s personal (this was underlined) credit card.”Duffy’s executive assistant, Melanie Vos, wrote the finance section on April 24, 2009, about “two taxi charges for which I don’t have receipts for” on Duffy’s American Express bill.One, she explained, “is related to a taxi ride to Kanata (where Duffy lives) from the Senate after the senator attended a function held by the Speaker of the Senate … The Senator left his vehicle on the Hill and felt it was best to take a taxi home as he had drank a few glasses of wine.Still, perhaps the most outlandish dinging of the taxpayers was for a $1,000 annual subscription to a prestigious online research product called Atlantic Matters that it appears Duffy never looked at or even opened.Produced by MQO Research, Atlantic Matters surveys 1,400 Atlantic Canadians — including 200 Prince Edward Islanders — every month and brags it offers a window into the “most up-to-date thinking” of Maritimers.For a senator who was born in P.E.I. but spent the majority of his adult life in Ottawa, where he’d worked for decades as a broadcaster, it would have been a useful way to keep on top of the issues consuming those he purportedly represented.Yet as MQO vice-president Elizabeth Brouse wrote the RCMP, “I was able to track users to the service and do recall that Senator Duffy never logged onto the site.”Duffy, according to that memo, had agreed to join a group of senators headed by Percy Mockler of New Brunswick in subscribing to the service.The senators, Brouse told the police, agreed to split the cost.She said she spoke to Duffy shortly after the invoice went out in February 2012.When it hadn’t been paid five months later, she “tactfully reminded” him of their earlier contact and said “he will pay his share.”The bill for $1,054.66 was paid Aug. 10 through Ottawa ICF.It was perfect, really: Mike Duffy had a concrete forms company, which purported to provide him with “editorial services and writing services,” use public money to pay for a probably useful research product he never bothered to open.
April 14 (BusinessDesk) - The government will pump an extra $20 million a year into the research and development Growth Grants programme, one of three types of grant administered by its innovation agency, Callaghan Innovation as part of the May 21 Budget.Prime Minister John Key announced the increase along with a commitment to build four new state schools, three new Maori language immersion kura kaupapa schools, and an extra 241 classrooms, mainly to cope with roll growth in Auckland, in a package of new education spending of 244 million over the next four years."Smart, innovative exporters are the key to a prosperous future for New Zealand," Key told a Business New Zealand lunch event in Wellington where he unveiled the first of the traditional drip-feed of Budget announcements prior to its official release by Finance Minister Bill English."The really important challenge we have is to increase private sector investment in research and development, where New Zealand continues to lag behind some of the world's leading economies."The Growth Grants scheme meets 20 percent of a firm's research and development budget, provided the company commits $300,000 and at least 1.5 percent of turnover to research and development activity, capped at $5 million a year and available for two years in the first instance, with review that can see a further three years' funding potentially available.The $80 million additional commitment over the next four years, announced today, is on top of $566 million of co-funding for research and development by private companies."This funding is equivalent to a 14 percent increase in Callaghan Innovation's R&D co-funding budget and will get us closer to our overall target," said Key.
The burst of wild and warm weather expected early Monday night was a bit of a bust.Environment Canada warned of a "sharp and fast moving cold front" which could bring thunderstorms to the area.Wind gusts of 80 to 85 km/h are possible in some areas, with 90 km/h gusts "not completely out of the question," the weather agency said.At that speed, strong enough to cause tree damage and power outages.The forecast called for high winds and a 90 per cent change of precipitation beginning about 5 p.m. What arrived was a mix of showers, sunshine (sometimes together), and moderate winds.The alert followed a beautiful spring day Sunday with a high of 17.2. Hamilton also hit a high of 24 at 3 p.m. Monday afternoon at the airport. That's still a bit off the record of 26.1 we had in 1977.The unsettled weather was likely a blip, however, with Tuesday expected to be sunny with a high of about 14.
A year ago, lawyers working on both sides of convicted killer Michael Rafferty’s appeal were told to set a timetable for sharing information, under a judge’s urging they move quickly.“It is in the public interest and the interest of justice that this appeal proceed to hearing as soon as possible,” Ontario Court of Appeal Justice Marc Rosenberg wrote.But a year later, there are no documents filed with the court and no dates set for hearings, the court confirmed Monday.For some family members of victim Victoria (Tori) Stafford, the long, silent wait with no sign of a legal resolution means they can’t put the case, or their fears, to rest.“For the last year and a half, two years, we’ve been in limbo, waiting to figure out what he (Rafferty) is doing,” said Tori’s father, Rodney Stafford. “We can’t set anything to rest because we are too concerned about what’s coming up. It’s disgusting.”Eight-year-old Tori was kidnapped April 8, 2009, while walking home from her school in Woodstock and killed that same evening in a wooded area of a farm north of Guelph.Rafferty was convicted May 11, 2012, of first-degree murder, kidnapping and sexual assault causing bodily harm and sentenced to life in prison.His partner in the killing, Terri-Lynne McClintic, pleaded guilty April 30, 2010, to first-degree murder and was sentenced to life in prison.Rafferty received leave to appeal in November 2012, but his attempt became mired for more than a year in arguments over who would pay for his lawyer and what level of legal representation he would receive.In December 2013, Ontario’s court of appeal ruled the province should pay for a lawyer because of the complexities of the case and merits of the appeal.Rosenberg took on the responsibility of managing the appeal and set a date of May 2014 for counsel to arrange a timetable for filing factums —the main arguments — and the appeal book, the collection of all the supporting documents. It’s not clear if the timetable itself was filed and what, if any deadlines, it contains.Criminal cases take on average 14 months to go from the time leave to appeal is granted to the time the appeal is ready for a court date, according to the Ontario Court of Appeal’s annual reports.Whatever date is chosen in Rafferty’s case, either the November 2012 leave to appeal or December 2013 ruling granting him a lawyer, his case has already surpassed the average timeframe.But Rafferty’s appeal lawyer, Paul Calarco, said the length of time for a murder case is not unusual.“A case of this size can take a significant amount of time before it appears before the court.”Calarco said he could provide few details because of client confidentiality.“I can say that I am continuing to work on the appeal. No dates have been set for it. That is quite common,” he said. “There are a number of steps that have to be taken.”Tori’s mother, Tara McDonald, said she tries not to think about the outstanding court case until something happens.“He’s just using every last straw of the legal system that he possibly can,” she said. “We have given them both too much of our lives already. Their names aren’t spoken in our homes, and we no longer allow them any more of our thoughts.”But her ex-husband Stafford said it’s difficult to put the two convicted killers aside when the family receives regular updates about their movements.“Especially McClintic. She is being taken out (of prison) all the time for whatever, probably toothaches and crap.”The notices, which come every couple of months or so, induce mixed feelings, he said.“It’s kind of good to know what they’re up to,” Stafford said.But, “It’s upsetting because here I am busting my ass daily,” added Stafford, who works for a commercial cleaning company, “and I don’t have (medical) coverage. Everything I’m working for is helping keep them alive and well.”
Though he’s been out of the Montreal lineup since the incident against the Panthers — which left him visibly groggy — the Canadiens will not confirm if Pacioretty is recovering from a concussion. This only seemed to drive speculation ahead of the Canadiens’ first playoff series — which begins Wednesday at home against the National Hockey League’s hottest team, the Ottawa Senators.At the centre of the latest miniature controversy is the fact that he wore a tinted visor during practice.Pacioretty could be using the visor to shield his eyes from the bright playing surface, which might indicate he’s recovering from a head injury. But if he has any sort of an aversion to light, you wouldn’t have known it in the Habs’ dressing room. The forward was mobbed by nearly a dozen television cameras — each equipped with bright lights — and he didn’t exactly recoil behind a pair of sunglasses.“I’m just trying to look a little more flashy out there … it was to look cool, to fit in, maybe I’m trying a little too hard,” he said of the visor.Speaking only in vague terms about his injury, Pacioretty said doctors haven’t yet cleared him for contact and that he’s “responding to treatment,” whatever that means.“I think at this point of the year, I have an obligation to say that I have an upper-body injury,” Pacioretty said when asked if he suffered a concussion. “You don’t want to give anybody a competitive edge by spelling out what it really is. … I’m following the plan, we’ve had a plan since Day 1, but right now we’re right on schedule. … I won’t come back unless I’m 100 per cent (healthy).”The Canadiens have one of the NHL’s least potent offences heading into the playoffs and losing Pacioretty, their leading scorer, won’t help matters as they prepare to face goalie Andrew Hammond — who won 20 of his 24 games for the Senators.There’s no definitive evidence that Pacioretty has a brain injury, but recent cases have shown flaws in the National Hockey League’s concussion protocol — which was revised before the 2013-14 regular season. During last year’s playoffs, Columbus Blue Jackets defenceman James Wisniewski told reporters he lied to doctors about experiencing concussion symptoms in order to stay in the game.“My head didn’t feel great … (but) I said my back hurt, so I didn’t have to do the 20-minute (concussion) protocol and go through that whole concussion process,” he said. “I didn’t feel like going in and talking to the doctors for 20 minutes.”During the Canadiens’ 2014 playoff run, former Habs defenceman Josh Gorges said there’s a natural tendency for players to throw caution to the wind and just want to get back in the game.“It’s such a tricky injury because, as a doctor, you can’t read a player’s mind,” Gorges said. “You don’t know what’s going on inside his brain. And as a player, how do you really know if you have a concussion?”But again, there’s no confirmation that Pacioretty has a head injury. He’s been concussed before and, we’re told, the team will not rush him back into play if he isn’t ready. Still, without anything more substantive than “upper body injury” to go on, there is only idle speculation.
CORALVILLE, Iowa -- Hillary Rodham Clinton's excellent road trip adventure continued Monday, as she drove to Iowa for the first scheduled campaign events of her new presidential bid.Clinton is riding in an armored black van she uses when in New York and which she has nicknamed "Scooby," because it reminds her of the van in the "Scooby Doo" television cartoon.Clinton left her Chappaqua, N.Y., home shortly after her campaign announcement Sunday and spent the night in Pittsburgh, where she ordered room service for dinner, an aide said.On Monday her small contingent of aides and Secret Service agents ate lunch at a Chipotle near Toledo -- where the staff reportedly failed to recognize her -- and later stopped in Joliet, Ill. She ate some healthy snacks along the way, including cottage cheese and almonds, her office said.Clinton is using the time in the van to make phone calls, the aide said. Her call list is sure to include donors and potential political supporters as she launched her second attempt at the White House -- as well as perhaps to check in on her husband, Bill, and granddaughter, Charlotte."She first raised the idea of driving to Iowa a few weeks ago as a way to get out on the road, enjoy a last few days of being able to have no set schedule and being able to meet people," the aide said."Last fall when she was campaigning for [New Hampshire Democrats], bad weather delayed her flight by several hours so she ended up driving and really enjoyed it."
Opus Wins Further Rail Work in the UKInfrastructure consultancy, Opus International Consultants (Opus), has recently been awarded £3.5m in long-term rail contracts in the UK.The UK contract wins further strengthen Opus’ rail portfolio, adding bridge design commissions to strategic asset management, geotechnical investigation, and buildings asset support with Network Rail.Opus’ performance in the UK had been impacted by the GFC over the past few years but prudent business decisions and increased economic certainty has seen it recover well. In 2014 the business had its best performance ever with revenue up 26%.“Two years ago we set a strategy which focussed on rail as a growth area and we are delighted that this is now bearing fruit. These appointments recognise our global expertise in transport asset management and design and show that we continue to deliver on Network Rail’s vision of providing a safer, more reliable and efficient railway,” says Dr David Prentice, Opus Chief Executive.According to Network Rail, more people travel by rail today than at any point since the 1920s, when the rail network was around twice its current size. It is estimated that over the next 30 years, passenger demand for rail will more than double, and freight demand is expected to go up by 140%.And it’s not just the UK that is seeing an increased demand for rail. Opus is also targeting a number of rail transportation projects in Australia through its specialist rail business which provides services to the public and freight transport sectors.“During the past 12 months we have gained significant ground and enhanced our reputation in this key market. We are now ranked in the top 20 consultants providing services to the rail sector in the UK and we are working on some of the most prestigious rail projects in Australia. This is a fantastic achievement for all of our staff and makes us an even more attractive employer for new talent,” adds Dr Prentice.The contract awards have led to an increase in rail engineer recruitment throughout the UK for Opus.
Private firms are profiting from extortionate hospital parking fees paid by NHS patients and relatives, an investigation has revealed.The companies walk away with millions of pounds that the public has been led to believe is invested in vital treatment and care.Nearly half of hospital trusts hire private firms to run their car parks and collect fees of up to £4 an hour.Depending on local arrangements, these firms take anything from a tenth to 100 per cent of the money made each year.The disclosures will dismay patients and relatives who have always been told the money is essential to improve services and pay frontline staff.Campaigners described the charges as a ‘rip-off’ unfairly penalising cancer patients, elderly outpatients and distressed relatives.Despite calls for the fees to be abolished, the Government has always said the money is a vital source of funding for the NHS.However, Freedom of Information responses obtained by the Mail from 100 NHS trusts reveal 43 use private firms to manage their car parks.The majority refused to say how much of the money generated by the fees went to private firms, claiming it was ‘commercially sensitive’ or that the information ‘wasn’t available’.But six trusts – East Lancashire, the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen, North Cumbria, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire, Sherwood Forest and Worcestershire Acute Hospitals – confirmed private firms running their parking walked away with all the cash taken.East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust said French-based parking giant Vinci took three quarters of the £1.4million collected in fees last year.The responses show profits are going to large foreign-owned companies with contracts at several hospitals. These include: the German firm APCOA, which has contracts with four trusts; Vinci, used by three trusts; and the Dutch Q Park, also contracted by three trusts.Last night, Macmillan Cancer Support’s Duleep Allirajah said: ‘It is of great concern that many cancer patients in England are still paying extortionate hospital car parking charges in order to access treatment for a life-threatening illness.'What’s more, many private firms may be benefiting… this is unacceptable.‘Cancer patients receiving vital treatments… will often need to make frequent trips to hospital yet unaffordable charges are leaving many out of pocket.’Katherine Murphy, of the Patients Association, said if the money was ‘reinvested in frontline care it could pay for much needed nurses’. She added: ‘The NHS is meant to be open and transparent but nobody knows where this money is actually going.’Jonathan Isaby, of the Taxpayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Patients will be livid that they’ve been hoodwinked into thinking their money is going into frontline healthcare when that is clearly not the case.‘Patients and their families should be told the truth about where their money is going… these charges can really add up if an individual is in hospital for a long period of time.’The investigation found the 100 NHS trusts collected a total of £103.6million in parking charges in 2012/13 – the latest figures available.There are 160 trusts in England. Based on the average from 100 responses, they collected £165million overall. It is not known how much of this went to private firms but the figure is likely to be tens of millions.Last summer Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt issued guidance to hospitals telling them to offer reduced rates of parking to the most seriously ill patients or their relatives.But many limit this to patients who are dying and demand they pay the fees upfront – often meaning relatives must later go through the bureaucracy of being reimbursed.In Scotland, the charges were abolished in 2008 and they exist in only two of the seven health boards in Wales.Shortly before the 2010 election, former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham promised to scrap the charges.But the Tories later said the policy would be unworkable and accused Labour of ‘cynically’ announcing it to win votes.Research by charity Macmillan has found parking charges cause stress and anxiety for 45 per cent of cancer patients.An investigation by the Mail last year revealed how vulnerable patients were being targeted by cowboy parking wardens.
As the noisy students set off marching under a blazing afternoon sun, the man said in French: “It’s like the 1970s again.”The woman next to him smiled and clapped as the students passed by chanting anti-austerity slogans. “They’re so young,” she remarked.Perhaps this spring’s student protest movement brought back memories of headier political times in Quebec, when the Quiet Revolution began to get noisier.But then as now, one can argue if youthful idealism actually won the day.A Léger-Le Devoir survey taken a week ago shows that two thirds of Quebecers are opposed to the student strike/boycott. However, 47 per cent of those age 18 to 24 support the protests.And splits are showing at Université du Québec à Montréal, scene of last week’s turmoil and vandalism that led to the arrest of dozens of students.While the protesters enjoy the support of some staff, the head of UQAM’s board of directors, Lise Bissonnette, is publicly supporting rector Robert Proulx’s decision to call in the police last week after masked protesters disrupted classes using intimidation tactics.Bissonnette has written an open letter to the university community expressing her support for Proulx’s actions.Bissonnette said she was absolutely “astonished” that the intervention of police on campus has been described and criticized as having violated the sanctuary of the university.It was not the police intervention that was a violation, she said, but rather the organized gangs declaring that teaching was out of order, a situation she found “incomprehensible.”“That is why I fully support the decisions taken by the rector of UQAM,” she wrote in the letter. “It was surreal the night and day after the rampage that occurred on April 8, to hear people … formally demanding his resignation because his response to the mayhem should, in their view, be amnesty without regard to the existing frameworks of life at UQAM.”While the fault lines are showing at UQAM, the battle lines were clearly drawn again on Monday when a Quebec Superior Court judge extended an injunction prohibiting anyone from disrupting classes at UQAM. The injunction, which expired Monday, has been extended to July 21.However, that didn’t prevent about a dozen people, some wearing masks, from disturbing a class in the reopened J.-A.-DeSève building around noon Monday.There were no arrests during Monday’s march, which wound its way through the streets of Plateau-Mont-Royal and ended at UQAM.Police did use pepper spray on a protester who reversed direction on St-Denis St. and tried to breach police lines at the rear, but that was an isolated incident.The march ended peacefully as students dispersed shortly after staging a brief sit-down on Berri St. in front of UQAM.A couple of students from CEGEP St-Laurent who took part in the march said last week’s violence at UQAM deterred more students from joining the protest.Both were adamant that the violence was more the result of police strong-arm tactics than student vandalism.“We’re protesting against austerity and the expulsion of students at UQAM last week,” said a 19-year-old student who did not want to give her name.Karen Seidman of the Montreal Gazette contributed to this story.
Canada’s most beloved trailer park boy is throwing his support behind the residents of Calgary’s Midfield Mobile Home Park.Bubbles, a bespectacled character on the hit Canadian comedy series Trailer Park Boys, tweeted to his 151,000 followers on Monday urging Calgary’s Mayor Naheed Nenshi to “Pls (sic) stop destroying homes and lives in Midfield Park.”“Trailer parks need to look out for one another!” Bubbles wrote.Monday’s tweet follows an April 10 tweet from Bubbles’ account that urged fans to “save our trailer park in Calgary” and sign a petition that Midfield homeowners have been circulating for several months.Last May, in the midst of a housing crisis, the city announced that Midfield — a city-owned mobile park — was slated to close in 2017 because of its aging infrastructure.The announcement followed more than a decade of controversy and uncertainty over the inner-city mobile community’s future.When the park’s residents were abruptly told of the impending closure, they were also informed that city council would not be relocating citizens of the 16th Avenue N.E. mobile home park to the city’s outskirts, a plan previously discussed with tenants.MacDonald said the celebrity boost from Bubbles’ Twitter account came after she asked the actor on Twitter if he would help share the park’s petition.“It was shocking, amazing that he even replied. He’s a celebrity, he’s busy,” she said.MacDonald said people from across the world have signed the petition following Bubbles’ initial tweet about Midfield, and when the character tweeted the city’s mayor on Monday, MacDonald cried.“We’ve been ignored. We still run into people in Calgary that don’t even know what’s happening here,” she said.While residents have long been keen to squash trailer park stereotypes, MacDonald welcomed the Trailer Park Boys endorsement because it’s helping spread the word about what’s happening at Midfield.“We don’t want to be seen like Trailer Park Boys, but we’re already thought of as trailer trash,” she said.Residents have previously told the Herald they could be homeless when the park closes, while the city stands to make millions if the land is sold.“I’m glad that the Trailer Park Boys are speaking up,” he said.
A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress in Delta State, Dr. Alex Ideh, has expressed concerns over the drove of defection into the party, following its victory at the March 28 presidential poll.Ideh said he was worried that if not regulated, the mass defection into the party might lead to incursion of certain elements he described as political entrepreneurs, whom he said, would undermine the harmony in the party.The APC chieftain reportedly expressed this worry on Friday during a meeting with some APC leaders who visited him in his Warri home, in the buildup to Saturday’s governorship and House of Assembly polls.Though he said the party’s doors remained opened to politicians from rival parties, Ideh, however, reiterated that the APC must get commitment from the intending defectors that they would abide by the party’s existing dictates, rules and regulations towards “cohesion in the corporate interest of the party and the advancement of democracy in Nigeria.”Assuring Nigerians that the incoming Muhammadu Buhari-led APC government would deliver on all its campaign promises, Ideh, implored Nigerians to be ready to exercise patience with the incoming administration.“The jobs to be done are enormous. Nigerians should relax, be patient and pray for the incoming administration and in particular, for General Buhari, who needs God’s wisdom and people’s co-operation to deliver on his promises.“High expectations of the Nigerian people is understandable because of maladministration of the PDP in the last 16 years but the anxiety involved is needless as the President-elect and the APC can be trusted to select a formidable team to navigate the ship of this great country to berth at a glorious shore,” he said.Copyright PUNCH.

PORTO (PORTUGAL) - Injury-hit Bayern Munich head to Porto for Wednesday's Champions League quarter-final, first leg minus a host of stars, but determined to boost their bid to reach a fourth straight European semi-final.Pep Guardiola's Bayern last failed to reach the last four in Europe in 2011 and having lifted the European title five times, the 2013 Champions League winners have won 16 of their 25 matches at this stage.But rarely have the star-studded Bavarian giants been so hamstrung by injuries.Left-back David Alaba, centre-back Medhi Benatia, midfielder Javi Martinez and right winger Arjen Robben are all missing.To compound matters, left winger Franck Ribery and defensive midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger were ruled out on Monday with an ankle injury and 'flu respectively.Bayern have Spain veteran Xabi Alonso back after serving a one-match ban, while Germany defender Jerome Boateng and striker Claudio Pizarro are back after injury.Even missing their top stars, Bayern still managed to dominate Eintracht Frankfurt in Saturday's 3-0 league win at Munich's Allianz Arena to keep them ten points clear in the Bundesliga.Robert Lewandowski scored twice to leave him with nine goals in his last eight league games and has taken over from Robben as the club's top scorer in all competitions.Guardiola has said there is no point Bayern ruing their misfortune while director of sport Matthias Sammer said the Germans' title hunger will carry them through as they chase the treble of European, cup and league titles."There is a chance that this small, but high-quality group can develop a lot of strength and dynamic," said Sammer."It's well known that this team is hungry."Bayern have won six of their last ten Champions League away matches including their 7-1 win at AS Roma in the group stage.Even shorn of fleet-footed wingers Robben and Ribery, plus midfield general Schweinsteiger, Bayern can still name five World Cup winners at the Estadio do Dragao."We know that we can rely on whichever team plays," confirmed Thomas Mueller."It'll be a close match, I assume we won't win 5-0, but we must make sure we come home with a good result."Their punishing schedule of a game every three or four days is being seen as a positive in the Bayern camp."It's nothing to do with the team's substance, it's the most beautiful rhythm in the world," said Sammer."The players would rather play games than train."Hosts FC Porto have their own share of injury woes with Colombia striker Jackson Martinez doubtful with a groin injury after scoring 26 goals in all competitions.Likewise, forward Christian Tello is missing having torn his right thigh before Porto's heavy league defeat to Estoril on April 6.Their 3-1 win at Rio Ave on Saturday left Porto second in Portugal's top flight, three points behind leaders Benfica, as Ricardo Quaresma, Real Madrid-bound right-back Danilo and forward Hernani all netted.Porto are seeking a first semi-final appearance since the 2004 run to the final when they won the Champions League under Jose Mourinho."Playing the quarter-finals of a competition as big as this one is a reward for everyone and the only thing on our mind is dreams and ambitions", said Porto's Spanish coach Julen Lopetegui, a former team-mate of Guardiola at Barcelona."There is nothing else to take into the game."The Portuguese club's last quarter-final appearance was in 2008/09 when they were knocked out by Manchester United.Their only two victories in six previous quarter-final appearances came in the seasons when they went on to be crowned European champions.
Prime Minister John Key has announced a suite of new schools which will be funded in next month's budget and a boost in research and development funding.He has also suggested that the Budget will contain measures to address child poverty, saying "we're focused on breaking the cycle of material hardship among families with children."He made his comment at a pre-Budget speech in Wellington the Business New Zealand.In last year's election campaign, National said it would meet population growth with $350 million in funding for new classrooms and schools.Today he said the four new state schools would be:- Two primary schools in Auckland - one at Kumeu and the other at Scott Point.Mr Key said the Government would also establish three new kura kaupapa Maori in Whakatane, Gisborne, and Hastings.The seven seven new schools would provide spaces for nearly 4,000 extra students and the first was expected to open in 2017.He outlined expansion plans for four existing schools:The Budget would also contain funding for an extra 241 classrooms around the country, almost half of them in New Zealand.Mr Key said the Budget would provide another $80 million over four years to encourage private sector research and development on top of the $566 million over four years in co-funding for companies undertaking research and development (R&D).The funding was equivalent to a 14 per cent increase in Callaghan Innovation's R&D co-funding budget.It would get New Zealand closer to the overall target of 1 per cent of GDP being spent on R&D.The extra $80 million would be allocated to a range of qualifying business over 12 months "on an objective independent basis."He cited two companies which had received similar grants recently: Rocket Lab, an Auckland-based aerospace company and Pultron Composites of Gisborne which was conducting R&D into resin technology and engineering.Mr Key said he sought election because he believed New Zealand had under performed as a country for many years.With consistent and sensible economic reform, New Zealand was capable of being one of the world's best performing economies again, he said."What we are seeing now are the first signs of that."I say we are just seeing the first signs of progress because a couple of good years are not enough to change our long-term well being."There was still plenty to keep economists awake at night whether it was falling global commodity prices, a fragile Europe, or a weaker outlook for Australia and China."Now is definitely not the time for New Zealand to rest on its laurels."
The Independent National Electoral Commission has declared Peoples Democratic Party candidates as the winners of 13 of the 14 results released so far in the 16 constituencies where elections held in Bayelsa State.A list of the names of winners in the election released by the Resident Electoral Commissioner, Mr. Baritor Kpagih, did not include the votes scored by the respective candidates and their political parties.When he was accosted by journalists for a comprehensive result, he referred journalists to the Public Relations Officer, Mr. Timidi Wariowei, who told journalists interested in the number of votes scored by each candidate and political party to write INEC.A look at the result released by INEC showed that the PDP won 13 out of the 14 Assembly seats released so far while the APC won one.The election was declared inconclusive in Ogbia Constituency II while elections could not hold in Brass Constituency II because the youths allegedly insisted on sighting collation results sheets before the commencement of accreditation.The PDP winners as announced by INEC are Abraham Ingobere, Brass Constituency 111; Ololo Ben, Ingo Iwowari; and Obiene Iniyobiyo.Others are Monday Obolo, Igali Barapadei, Benson Friday, for the Southern Ijaw Constituencies 1, III and IV respectively.Also, returned as winners are Salo Adikumo, Sagbama III, Dr. Parkinson Markmanuel, Ebiuwou Obiyai and Emelah Epilefa for Yenagoa constituencies 1, II and III.The only successful candidate from the opposition APC defeated the Deputy Speaker, Victor Sam-Ateki, to win the Brass I Constituency seat.Copyright PUNCH.

In the euphoric delusional celebration of the Buhari presidential victory, the political class of the APC hue may have forgotten the fundamental and deep seated problems of disunity and lack of fiscal federalism plaguing the nation. They are contended with the banal issue of the departure of the Jonathan administration promising to tackle the issues of corruption and insecurity.These are good starting points for the Buhari administration but the enduring challenge of fixing the Nigerian federation and making it work for the betterment of all Nigerians should be the long time goal and objective. To put all our energies in solving the insecurity problem and corruption, and dissemble that all is well with us is nothing short of contemplating our political and national navel.The problems of political restructuring predated the Jonathan administration and nobody can blame him for the skewed federal system of government. But Jonathan like other leaders before him cannot escape blame for lacking the initiative and political will to tackle our political structure. The last national conference was an opportunity for the Jonathan administration to correct them but he buckled under the illusions that there were sensitive areas that the members of the national conference should not address.In the political formulation of Mr President, the indivisibility of the country should not be discussed. The probing question on the lips of genuine patriots: Is the Nigerian federation working? Is the patch work of Lord Lugard and his mistress that midwife the country suitable for the offspring of this illegal union? Why are some people afraid of the division of the nation when even the United Kingdom is contemplating that under the veneerof the failed Scotland referendum for independence? The truth of the matter is that if we grope in that path of delusion, we shall continue to gallop from one problem to another. The Buhari administration must look in this direction and mint solutions to the problems.The name `Federal Republic of Nigeria` is a suspect and even a first year university student of political science knows that. That is why some people are calling for the practice of true federalism even though there is no word like that. It is like saying that one`s spouse is slightly pregnant. You are either practising federalism or not.Today our quasi federalism is veering towards unitary system of government and those who lambasted Aguiyi Ironsi for unitary system of government are the strongest advocates of that model of governance. Nobody should be afraid of the breakup of the country because it serves Nigerians better to stay together as one.But the basis of that existence must be surely worked and not the crop of our politicians especially those of the national assembly who are more armoured with the insane acquisition of money and influence. That is why the suggestion of the Senate President, David Mark about the creation of more states isthe most bizarre solution to the problem of the country and a confirmation that most of our politicians are not in touch with reality. The national assembly legislators are in the merry go round coaster roller political tour as the highest paid legislators in the world and do not bother about the welfare of the electorate.If Buhari is to leave enduring legacy, he must fashion out a bill before the national assembly that should restructure the country along the lines of fiscal federalism so that the current method of carrying bowls to Abuja by the state and local government officials is stopped for good. The fine grains of federalism should be entrenched in our system and will end the lazy option of states depending on Abuja for survival. There are many other minerals in the country outside crude oil and when the spirits of federalism are operational, this nation should be blessed with zeal of the human enterprise and the exploitation of such minerals.Furthermore, state creation should not be on the cards of the Buhari administration. The outlandish notion that state creation will bring development to the people has been blown to shreds with most states government owing their workers many months of salaries. What this country needs is transparent and honest leadership that will spread the dividends of democracy to all corners of the country and not the enrichment of the political class with the creation of idle fat cats and toads of war. There is too much money in the political system that even an aide to the aide of a state governor or council chairman is an instant millionaire. These are the leakages that should be blocked. Leadership should not be about primitive accumulation of wealth rather it should be about service to the people and making the country better than one met it.As for the unity of the country, we should copy the model of the American dream. The kernel of the American dream is anchored on justice, equity and fairness. You can come from any part of the globe, the moment the American government discovers that you have something to offer, you are quickly assimilated into the system. That should be the priority of our leaders. Unfortunately our leaders exploit our tribal differences for their political gains and use them to climb the political ladder.One should not be ashamed of one`s roots but the greater interest of the nation should take priority over primordial sentiments. The Buhari administration in the space of less than fifty days must put on its thinking cap and mint out ideas of forging a united Nigeria. The various fault lines and cracks in nation building must be looked into and the best political engineering method fashioned out to build a truly national edifice.I do not envy those that will take over the affairs of the nation after the departure of the Jonathan team. The work is herculean and is not going to be a pleasure ride. Should Buhari and his team focus only on the mundane issues of insecurity and corruption, then the whole idea of change mantra will turn out to be a lousy housewife weekend romance to lure us away from the difficult realities of our situation.The Nigerian nation is a contraption and is not working and what the mass of the people demand from Buhari is to make the system work for all Nigerians by tackling the fundamental ills that assault the happiness and welfare of the people. This is the challenge before the Buhari administration and should it fail, the honey moon shall not last.

The 100-page bill would implement many measures of the Couillard government’s June budget intended to balance the province’s books. It would also increase the price of a spot in public daycares by pegging the fee to household income.Radio-Canada cited anonymous sources saying the government would call a special sitting of the National Assembly on Friday and use the parliamentary procedure to overcome obstruction.For each month the government waits to adopt the bill, the provincial treasury loses $33 million in potential revenue, Premier Philippe Couillard told reporters Monday.Two weeks ago, Finance Minister Carlos Leitão’s patience for the debate on Bill 28 was already wearing thin.“After four months, we started only yesterday the detailed analysis line by line and we have done seven articles. There are 300-and-something articles in this legislation, so we need to pick up the pace,” he said.This would be the second time the Couillard government has resorted to invoking closure. In February, it used the parliamentary procedure to force Bill 10, the administrative health-care reform, through the National Assembly.
Two Papamoa schools are in line to expand their facilities and classrooms after gaining a slice of a $244 million pre budget promise.In a pre-budget speech today, Prime Minister John Key announced that Golden Sands School and Papamoa College are part of the nationwide multi-million dollar investment on new schools and classrooms.Papamoa College is in line for a large cash injection.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio has urged Americans to look to the future as he launched his 2016 White House campaign.Speaking at a rally in Miami, he said the presidential election was "a generational choice" and warned against going back to "the leaders and ideas of the past".
The Group Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, First City Monument Bank Limited, Mr. Ladi Balogun, spoke with SIMON EJEMBI on the declining value of the naira and the fortunes of Nigerian banks.Economists have described the last two years as very challenging for the financial sector with a ratings agency, Fitch, predicting the profits of Nigerian banks will decline this year. Do you think the banks can overcome the challenges in the short term?Last year, many predicted the profits of banks would decline, yet we saw the opposite. No doubt, 2015 will be a tough year. There are strong reasons to be cautiously optimistic, while building buffers for any negative outcome. The successful presidential election has already eliminated one of the dark clouds that hung over the country. I am more confident now that we have the ability to navigate the troubled waters successfully as a nation.As an industry, I believe earnings will still be up this year when compared to 2014. The first quarter of 2015 was tough for most banks mainly due to the electoral jitters. I believe we will see things picking up in subsequent quarters, especially if, as anticipated, oil prices firm up. In the short term, however, cost management and risk management will be essential for growth in profits within the financial sector. This is also where you will find most banks focusing on. In the second half of the year, and as the new government settles in, I expect revenue and earnings to begin to improve.How has the declining value of the naira affected Nigerian banks, especially those that have accessed foreign loans and issued euro bonds?Nigerian banks that took foreign loans and Eurobonds have largely used these funds to finance loans to companies that generate foreign currency revenue or who took foreign currency denominated loans. Hence, we do not see an imminent currency risk from these activities. To the contrary, foreign currency loans are increasingly critical at this time that we have pressure on our reserves, which I believe we will overcome. We are also curtailing naira liquidity to fight inflation. As a matter of fact, they have provided a good hedge for bank shareholders against the risk of devaluation on their investments. What we must continue to do is avoid a mismatch of lending dollars to those who have naira revenues.Do you think the closure of the RDAS by the central bank, which is considered a form of devaluation of the naira, and other decisions with regard to foreign exchange can help stabilise the naira?The closure of the RDAS was the right move by the regulators. We need to move towards the harmonisation of our different forex markets in order to avoid round tripping and to boost liquidity. Multiple markets are less liquid than a single consolidated market. Liquidity is necessary if we are to remain in the various bond indexes that attract foreign portfolio investment. This is also important if we are to attract foreign investors into our equity markets. The central bank has done a good job in stabilising the naira in the official market. We have also seen appreciation post-election on the parallel market. As the uncertainty disappears and investors’ estimation of the naira’s fair value moves closer to its actual value, we will see portfolio investors flood in. This is because the fundamentals of the country remain strong despite the drop in oil prices.Analysts have projected that the exposure of Nigerian banks to the oil and gas sector, which has been hit by the slump in oil prices, could lead to a surge in their non-performing loans this year. What is the situation with the FCMB and how best do you think the situation can be handled?The FCMB has about 20 per cent of its loan book in oil and gas. And 40 per cent of that is in the downstream (marketing of refined products) and the remaining 60 per cent in the upstream. Downstream actually fares better when oil prices fall, hence that portion of the book is unaffected. A significant portion of our upstream portfolio is hedged internationally; so, it is also not affected by oil price shocks. The portion, which accounts for less than eight per cent of our loan book, is performing well as the borrowers have significant equity in their transactions. Our philosophy was and remains that we seek to hedge against oil prices and where we cannot, we ask for very significant equity cushion. Hence, we do not anticipate deterioration in our oil and gas loan portfolio.The FCMB’s results for the 2014 financial year showed a 38 per cent and 32 per cent growth in profit before tax and profit after tax, respectively, despite the economic challenges. What drove the performance?There were two fundamental factors at play. The first was the continued growth of our retail business. We are one of the most prolific relations lenders in the country and have been able to sustain this with very low level of loan losses. This has given us some of the healthiest margins in the industry. The second was our dollar loan book, which accounted for 40 per cent of the total loans and it rose in value as the naira devalued.In 2015, we expect the retail loans and dollar lending to remain the key drivers. In addition, our cards and electronic banking activities are gaining momentum and will help to drive strong annuity fee income as well as build our current account balances. Our business is a diversified one and this is serving us well in the tough times.The real sector continues to struggle due to low access to funds. In 2014, you recorded significant increases in loans to customers. Do you have plans to better that this year?Yes, in 2014, we gave out over 250,000 loans. This was done within tolerable risk limits. Most of our non-performing loans came from names in the larger commercial space. Accordingly, inclusive lending has proved to be a value creator for us. In 2015, we will continue with this momentum and we will be expanding our activities in agriculture and other niches that are currently under-banked. Hence, we expect more borrowers to benefit from the FCMB’s supportive strategy.With several banks seeking additional capital due to regulatory changes and prevailing economic challenges, do you think the bank’s decision to pay a dividend of 25k is right?Our 25 kobo dividend was fairly conservative as we only paid out about 30 per cent of our profits for the year. We also have a strong capital adequacy ratio in excess of 20 per cent at the group level. Accordingly, we have the capacity to not only pay this dividend but also support our growth in what might be perceived as a riskier operating environment.What are your projections for this year?Generally, 2015 will be a year of two halves. The first half will be tough. We may be flat or even slightly down compared to last year. This is because of the challenges experienced in the foreign exchange markets in the first quarter and the uncertainty around the presidential election, which has now passed. We expect as the second quarter comes to an end that economic activities will recover and liquidity will return to the foreign exchange markets. Should this happen, the second half of the year could be very strong and thereby leading to an overall better year in 2015. This is because the fundamentals, underpinned by a profitable and rapidly growing retail business, remain strong, irrespective of the challenging macroeconomic environment.Several investors dumped bank stocks in the last 13 months leading to a decline in virtually all banking stocks; do you think the situation will improve based on the 2014 results released by banks so far?We are already seeing renewed interest in bank stocks. The FCMB stock has risen by over 30 per cent this year as have those of many other banks. This was based on strong financial result announcements and the euphoria that followed a peaceful election. We must however acknowledge that until foreign portfolio investors return on significant volume, the performance of bank stocks and, in fact that of all stocks, will be a bit subdued. However, I believe as the macro environment becomes more stable, Nigeria will resume its position as the most compelling stock market opportunity in sub Saharan Africa. The FCMB Group will remain a major conduit of portfolio investment into the stock market.

A nurse accused of murdering three patients in a hospital poisoning spree warned there was ‘a devil’ in him, a jury heard yesterday.Victorino Chua penned what he called a ‘bitter nurse confession’ in which he spelled out ‘how an angel can turn to an evil person’.In 13 pages of rambling, broken handwritten English, the Filipino nurse said he might ‘explode’ at any time, adding: ‘If I will be pushed, they gonna be sorry.’Chua is accused of killing three patients by contaminating their saline drips with insulin and deliberately poisoning 18 others at Stepping Hill Hospital in Stockport between 2011 and 2012.His lawyers say the document – found in his home following his arrest – is not a criminal confession but an ‘outlet for his anger and frustration’ written at the suggestion of a counsellor 12 months before the first alleged poisoning.But questioned by detectives after his arrest for changing patients’ prescriptions on the wards, the 49-year-old said: ‘Sometimes I snap’.Dependant on painkillers, sleeping tablets and antidepressants, Chua also wrote that he sometimes felt like killing himself, but feared he would ‘go straight to hell no questions asked’.As the prosecution in his trial at Manchester Crown Court drew to a close yesterday after nearly three months, the jury were read the entire document which was found in a kitchen drawer of his home in Stockport after he was arrested in January 2012.Chua sat impassively in the dock as jurors were told how over more than a dozen pages of sometimes hard-to-follow broken English written in scrawling capital letters, he recounts the story of his life, beginning: ‘My name is Victorino Domingo Chua.’In the document, the father of two said he was writing ‘in case something happen to me (so) my family can continue my case or can tell somebody to look at it and work out how and (sic) angel turn to an evil person’.He added: ‘The bitter nurse confession. Got lots to tell but I just take it to my grave. My family will make history here in England.’The jury has been told the ‘case’ refers to a complaint he had lodged against his local GP surgery after it mistakenly posted his confidential medical records to a different address.In a later addition to the document dated December 2010, Chua described how he could control the number of painkillers he took for back and knee pain when he was at home – but at work he ‘can’t help it to take more than the limit’.He added: ‘I’m just telling them I’m fine and alright just to shut there (sic) mouth.‘Still inside of me I can feel the anger that any time it will explode ... just still hanging on ... can still control it but if I will be pushed they gonna be sorry.’Earlier he wrote how he was avoiding going drinking with friends, adding: ‘They thought I’m a nice person but there (is) a devil in me.’The jury was also read sections of Chua’s police interviews during which he was asked about working on two wards where he is alleged to have murdered patients Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, and 83-year-old Derek Weaver.Asked what he meant, Chua said he would tell colleagues to ‘leave me alone’ because if they distracted his work on the busy admissions unit he would be ‘back to square one again’.Chua said he normally did a 44-hour week with up to 12 hours’ overtime, doing the overnight shift so he could help his wife with their children during the day. In the document, Chua described his upbringing in the Philippines and how his life changed when his wealthy businessman father split from his mother. Once ‘the envy’ of relatives and neighbours, he and his siblings struggled to get by after the marriage breakdown.He described befriending wealthy students by buying them drugs or dealing for them, while earning extra money by doing odd jobs like washing cars. He lived with his grandmother, who he said pushed him into nursing even though ‘I don’t like it’.He had a difficult relationship with his father, he said, and when he saw him suffer a fatal heart attack in 1986 ‘I didn’t feel anything’. Chua described himself at that time as ‘a naughty boy, doing bad things’, taking medical gear from the Manila hospital where he worked and selling them to people who couldn’t afford treatment.‘I’m evil, at the same time angel,’ he wrote.Eventually he lost his job and supported his new wife and their young daughter by buying and selling cars before applying to work in Britain in 2002.He started working at care homes in Warrington and Stockport, suffering a prolapsed disc hoisting a patient in 2003 which left him dependant on painkillers, a problem made worse when he later injured his knee falling in snow.After he started work at Stepping Hill Hospital in 2009 – which he said he ‘loved’ – Chua described his state of mind as ‘can’t sleep, paranoid and mental’ and said he would stay in his room all day.He hated noise and shopping trips, adding: ‘I see small things as a big problem.’He wrote that he went to visit relatives in Japan and considered not returning, but decided to stay in England. Chua added that he sometimes wanted to ‘end my life’ but needed to be with his family, adding that ‘if I go, I go straight to hell no question ask(ed)’.Chua denies murder as well as 24 counts of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent, eight of attempting to administer poison, one of causing grievous bodily harm with intent and one of administering poison.Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.
The families of three Chinese women's rights activists detained in Beijing, have been told they'll be given conditional release, a lawyer says.A lawyer says the families of three of five Chinese women's rights activists detained in Beijing have been informed that they will be freed.Liang Xiaojun said family members of the three were on Monday told they would be given a form of conditional release that still allows charges to be brought later.Lawyers for the women, Wang Man, Zheng Churan and Wei Tingting, did not answer phone calls, and contacts for their family members were not immediately available. Calls to the Haidian District Detention Centre in western Beijing rang unanswered on Monday night.Liang said no such notice had been received for his client, Wu Rongrong, or for the fifth woman, Li Tingting, and it wasn't clear whether they would face charges.The five were detained last month as they prepared to distribute materials against domestic violence on International Women's Day on March 8. They were accused of creating a disturbance and, if convicted, could be sentenced to up to three years in prison. Five others detained at the same time have since been released.Their case has brought international expressions of concern, including from US presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, US Ambassador to the UN Samantha Power, Britain's Foreign Office and the European Union.Beijing police have refused to comment on the case and China's Foreign Ministry has responded angrily to questions about it, demanding that critics "stop interfering in China's judicial sovereignty in such a manner".
A motorist has filmed the terrifying moment a powerful tornado barrelled across a highway directly in front of his truck, almost lifting it from the road as he sheltered under a bridge in the US.Sam Smith was driving through northern Illinois on his way to Indianapolis when the skies began to darken dramatically and he spotted the twister, which appeared to be heading directly towards him on the I-39 near Lindenwood.Mr Smith, who is not a storm chaser, began filming on his iPhone as the tornado span towards him, all the while commentating calmly into his phone."This is a tornado and I can not tell which way it's going, so I don't know how to get away from it, but it looks like it's coming right towards me," he says in the footage.Mr Smith followed the lead of other motorists and pulled under a bridge, all the while filming as the tornado spins just metres in front of his truck."I have honestly never been in a tornado before."Totally crazy. It is coming right, it is coming right over the top of me. It's a little bit scary and I don't really know what to do except I guess sit here, maybe duck down."Mr Smith told the Washington Post that he had been on the phone to his young son, who asked him to take footage as the tornado approached."As it got closer it seemed likely things were going to get real bad, and so I hung up on my son without saying goodbye so he would think we just got disconnected," Mr Smith said."At one point, I could feel the truck lift and thought that was it. I was thankful I did not have my son on the phone anymore."The National Weather Service in the US said there were eight tornadoes across Illinois on Thursday, when Mr Smith filmed his encounter. The strongest tornado, which passed in front of Mr Smith, was classified EF-4, the second highest classification on the Enhanced Fujita scale.The National Weather Service estimated that tornado to be 800 metres wide, with winds reaching speeds of up to 320km/h.Two people died when the tornado struck Fairdale, Illinois, and at least 22 were injured.

The company that conducts most of America's rocket launches has released details of its next generation vehicle.The concept will be known as Vulcan, and it is expected to start operations in 2019.United Launch Alliance - the joint venture between Boeing and Lockheed Martin - currently flies the Atlas and Delta rockets.These are routinely used to loft Nasa science probes, spy satellites and other US national security missions.In time, both vehicles will be retired as the new Vulcan components come on stream.The first element to be introduced will be the first-stage booster, which will feature an all-new, all-American liquid-fuelled engine.This will enable ULA to end its use of Russian-made RD-180 rocket motors – something Congress has mandated.Politicians on Capitol Hill dislike the fact that American national security missions are launched with the aid of Russian propulsion technology.ULA's preference is to incorporate a liquid methane-oxygen power unit currently being developed by Blue Origin, the space company run by Amazon entrepreneur Jeff Bezos.When the new Vulcan booster makes its debut, it will initially be married to the current Centaur upper-stage of the Atlas.But early in the 2020s, this too will be replaced by a bespoke upper-stage that should give the new rocket a performance that allows it to exceed even the Delta-VI Heavy – the biggest, most powerful rocket in the world today, capable of putting upwards of 25 tonnes in a low-Earth orbit.Critically, though, the Vulcan will be substantially cheaper to build and operate."A Delta-VI Heavy at today’s launch rates costs about $400m, give or take, depending on the mission and its complexity. I fully expect the Next Generation Launch System to be less than half that," said Tory Bruno, president and CEO of United Launch Alliance.Some cost savings will be made by recovering and reusing the engines on the first-stage booster following a flight.The idea is that after separation from the upper-stage, the engines would detach from the propellant tanks and fall back to Earth, deploying an inflatable shield to protect them from burning up on re-entry into the atmosphere.Parachutes would then deploy and a helicopter would swoop in to pluck the engines out of the air and return them safely to the ground for servicing and re-integration into a new booster.ULA will not say how much the Vulcan development programme is costing, but it will run into the billions of dollars.ULA has to modernise, however. The priority status it has enjoyed with government contracts is coming to an end, and it is facing increasingly stiff competition – at home, from a bullish SpaceX company, whose low-cost rockets are winning favour with Nasa and commercial satellite operators; and abroad, where Europe and Russia are both moving to new-generation rocket systems that aim to reduce their launch prices also.
Mombasa, Kenya: Two human rights organisations based in Mombasa whose bank accounts were frozen for their alleged role in terrorism have now sued the Government.Muslim for Human Rights and Haki Africa, which are among the 85 organisations and entities blacklisted following the April 2 terrorist attack on Garissa University College which left 148 dead, moved to court yesterday to challenge the gazette notice issued by the Inspector General of Police linking them to terror activities.The two organisations have filed a petition under certificate of urgency before High Court judge Anyara Emukule to have their accounts unfrozen as they determine the veracity of the gazette notice. Their lawyer Yusuf Abubakar said the gazette notice issued by IG Joseph Boinett linking the two organisations to Al-Shabaab was unconstitutional, malicious and lacked evidence.
Many rejoiced yesterday as Hillary Clinton finally announced her long-awaited campaign to be President of the United States, marking the start of her fight 'to earn your vote'.But this political operator was less than impressed with the news, bursting into tears and complaining that the former First Lady and Secretary of State had stolen his thunder.Zeke Celello, who appears to be around two years old, was overcome with emotion when Clinton declared her second presidential bid, and insisted to his mother that 2016 is his year to shine.The video, uploaded by his mother Erin to Facebook in the wake of the announcement, sees the would-be candidate repeatedly state his ambition to ascend to the nation's highest office so he could 'play... with toys'.He eventually concedes that playtime is not the top priority of a Commander-in-Chief, but is still adamant that he is up to the task.Unfortunately, Zeke appears not to have realized that the U.S. Constitution prohibits anybody from holding the presidency until they are 35.However, unperturbed, he eventually takes his mother's advice and decides to run for presidency anyway.Zeke admittedly lacks the campaigning experience of Clinton, who already has to her name a period as Secretary of State, a spell in the U.S. Senate and eight years as First Lady.But he does have the advantage of youth over 67-year-old Clinton, and, unlike his more experienced rival, will not be perceived as a political insider.Accepting Ms Celello's campaign advice, he repeats: 'I'm Zeke and I'm running for President.'While he has yet to articulate a policy platform, the youngster is clearly not short on ambition.
The 'coupon election' came in 1918, while critics branded the 1929 vote - when women first had full suffrage - the 'flapper election'.And, with just 23 days to go, the 2015 general election looks to be picking up a nickname of its own - the 'selfie election'.With less than four weeks until the ballot boxes open, politicians have been trying their best to get their faces in as many places as possible - literally - by posing relentlessly for the ubiquitous photos.Conservative MPs were told at the start of the campaign to pose for 'selfies' as often as possible, to increase the party's exposure on social media websites, such as Facebook and Twitter.Since then, David Cameron has been seen donning cheesy grins on numerous occasions, as he poses beside voters during his country-wide visits.The PM, keen to show he is not out of touch, was seen posing for selfies during his visit to Alnwick, Northumberland, yesterday.But, as these images suggest, it appears the photo-taking craze has left no party untouched, with Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg and Nigel Farage also getting in on the action at every opportunity.This week, Clegg and Farage were both spotted posing with fans on the streets of Maidstone, Kent, and South Ockendon, Essex, respectively.Meanwhile, the grinning Labour leader took took charge of his own selfie shot, as he posed with staff during a campaign visit to Airedale Hospital maternity ward in Keighley, Yorkshire, on Saturday.And, so far, the tactic appears to have worked. A quick search of 'selfie election' on Twitter brings up thousands of tweets, most of which feature the grinning face of one of the party leaders.Last month, a senior Tory source admitted the 2015 General Election could become known as 'the selfie election', as party leaders find themselves mobbed by voters on the campaign trail.The source added: 'It is actually more powerful because obviously they will show their friends, post on Facebook.'He said MPs were also being told to 'use social media as the means to deliver a message'.The technique was employed to perfection during the Scottish Referendum, with Alex Salmond often seen stopping to pose for selfies with Yes campaign supporters.At the time, Facebook revealed figures detailing more than 10 million interactions surrounding the referendum in a five-week period.A senior strategist for the Yes campaign said the social media site was the most effective campaigning tool available because it offers access to nearly every voter and allows individuals to spread the messages they want to hear.
There is necessarily a tug of war between a government's obligation to provide service and its duty to remain fiscally responsible, a fact duly noted in the letter transmitting the proposed 2015-16 Los Angeles County budget to the Board of Supervisors.In this year of continuing economic recovery, budget officials recommend funding for more than 1,000 new positions. That's a lot of new employees — even in a county of 10 million people. One in every 100 county residents already is a county worker.The county has managed its pension obligations better than many local governments but has yet to develop a plan to fully fund retiree healthcare costs. That's a fiscal imperative that should be addressed before expanding the county payroll.That said, new program and payroll costs must be measured against the cost of failing to act. Mismanagement and other problems in the Department of Children and Family Services, for example, may have contributed to the deaths of children that, with better attention, might have been prevented. Not every solution requires better funding, but it's a fact that county social workers' caseloads were too heavy. Reducing them would require the county to hire more workers.The proposed budget also sets aside $75 million in anticipation of continuing large verdicts and settlements in lawsuits brought by victims of abuse by sheriff's deputies in the jails. Let's hope that the election of a new sheriff will translate into fewer jail beatings and therefore fewer payouts. But deputy misconduct was in part a result of the county locking up so many mentally ill inmates, so a solution must include continuing diversion and treatment of the mentally ill. Reducing payouts in the future requires investment today.The county will also enjoy some savings, much of which could too easily be lost in the budget's fine print. Consider, for example, the decline in the caseload of the district attorney's office, which has handed off to city prosecutors the task of handling crimes that had been felonies until the passage last November of Proposition 47.The supervisors must ensure that such savings are acknowledged and quantified. Should that money be kept with the district attorney for more prosecution? Or would it make more sense to spend it on better diversion and reentry programs, to make inmates more likely to returning to society without reverting to crime? Those are the kinds of questions the supervisors must address publicly as they begin their two-month budget process.
Indian Ink Theatre Company presentsKiss the Fish & Krishnan's DairyDirected by Justin LewisWritten by Jacob Rajan and Justin LewisAn exceptional back to back season marks Indian Ink’s return to Auckland and Wellington for 2015 - with two of their most successful shows; Kiss The Fish and Krishnan’s Diarycoming to the stages at Q Theatre and Hannah Playhouse, this June and July.Returning from a hugely successful tour of the USA, and ready to launch into Singapore next year, Kiss the Fish is once again weaving together its Balinese masked magic, ancient theatrics and modern pop culture – Freddy Mercury no less – to captivate audiences on its home tour. Last year it sold out Q Theatre and cleaned up the Chapman Tripp Theatre Awards, taking out “Best New NZ Play”, “Best Composer” and “Best Supporting Actress” of the year.“Magical, funny, ironic, sad and beautiful, Kiss the Fish brought to the stage everything and more that we have come to expect from the Indian Ink Theatre Company” Nelson Mail 2014The winds of change are sweeping the sleepy island of Karukam.

Darwin childcare professional backs Prime Minister Tony Abbott’s decision to stop payments for parents who refuse to vaccinate kidsRennae Griffith from the Nightcliff Family Centre believes the prospect of losing federal financial support could force a change of thinking among parents currently opposed to immunising their children. Mr Abbott has announced the closure of a loophole which he said would stop payments to parents worth up to $15,000 per child.“When it comes to protecting the young ones in our care, vaccination is the best thing,” Ms Griffith said.“If there’s an outbreak of chickenpox, or something, and there’s a child who’s not vaccinated, they will be excluded. I think that’s the case in most childcare centres.”Ms Griffith said while most children at Nightcliff were vaccinated she hoped Mr Abbott’s announcement could see an improvement in vaccination levels at childcare centres.“I guess that if their payments are still continuing and they’re still getting Centrelink money then there is no pressure.“But if Tony Abbott then cuts that money then the pressure will be to vaccinate.”OPINION: NOT VACCINATING YOUR KIDS IS NOT YOUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTTerritory vaccination rates are among the best in Australia.“It only takes one unvaccinated child to put others at risk of preventable diseases like whooping cough or measles,” she said.Australian Medical Association NT president Dr Robert Parker has also backed the Prime Minister’s initiative saying those refusing to immunise their children were socially irresponsible.“I heard one of the anti-immunisation people harping on about it saying it was her privilege not to give her kids immunisation and she was arguing that whole thing about herd immunity; that other people were immune therefore the herd works. That’s absolute rubbish,” Dr Parker said. “It’s quasi science.”Dr Parker said if a female was not immunised against rubella and then contracted the disease as an adult while pregnant there was a high probability their child would be born with a severe intellectual disability and could be blind and deaf.“It’s that child’s cross to bear for the rest of their life. And it’s because their grandmother didn’t have the sense, or the wider view, to immunise against rubella. I think it’s a really crap thing to do to a kid.”
A major expansion is under way at a Central Queensland prawn farm, as the business looks to keep up with growing demand.Australian Prawn Farms in Ilbilbie, south of Sarina, currently has 33 one-hectare ponds, but the expansion will add another 16 ponds and boost production by about 50 per cent.A vast area on one side of the property has been cleared and earthmoving equipment is now on site.General manager Matt West said the new ponds will be completed by October and put to use immediately."It's just started, but it will be happening pretty quickly," he said."This next 16 ponds will be ready for start-up next season."Each pond is 1.5 metres deep, holds 15 million litres of water and produces 500,000 to 700,000 individual prawns, or eight to 20 tonnes.Mr West said the business' main client, a major supermarket chain, wanted as many prawns as the farm can produce.He said one of the benefits of the expansion will be new jobs for the small community around Ilbilbie."For this size farm, we would currently employ about 30 to 40 people," he said."When we expand, you are looking at about 50 people."It's a lot of jobs for this little area."
"Not invited," was Novak Djokovic's reply on Sunday night when asked if he would be attending the wedding of his old rival and near-exact contemporary, Andy Murray. "But I wish him all the best."
While the presidential election received commendations from the international community, some prominent party members are still simmering. President Goodluck Jonathan was said to have been criticised within the ranks of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party for conceding defeat to General Muhammadu Buhari so promptly. May Agbamuche-Mbu, Jude Igbanoi and Tobi Soniyi canvassed lawyers’ opinions from the opposite sides of the divide on the highly contentious issues which flowed from the historic election. Dr. Muiz Banire the National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress asserts that the March 28 presidential elections were substantially free and fair, but Chief Ferdinand Orbih, Lead Counsel in some PDP cases faults the claim on several fronts and posits that the PDP has not ruled out proceeding to the election tribunal to challenge the outcome of the elections. Many statements that have adversely affected your party’s candidates and their reputation have been published in the media over the past few months. At any other period many of these statements may have led to successful actions in defamation, but do Electoral Campaigns serve as an unwritten exception to defamatory publications in Nigeria? Will you be advising your party to action claims for defamation resulting from abusive campaigns from this election period? Thank you very much. First, I must say that election campaigns do not constitute an exception or a defence to libel actions. A libelous or scandalous statement made during election campaigns shall in the same manner ground an action in court just like any other statement made at other times. The only thing is that during election campaigns, parties and contestants often get engrossed in strategies to win elections and hardly does anyone pay attention to filing an action in court to get damages for libel. However, at the level of APC, we take exceptions to libelous publications that cannot be justified or privileged and hence the tendency of our party to bring actions against such publications and their makers.Election campaign is not a basis for vulgar abuse and that is why we do not engage in such insalubrious recklessness. Election campaign should be issue-based and not reduced to mere opportunity to slander or libel your opponent. Where we consider any such statement to be unwarranted and deliberately concocted to defame, we definitely file actions to challenge same. A number of such cases are pending in court today filed by our party and its leaders against some other organisations and individuals that have transgressed the limits of journalism and decency.For the first time in Nigeria’s political history an opposition party is unseating an incumbent President. What factors contributed to the opposition’s victory in the polls? As I said sometime last year, we took the right steps which I insisted we must. First, we presented a popular candidate with impressive credentials, enviable records and undoubtable ability to deliver on our party’s promises. Second, we conducted a most mature campaign based on issues reminiscent of what Action Group and Unity Party of Nigeria used to do in the First and Second Republics. Third, we ensured that the campaign process was adequately monitored to reach the last Nigerian capable of voting and finally, we made sure that we monitored the votes. Despite all the efforts at tarnishing the images of our party, General Muhammadu Buhari, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and many of us, we made sure that we were not diverted from the glorious part of electioneering campaign which eventually made an average Nigerian to appreciate our party for its commitment to civilised values capable of elevating our country to higher levels. That is what we did.The presidential polls were trailed with a lot of complaints from all sides. There were complaints of failure of the card reader machines, fake PVCs in some states, underaged voters in many parts of the north and other areas where the APC had a strong presence. What is your response to these numerous complaints by the PDP? It is clear that no technology is foolproof. The card readers recorded less than one percent failure whereas the manual accreditation that we had been using before had always recorded not less than 90% failure. Then, which one is better? The card reader was able to detect fake PVCs and that was why it was used by INEC to conduct the election. The allegation that under-aged voters were allowed to vote in certain parts of the North must be treated with a lot of caution as the determination of the age of a person is not something to be done on the basis of looks alone. Tendency abounds that in certain cases of poor nutrition, a person may look underage whereas he or she is above the minimum age requirement. We must understand that in all APC States, the card reader was used substantially for accreditation and if all the persons alleged to be under-aged were accredited by the card reader, the implication is that they were of competent age when the voters’ registration exercise was carried out. Beyond all these, there is still the Tribunal avenue to test the veracity of the allegations.Prior to the March 28 election date, the present First Lady of the Federation, Mrs. Patience Jonathan made statements at a campaign rally, she was criticised for being undignified and reckless. Others have suggested that her comments were liable to prosecution at the International Criminal Court in the Hague. Is there any legal credence to that suggestion? Of course, there is legal credence to the suggestion. Anyone who promotes hate speeches may be liable to prosecution at the International Criminal Court more so if such speeches were followed by violence leading to loss of lives. The First Lady was only lucky that there was no breakdown of law and order after the election otherwise her instigation that all persons who said “change” should be stoned would have been a perfect basis for prosecution.What is your reaction to the unprecedented violence that trailed this election before, during and after the polls? Especially in Rivers State, Cross River and Akwa Ibom? It is unwarranted as there is no basis for such. There are allegations and counter allegations from different quarters which professionally I cannot adjudge. However, the role of the law enforcement agents is the one that is however questionable in this regard. Much more is required to forestall this in the nearest future so that the culture of impunity can be curtailed.The election appeared to have some ethnic and religious undertones, looking at the voting pattern. While APC led in the predominantly Muslim north, PDP led in the predominantly Christian south, south and south east. Would you say the nation is still divided along those lines? I must be honest with you, the trend will appear so.  It is wrongful, despicable and criminal. The good news however is that the president elect has assured us in his acceptance speech that such tendencies will be eliminated under his administration. Personally, it is not a healthy development and the ultimate consequences in most cases are usually not predictable.Although President Goodluck Jonathan conceded defeat and promised not to challenge the result of the polls, the PDP leadership is said to be preparing to go to the election petition tribunal. As the National Legal Adviser of the APC what is your plan? We shall meet them there. We are ever ready. We have shown them in Osun and the same way we shall show them that in all elections we won, we played by the rules as laid down by the Constitution, the Electoral Act and international standards recognized by all civilized nations. We are not crooks that would manipulate electoral process for whatever reason.The Oba of Lagos is on record to have pronounced a curse on Igbos in Lagos who fail to vote for Akinwunmi Ambode in the governorship election. What is your reaction to this? As you know, the Oba of Lagos is not a member of APC. The Oba is not Lai Mohammed who has the mandate to speak on behalf of APC nor is he Joe Igbokwe. As rightly reacted to by our Party leaders, his position does not represent that of the Party and the Party has apologised for any such wrong insinuation whilst distancing it from the statement.What is your opinion on the scenario that is currently playing out in Ekiti State where the Governor has been served an impeachment notice from APC legislators in that state? Could there be any genuine cause for his impeachment notice? I am sure that our people are not frivolous, they certainly do have impeachable grounds. You may wish to peruse the allegations contained in the Notice to decipher this. The good news is there is opportunity for defence. He can defend the allegations before the appropriate panel.There have been arguments for the establishment of an electoral offences commission to deal with violations of the electoral act. Do you support this proposition? Absolutely, I support the arguments. There is need for electoral offences commission to try electoral offences. The present Electoral Tribunals have no jurisdiction to try criminal offences emanating from electoral processes. The regular courts are also jam packed with too many cases and the courts’ schedules are full to the brim. Just like we created a special court for labour and employment matters, I mean the National Industrial Court, events have justified the need to have electoral offences commission. That is one of the ways we can prove that the law is applicable to all and nobody is above the law. Failure to take urgent steps in that direction would only portray us as unserious people which we have always shown ourselves to be.The electoral offences commission must the power to conduct summary trial. The trial process should not continue forever and there must be strict penalties for electoral offences. Anybody, no matter how highly placed, who is arrested for electoral offences, must be prosecuted. The law must not be implemented only against the poor people but big politicians who have run foul of the law must be equally prosecuted. The alternative is to priortise the trials in the regular courts or dedicate units of the regular courts during such election periods to deal specially with such offences emanating from the conduct of elections.The Mohammed Lawal Uwais Electoral Reform Committee reported that the lack of independence of the electoral commission at both the federal and state level is a deficiency in our electoral process. Considering the manner in which INEC conducted the election does this statement hold true? What can be done to safeguard the independence of INEC? I have always said it that it depends on the personality occupying the seat. Professor Jega has proved to a large extent that INEC is independent. He refused to pander to executive influences before and during the presidential election. If Jega were to be lily-livered or a compromised personality, card readers would have been discarded. If Jega were to be dependent on executive patronage, the election would not have held. He would have succumbed to the suggestion that the election be postponed indefinitely.The Constitution has largely guaranteed a great measure of independence for INEC. The appointments of INEC chairman and members are subject to constitutional tenures and not manipulative along executive whims and caprices. When illegal notice of terminal leave was being rumoured to be served on Professor Jega, I said it was not constitutionally possible as Jega’s tenure could not be terminated by that means. Jega himself was unperturbed and carried out his duty with enviable aplomb. No matter how much the Constitution is amended to make INEC further independent, I believe if a stooge occupies the stool, he would rubbish the independence. If a corrupt individual is the chairman of INEC and he is only desirous of self-enrichment as has happened in the past, he would corrupt the office and the so-called independence would be reduced to bread and butter. I insist we must ensure that only men of integrity are appointed to any office. However, we can still improve on the independence particularly in terms of funding and same extended to the states.What electoral reforms do you suggest the in-coming government should implement? They are plenty. We must look at the Electoral Act and carry out substantial amendments. Certain provisions that are not compatible with free and fair elections must be removed. For instance, the provision that forbids electronic voting must be carefully considered. The electoral process must be further strengthened to prevent rigging. We must adopt more technology capable of ensuring free and fair elections and prevent human manipulation tendencies. We need to revisit the 180 days rule, particularly as it affects retrials and many more.There are reports that APC will constitute a transition committee to be headed by the Vice-President-elect to begin the transition process from President Jonathan’s administration to the incoming administration. What criteria should be used to determine membership of the committee and what areas should be addressed to ensure a smooth transition to the new administration? Integrity and sense of responsibility. As per the areas to be addressed to ensure a smooth transition to the new administration, that would be unveiled by the Party. However, party component is equally essential and must be complimentary to the technocracy.
Tusla, Oklahoma: Prosecutors have filed homicide charges against a sheriff's department volunteer who fatally shot, apparently by accident, an unarmed suspect who was lying in the street.The district attorney's office charged Robert Bates, 73, a part-time reserve deputy with the Tulsa County Sheriff's Department, with second-degree manslaughter involving culpable negligence, punishable by up to four years in prison on Monday.Sheriff's officials said that on April 2, Bates intended to subdue the suspect, Eric Harris, 44, with a Taser, which fires electric darts to incapacitate a suspect, but instead shot him with his handgun.Before he was killed, Harris was fleeing on foot from deputies who had tried to arrest him on suspicion of selling drugs and guns. Bates was one of several officers who took part in the chase.Video shot by a body camera worn by another deputy shows the suspect being knocked to the ground, and officers struggling for a few seconds to subdue Harris. A voice can be heard saying "Taser, Taser," as if to warn other deputies to get out of the way of the device. A moment later, there is a single gunshot, and voice says, "Oh, I shot him. I'm sorry."Harris can be heard repeatedly shouting "He shot me," while a deputy kneels on the suspect's head and others yell at him to stop struggling.Tulsa County Sheriff Stanley Glanz told The Tulsa World newspaper that Bates, who owns an insurance agency, was an old friend of his who "made an error".Volunteer reserve officers have become a staple in the Tulsa sheriff's department, according to the Washington Post. The department reportedly uses about 100 of them, as well as in many other cities.It's not unusual for them to be out on assignment, Tulsa County Sheriff's Major Shannon Clark told the Tulsa World.By trade, they're bankers, doctors, lawyers, retired cops or even celebrities. They get varying degrees of training and they help the local police, not just by patrolling with them, usually at no cost, but also sometimes by bringing their own equipment, including weapons. Some departments even request donations in exchange for the positions. The Oakley, Mich., police department asks for $US1200 ($1500), according to Salon."These people drop four or five grand and dress up to look like police," Donna LaMontaine, president of the Deputy Sheriffs Association of Michigan, told the magazine. "I have a problem with that."Still, many reserve officers have been hailed as heroes. A number of them have paid with their lives. Others have taken lives.The job means the dangers of police work usually without the compensation. Some reserve officers patrol the streets on foot or on bicycles. Others ride in police cars. Some provide extra security in schools and shopping malls. Others have full police powers.In California, reserve training is broken up into three levels that total some 900 hours, the top tier ranking them as peace officers, according to Police magazine.In Tulsa, Bates had reportedly trained for hundreds of hours in homicide investigation and decontamination, police told the Tulsa World."If they have that badge on, that means they are sworn in by the sheriff," Captain John Smith with the Dorchester County Sheriff's Office, told the Journal Scene, "and the only difference between them and regular officers is they don't get paid."But there's another difference: Most cops retire long before they're 73; many retire in their 50s. Some police departments won't hire anyone past age 40 for the physically demanding jobs.But young and old alike become reservists.For some, reserve programs have become the entry level to full-time police positions. For others, they are an option for retired officers who want to stay on the streets."The reserve program is great for departments to fall back on," one PoliceOne member, Gordon Corey, said."Even though most reserves are limited commission, if you have full-commissioned officers who are willing to still volunteer as reserves, that gives departments the opportunity to utilise these officers to fulfil call-ins and vacations from full-time officers. With this option, departments won't have to worry they will make the wrong decision."With reserves who are just reserves and have full time jobs other than law enforcement jobs only make decisions based on what they learn in the reserve police academy which is far less than what a full time officer is taught in the police academy."The incident was one in a string of highly publicised shootings of unarmed black men and boys by white law enforcement officers.
The PC version of Grand Theft Auto V is finally out today, but what has actually changed and is it really the definitive version?We’ve reviewed Grand Theft Auto V twice now, once for the original last gen versions and most recently for the Xbox One and PlayStation version. It’s always been essentially the same game underneath, and that’s true for this belated PC version as well. But there are differences, important ones in some cases, and if you have a powerful enough machine that makes this the one version of Grand Theft Auto V you can’t do without.It only switched on last night (the other reason this isn’t a review), but GTA Online is up and ready to play from launch on the PC – as is the recently added online heists and all the other many downloadable extras that have been released in the last year and a half on consoles. But there are some features that are currently only on PC…Although it’s still the same game world and the same character models the graphics for the PC version run at 60 frames per second and at a full 1080p resolution – assuming your rig is up to the job. But if you’ve got a really ninja PC, and the requisite monitor, the game will even run at 4K resolution, which isn’t possible on any console game. You also get all the graphical improvements that came with last year’s current gen versions, including denser traffic, improved damage effects, a new foliage system that sees trees waving in the wind, better weather effects, improved lighting and shadows, and more virtual animals for you to feel bad about when you ‘accidentally’ run them over.The big new feature for the PC, that isn’t currently in any other version, is the new editing suite, which lets you record, edit, and share videos from both story mode and GTA Online. It’s far more advanced than anything Rockstar has done before, with special camera modes, filters, depth of field effects, and audio options. Everything can then be instantly uploaded for others to watch on YouTube or the Rockstar Games Social Club. The Director Mode actually you allows you to use the game’s characters, and even animals, to pose and act as if you were editing together an actual move. This is no doubt getting to a see a lot of use by machinima creators, and when combined with mods (see later) could mean Grand Theft Auto V ends up just as popular as a movie creation tool as a game. You can get a quick idea of the sort of thing from this video below, that Rockstar commissioned ahead of time.In terms of actual content there really isn’t anything new to the PC version. Although you do get the new Xbox One and PlayStation 4 stuff like the optional first person view, which you can turn off and on whenever you want, and an increase of the maximum player count in GTA Online to 30 people. There is a new radio station thoughm called The Lab. It’s curated and hosted by Alchemist and Oh No, and adds another 14 tracks to the game – all of which are original songs created just for Grand Theft Auto V. Also new for the PC is that you’ll be able to create your own custom soundtracks using any music from your hard drive.If you already own Grand Theft Auto V on a console, or two, then you don’t have to start again from scratch on the PC. Visit here and you’ll find out how to import your GTA Online character from any of the four console versions and carry on using it on the PC. And in the future Rockstar are promising that all console and PC updates will come out at exactly the same time. As an added incentive, proving you’re a double-dipper will unlock access to special bonus features, including a wildlife photography challenge for Franklin and a noir-esque murder mystery for Michael to solve. There’s also stock car races, new weapons including the rail gun and hatchet, and new vehicles including the Imponte Duke O’Death car (the associated bug for which has just been fixed) and Grand Theft Auto classic the Dodo seaplane.Perhaps the best thing about Grand Theft Auto V being on the PC is the one thing that Rockstar has nothing to do with: mods. Fans having been making unofficial modifications to PC games for decades, that range from adding or improving features, to changing the graphics, and customising the game out of all recognition (take a look at the super-upgraded version of Grand Theft Auto IV above – the creator of which is already planning to work with Grand Theft Auto V). Publishers are often a bit uneasy about mods though, as they don’t like people mistaking them for their own work – especially if it features unsavoury content or malicious code. As such they’ve said they’ll disable any mods that have a ‘negative impact’ on GTA Online. How tolerant they’ll be remains to be seen, but they’ve implied that they won’t generally interfere with anything done to the story mode.
The World Bank spoke yesterday on Nigeria’s economic future, saying President-elect Muhammadu Buhari’s plan to tackle corruption will have consequences.The bank projected a drop in the economic growth rate of Sub-Saharan Africa from 4.5 per cent in 2014 to 4.0 per cent in 2015.The bank’s Chief Economist for Africa, Mr Francisco Ferreira, spoke during a video conference to inaugurate ‘Africa Pulse’, a World Bank Group analysis on issues shaping Africa’s economic prospects. The conference was monitored in Abuja“I think it is very well spelt because institutions are built in parts on norms; one norm that has to be changed is the norm of impunity.“I think the decision, hopefully, will have consequences for the future as institutions will be stronger and norms will be cleaner,” Ferreira said.According to him, the downturn largely reflects the fall in the prices of oil and other commodities.“The 2015 forecast is below the 4.4 per cent average annual growth rate of the past two decades and well short of Africa’s peak growth rates of 6.4 per cent in 2002 to 2008.“Excluding South Africa, the average growth forecast for the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa is around 4.7 per cent”, Ferreira said.Ferreira said an average decline, in terms of trade for Africa is about 18 per cent, a development he said, wouldlead to losses in purchasing power for the region.He said that the decline in oil and commodity prices were among the challenges undermining the developmental gains made in the Sub-Saharan African.“There is the issue of insurgency, fatalities as a result of conflicts, violence from political groups like the Boko Haram in Nigeria and Al-Shabaab in Kenya.“The Ebola outbreak in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone has highlighted pre-existing weaknesses in the health systems of the three most affected countries, as well as others.“A World Bank study estimated that the three countries will face at least $1.6 billion in forgone economic growth in 2015,’’ he said.Also speaking, Ms Punam Chuhan-Pole, the bank’s Lead Economist said: “Large fiscal deficits and inefficient government spending remain sources of vulnerability for many countries of the region.“It is urgent that these countries strengthen their fiscal positions and fortify their resilience against external shocks.”She said beyond macroeconomic policies, there was the need for structural reforms to ignite and sustain productivity growth in all sectors in the region.Chuhan-Pole, also said the region should focus on policies that would promote growth, adding that the poor should be considered when implementing structural reforms.
The time, attention and effort devoted to reaching a deal with Iran over its nuclear ambitions has unwittingly tended to obscure the growing dangers of nuclear proliferation elsewhere in the world.South Asia, a volatile and unstable region, has been witnessing an escalation in military and nuclear rivalry, somewhat overshadowed by the understandable fears of a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.This part of the world, according to analysts, is fast becoming a race for nuclear supremacy between three powers - India, Pakistan and China (while technically not classified as South Asia, the country shares borders with both India and Pakistan). This rivalry in the eyes of many analysts is dangerous in itself but is made even more complex by the mutual suspicions and historical enmities that bedevil the region.First, take Pakistan. The country is plagued by economic and political insecurity but is locked in a fight for military bragging rights with India. The country is believed to have one of the world's fastest growing nuclear arsenals. A recent report indicated that it had tripled the number of warheads it had a decade ago.Nuclear strength is a political and military strategy in the eyes of the Pakistani governing class, a way of countering India's political and military clout. Pakistan has no official nuclear doctrine, but official communiques speak of "restraint" and "deterrence".The Pakistan government recently approved the purchase of eight submarines from China. It is not clear from reports whether they have the capacity to be equipped with nuclear missiles. The deal, said to be worth billions, is one of China's biggest arms deals. It also threatens to intensify a growing battle for military supremacy in the Indian Ocean, a stretch of sea that has long been a source of rivalry and tensions in the region.The reported deal sheds light on one other area of conflict and rivalry. China has long been one of Pakistan's main arms suppliers, accounting for half of Pakistani weapons imports, according to a report published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.China and Pakistan have been close for decades, based largely on their mutual suspicion of India.In other developments, the Pakistanis are reported to have test-fired a missile recently that appears capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. Pakistan possesses the medium-range Shaheen-III missile with a range of some 1,700 miles, leaving India easily within range. A recent leader article in the New York Times reported claims that Pakistan continues to develop short-range tactical nuclear weapons. Again, leaving India well within range.No-one should underestimate the rivalry between the two countries, informed by their troubled history, which includes outright wars in 1947, 1965 and 1971.India is estimated by analysts to have some 110 warheads but continues to expand its nuclear programme but at a slower pace, according to some reports. The country has a mixed strategy, combining short and long-range ballistic missiles, nuclear submarines and cruise missiles. It tested its first nuclear device in 1974.India has a No First Use doctrine, recently confirmed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Security is a key part of India's nuclear strategy. China's nuclear strength is a worry to India, as is its more advanced strategic weapons and its numerically superior military force. Also a worry is the traditionally close relationship between China and Pakistan, India's erstwhile enemy.Informed analysis estimates that China's nuclear weapons number some 250 warheads - a mixture of short, intermediate, and long-range ballistic missiles. China's ambitions encompass land, air and sea-based nuclear delivery systems.China's nuclear ambitions took off in the 1950s, in the wake of the Korean War. Its first nuclear test is believed to have been conducted in 1964. It is a view among informed commentators that the country's nuclear capability will continue to grow in the coming years. China has always maintained that its own No First Use policy is defensive. The country is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the NPT. It is also a signatory to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT) but has yet to ratify it.The fierce nuclear competition in South Asia is seen by many as a recipe for instability in a region already burdened with problems.It is a potentially lethal addition to the cocktail of territorial disputes and cross-border terrorism. The capacity of other world powers to influence the situation is hampered by the fact that neither India nor Pakistan belong to the NPT.Pakistan's economic and political instability also poses huge and troubling questions. The country is persistently challenged by militant groups and fears persist that these groups could get their hands on nuclear materials, despite strong insistence from Pakistani officials that its nuclear facilities are secure.America and Russia still possess more than 90% of the world's nuclear weapons but South Asia, home to three nuclear states, remains a growing worry, perhaps one that will get more attention in the coming months.
Three members of a rural Tory riding association have resigned after the party executive refused to tell them why a candidate was punted from the nomination race.Over the weekend, the president of the Progressive Conservative constituency association for Chestermere-Rocky View and two fellow board members stepped down over what sources said was the decision to “disallow” candidate Jamie Lall from challenging Wildrose defector and now PC incumbent Bruce McAllister.Riding association president John Fitzsimmons, who had previously ran for the party’s nomination in Banff-Cochrane, along with director Gloria Wilkinson and secretary Ada Rawlins all resigned their posts Saturday.Rawlins, who after volunteering with the party for 55 years decided to step down due to health reasons, said there was some dissatisfaction on the board when they weren’t given a reason for Lall — who’s now running as an independent against McAllister — having his name stricken from the ballot.“There was no reason given as to why they disqualified Jamie,” she said Monday.“This whole election is being run very differently than any I’ve been involved with over the last 55 years.”Fitzsimmons wouldn’t comment on the reasons for his decision or whether the Lall decision had anything to do with it, only saying he’s focusing on helping a pair of PC candidates in other ridings win their seats.Wilkinson couldn’t be reached, but Rawlins confirmed the pair weren’t pleased the party executive offered no reasons for Lall’s removal, despite making the request.“They certainly had good points I agreed with,” she said.Just days before the scheduled nomination vote with McAllister, Lall was told by PC executive director Kelley Charlebois to resign or he would be “disallowed.”Lall claimed he was never told the reasons behind the decision though in later statements by Charlebois and Premier Jim Prentice, both said the candidate knew the reasons why and it was up to him to make them public.Monday, Charlebois said it’s “incorrect” to interpret the resignations as having anything to do with Lall, noting that’s not what he was told by Fitzsimmons and Wilkinson.“My interpretation is it had nothing to do with Mr. Lall’s disallowance,” he said.Charlebois added it’s “not unusual” for three members of a constituency association to resign in the midst of an election campaign though he’s not aware of any others who’ve stepped down in the province’s other 86 PC constituency associations.Rawlins, who campaigned for Alberta’s first Progressive Conservative premier Peter Lougheed, said the party’s grassroots are on life support under the new administration.“It used to be the association would set all the rules and regulations — now all the directions come from HQ,” she said.“You just have to follow what they tell you.”
DNA technology is protecting school property thanks to the BNZ Safer Schools initiative.The unique programme, launched last month, provides property-marking kits to every primary, intermediate and secondary school in the Waikato District.Acting assistant commissioner Bill Searle and David Morrissey from SelectaDNA try out the marking pen.This is the second time the programme has run, with a previous campaign contributing to promising results in school-related burglaries.The latest initiative brings together the Bank of New Zealand, Ministry of Education, Crimestoppers NZ and SelectaDNA, working alongside police to help prevent crime.Acting Assistant Commissioner Districts Bill Searle, who represented police at the launch in Hamilton, was heartened by the partnerships behind the initiative.“Theft of school property disrupts our children's education and diverts funds from more productive activity when equipment has to be replaced or damage repaired, meaning the whole school community is victimised.“Police wants fewer victims. We want to reduce offending and make everyone in our society feel safer, but we can't do it alone. It's great to see community partners coming together in initiatives which contribute to our key objectives.”Over the next two years all New Zealand schools will receive a BNZ Safer Schools Pack, including a SelectaDNA property marking pen which uses a non-toxic, water-based solution that glows blue under UV light, making it easier to identify stolen item.
TORONTO — Researchers say women thinking of having their eggs frozen to preserve fertility should be aware there is no guarantee they will be able to have a baby.Angel Petropanagos of Dalhousie University says primary-care physicians can help women make an informed decision about "social" egg freezing by pointing out the medical risks and high financial costs.A woman's eggs can be retrieved following hormonal stimulation of the ovaries, then flash-frozen and stored.Each stimulation cycle can cost $5,000 to $10,000 and annual storage fees range from $300 to $500, depending on the clinic.Petropanagos says U.S. statistics show the IVF pregnancy rate using frozen and thawed eggs is 4.5 to 12 per cent among women who had their ova preserved before age 30.But she says the rates of pregnancy and live births decline when a woman freezes her eggs at an older age.Egg freezing has been used for some time to preserve fertility in young women and girls treated for cancer. But some women who perhaps have not yet met a suitable partner are also electing to cryo-preserve their ova."It's really getting marketed like it's a backup plan, it's insurance," says Petropanagos, a post-doctoral fellow at the Halifax university."The problem is that the success rate isn't really that great. It's not guaranteed, so you can spend all this time, energy and money investing in egg freezing and think you're covered and when it comes down to it 10 years down the line, the IVF won't result in a live birth."Some women might understand that, that it's still a gamble. But depending on how this is marketed, some women might see this as a guarantee when it's really not."Petropanagos says IVF to get pregnant also carries a number of risks, including multiple births, premature delivery and low birth-weight babies.The researchers' analysis is published Monday in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.
A Broken Hill GP says the Federal Government is right to take a "carrot and stick approach" to get parents to vaccinate kids.Parents who refuse to vaccinate their child would be denied childcare rebates under the Abbott Government's 'no jab, no pay' proposal.National Health Performance Authority data showed the Far West Medicare Local catchment has Australia's lowest recorded number of conscientious objections.Broken Hill doctor Ramu Nachiappan said he was surprised it had taken so long for the Government to consider tougher measures."Certainly education should be at the forefront, however if we've missed the opportunity and don't adequately educate, or people are putting on mufflers and not willing to listen, then perhaps the carrot and stick approach, which is what the Government has taken, [should be] implemented," he said."This is one instance where the government probably has gone down the right road, I don't necessarily disagree with what they're advocating at this stage."Dr Nachiappan said anti-vaccination groups, which represented "the vast minority", were having too much influence on the general public."I am concerned in the time that I've been in Broken Hill to see that more and more parents, and now that it's the flu season, adults, electing to not have vaccinations and that is a cause for concern," he said."For instance in my practice, last year we sent out 3,200 flu vaccine reminder letters to patients who qualified for a free vaccine, however only 1,200 took that up."I've been aghast that about half, or less than half, partake in a flu vaccine."
Alberta NDP Leader Rachel Notley says that she did not ask one of her candidates to resign after he was charged with simple assault over the weekend.Notley says Jason Soklofske, the candidate for Medicine Hat, resigned on his own without being asked.Soklofske quit after he was charged with assault following an altercation while campaigning Saturday.Police have only said the altercation involved one other person but did not give further details.Notley says the party hopes to have a replacement in place in the next couple of days.
It was unclear how Russia would vote on the draft by council member Jordan and Gulf Arab states. Russia had unsuccessfully suggested during negotiations that the text call for an immediate ceasefire and that an arms embargo include President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government, diplomats said.The Russian U.N. mission declined to comment on Monday on whether it would support the resolution, abstain or veto.Saudi Arabia launched air strikes against the Iran-allied Houthis in neighbouring Yemen last month with a coalition made up mainly of four Gulf Arab allies. The United States said last week it is speeding up arms supplies to the coalition.Iran on Monday urged the formation of a new Yemeni government and offered to assist in a political transition.The draft U.N. resolution would impose a global asset freeze and travel ban on Ahmed Saleh, the former head of Yemen's elite Republican Guard, and on Abdulmalik al-Houthi, a top leader of the Shi'ite Houthi group.Saleh's father, former Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and two other senior Houthi leaders, Abd al-Khaliq al-Huthi and Abdullah Yahya al Hakim, were blacklisted by the Security Council in November. Yemeni soldiers loyal to the former president are fighting alongside the Houthis.The draft resolution would impose an arms embargo on the five men and "those acting on their behalf or at their direction in Yemen" - effectively the Houthi and soldiers loyal to Saleh.The resolution also "calls upon Member States, in particular States neighbouring Yemen, to inspect ... all cargo to Yemen" if they have reasonable grounds to believe it contains weapons destined for the poor Arabian peninsula country.It demands the Houthis stop fighting and withdraw from areas they have seized, including the capital Sanaa. It also expresses concern at "destabilising actions" taken by former President Saleh "including supporting the Houthis' actions."Russia put forward its own draft resolution earlier this month demanding "regular and obligatory humanitarian pauses in the air strikes by the coalition" to allow for the evacuation of foreigners. The Jordan and Gulf Arab text calls on all parties to facilitate the evacuation of foreigners.

While the presidential election received commendations from the international community, some prominent party members are still simmering. President Goodluck Jonathan was said to have been criticised within the ranks of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party for conceding defeat to General Muhammadu Buhari so promptly. May Agbamuche-Mbu, Jude Igbanoi and Tobi Soniyi canvassed lawyers’ opinions from the opposite sides of the divide on the highly contentious issues which flowed from the historic election. Dr. Muiz Banire the National Legal Adviser of the All Progressives Congress asserts that the March 28 presidential elections were substantially free and fair, but Chief Ferdinand Orbih, Lead Counsel in some PDP cases faults the claim on several fronts and posits that the PDP has not ruled out proceeding to the election tribunal to challenge the outcome of the elections. Many statements in the news media have adversely affected the candidates of the political parties that are involved in the current national elections over the past few months. At any other period many of these statements may have led to successful actions in defamation, but do electoral campaigns serve as an unwritten exception to defamatory publications in Nigeria? There is no separate law governing defamatory statements during elections and another one at other times. A person’s reputation remains his most valuable asset. The fact that we are in electioneering period cannot change that. The reason why these publications are not attracting the number of libel actions this time, is that some of the people affected know that what their opponents are saying about them is true.I have seen some documentaries about some politicians that are not only backed by facts and figures but also by pictorial and other documentary pieces of evidence. Such a politician does not have any reputation to protect. He will not even have the courage to go to court because going to court will not only be an exercise in futility but it will lead to further negative exposure.President Goodluck Jonathan quickly conceded defeat in the just concluded presidential elections but will his party challenge the polls at the elections petition tribunal? Let me quickly join millions of Nigeria in congratulating the President for congratulating the President elect, General Muhammadu Buhari. In every contest between two people one person is bound to win and another is be bound to be adjudged the looser. The refusal to accept defeat has been the bane of our electoral system. You can see that the congratulatory message of the President completely defused the tension that had built up to breaking point in one fell swoop. The international news media had to pack their  baggages for their return flight home because there was no violence, no civil war, no break-up of Nigeria to report to the outside world. The action of the President is even more commendable when we remember that the needless loss of lives and wanton destruction of property that greeted the outcome of the 2011 elections would have be avoided if the present President-elect had picked up the phone to congratulate the President when the results were announced.Having said that, I do not know whether or not his party will go to court because I am neither a member nor the spokesperson of the PDP but our democracy will be the worse for it if results are not tested in a duly constituted Tribunal or Court set up for that purpose. I have been involved in elections and election petitions since 1988. And I can tell you from experience that it is humanly impossible for almost two million voters to be accredited in a state and for that same number to vote and for there not to be any incidence of malpractice as some Resident Electoral Commissioners reported during the collation of the Presidential election results. What of the malfunctioning of card readers during the elections? How many people were disenfranchised as a result? What of the pictures of children voting that we saw in the various news media? Surely, that was in gross violation of the provisions of the law and the Constitution. What of systematic rigging and frustration of voters in some places, occasioned by failure and/or negligence of INEC to deliver electoral materials on time? All these and many more will be swept under the carpet if the results are not subjected to the acid test of judicial scrutiny. In the euphoria of victory let the victors and the vanquished remember that every Nigerian has a duty to continue to sanitise our electoral process.The March 28 election has been hailed by international observers as free and fair. Do you agree with this assessment? I have partly answered this question in my response to  your immediately preceding question. The summary of what I have said is that given my experience in these matters, I will prefer a situation where these results are subjected to judicial scrutiny before I can believe some of the figures that emanated from some states during the election. The verdict of the international observers may well be their own perception of the elections. Let me use one of our popular local parlances here: what an international observer may not see from the top of the tallest palm tree can be seen by an area boy (a child of this environment) lying on his bed in his bedroom.The election was said to be highly monetised. The PDP for instance raised over N21b in one fell swoop at a fund raising dinner. What is your view on political campaign funding against the backdrop of the provisions of the Electoral Act 2010 (as amended)? I know that you are to ask the questions and I am to answer them but permit me to reverse the role. How much did the APC raise? PDP recklessly announced its own in the news media and that is why we know what they raised. Let me tell you this: all the major parties are guilty of breaching the provisions of the Electoral Act in terms of exceeding spending limits on fund raising or donations by individuals or corporate bodies. Our political parties will continue their breaches of these limits laid down by law because INEC has failed woefully in its duty to monitor and audit their accounts in this regard. And to my knowledge no sanctions have been applied to check this. The result is that our political space has been over monetised. Perhaps INEC is over saddled with too many responsibilities. And we need to unbundle it by creating another body to register and regulate the activities of political parties.There was a lot of bloodshed in many parts of the country during this election, despite the fact that the two presidential candidates entered into a pact of non-violence. Is the problem with eliminating election related violence the lack of consequence that comes from non-binding agreements and the inability to penalise those who incite election related violence? How can violence be prevented in future elections? The problem of violence stems from both the fact that politicians enter into meaningless non-binding agreements and the perennial problem of the inability of our law enforcement agencies to investigate, prosecute and penalise practitioners of violence in our body polity. It may be due to more of the former than the latter. Let me give you an example: over 800 people were alleged to have died in the orgy of violence that trailed the 2011 elections. Those who died included some innocent youth corps member. Till date our justice delivery system could not fish out those responsible for those deaths, prosecute and punish them for the crimes. Why won’t the country continue to experience violence during electioneering periods? It is as if politicians are licensed to burn, loot, and kill during elections. The simple truth is that you will always have a reign of impunity where there are no appropriate sanctions for deviant behavior.The military was allegedly deployed in some parts of the country. In Edo State for instance, the governor’s house was said to have been surrounded with soldiers who restricted his movement throughout the election. What is your opinion on the deployment of troops during elections? The deployment of troops to assist the police to maintain law and order during elections is very much in order. If the deployment of troops is for any other purpose, that will be unconstitutional and most undesirable. I have not heard of soldiers being deployed to conduct elections. I tell you quite frankly that no free and fair election can be conducted without adequate security for election materials (both sensitive and non-sensitive materials), INEC personnel, and indeed the electorate. And if we can get this only through deployment of soldiers, so be it.As for the allegation that soldiers restricted the movement of the Governor of Edo State during the last election, I cannot verify that. But even if that was the case, all I can say is that it was in line with the general restriction of movement on Election Day. You were only permitted to go to your polling unit for voting purposes only. A governor has no role to play in the voting process except to go and cast his vote and return to his house. If the governor was prevented from voting, that would be wrong. A governor moving around on Election Day with the full complement of security personnel will constitute an undue interference with the electoral process.Traditional rulers and the clergy who otherwise are supposed to be apolitical were accused of dabbling into politics in some parts of the country during this election. Would their actions and statements have had any impact on voting patterns? I am not aware of any statutory or Constitutional provision barring traditional rulers or the clergy from having political preferences. If there was, the law would have gone further to prevent them from voting. To vote is to exercise your right of choice of political preferences.Having said that, I must quickly add that the position they occupy in the society makes it incumbent on them to keep their preferences to themselves. They are as it were, our lords spiritual and our lords temporal. They are the fathers of all within their domain and their congregations. How can a father side one child against the other in a contest. It is even worse when a father campaigns against one child against another.As to whether their actions or statements had any impact on the election, that is difficult to say. In Edo, one traditional chief told us that the oracle has spoken to the effect that the Benin people will not vote for President Goodluck Jonathan, but the outcome of the presidential election in Edo South Senatorial district proved otherwise. The President and in his party the PDP had a majority of the votes cast at every election in the oracle’s area at the elections held on the 28th of March, 2015.Oba Riliwanu Akiolu of Lagos made controversial statements regarding the support of a gubernatorial candidate he did not endorse. It has drawn much criticism, and public indignation but separate from this what is your legal opinion of the significance of his statements? If the statements credited to the highly respected Oba to the effect that if the members of his audience did not vote for a particular candidate of his choice they will drown within seven days, are true, they constitute a violation of the peoples’ right to vote for persons of their choice. The right to vote for a person of one’s choice is a fundamental human right and is therefore sacrosanct. The statements if true would constitute a violation of the peoples’ right to be free from discrimination on the ground of tribe, religion, or sex. I sincerely hope that the highly respected Oba was misquoted.To what extent would you say Professor Attahiru Jega complied with the Electoral Act and the Constitution in the conduct of this election? That’s a tough one to answer. The INEC chairman tried his best to comply with the provisions of the constitution but whether his best was good enough may depend on who is marking the Professor’s examination script. Those who won the elections at the various levels of the process will score him 100% while those who lost may score him 20% or even less.One thing we cannot run away from is that there were lapses like you must have in every human endeavour. I have this nagging feeling that these lapses were either due to deliberate acts or could have been avoided. Why for instance must we continue to have delays in the distribution of electoral materials? You may not hold Jega responsible because to the best of my knowledge, these materials were sent to all the states of the Federation before the day of the election. The delay may have been due to either the deliberate reckless acts of some of the RECs or due to the gross incompetence of some of them or both.Finally, I am not too sure whether the use of card readers for accreditation of voters was in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act which expressly prohibits electronic voting. My humble view is reinforced by the legal principle that voting is a process of which accreditation is a part.There have been arguments for the establishment of an electoral offences commission to deal with violations of the Electoral act. Do you support this proposition? Establishment of commissions to address failures of the general structures of government put in place under the constitution has become a way of life for Nigerians. The EFCC and the ICPC are classic examples of situations where we have to resort to creation of commissions to address specific failure of the police to investigate and prosecute financial crimes and corruption. We can as well have an Examination Malpractices Commission to address the problem of examination malpractices that bedevil our educational system. So, to go back to your question, I have already pointed out that the total absence of consequences is what is fueling violence in our political system. So, if the creation of an Electoral Offences Commission will check this hydra-headed monster, then, why shouldn’t we have one? The Mohammed Lawal Uwais Electoral Reform Committee reported that the lack of independence of the electoral commission at both the federal and state level is a deficiency in our electoral process. Considering the manner in which INEC conducted the election does this statement hold true? What can be done to safeguard the independence of INEC? The independence or lack of it will always depend on the personality of who heads INEC and that of the President at any given time. INEC at this point in time is perceived to be independent because we have a President who promised us non-interference with its operations and a Professor Attahiru Jega who is naturally stubborn. The President kept his promise not to interfere with INEC operations even when its mode of operations ran counter to his views and that of his party on the issues of card reader for instance. If the President wanted to remove Jega, he would have done so and the heavens would not have fallen. Jega would have gone to court and a smart lawyer defending the President would have kept that case in court while another chairman would have conducted the March, 28, 2015 elections. If you remember, a similar thing happened when Sanusi was removed as Governor of Central Bank and when Honourable Justice Ayo Isa Salami was removed as the President of the Court of Appeal. But the President did not travel that road. He kept to his promise while Professor Jega stubbornly kept to his plan to use card readers for the election. The rest they say is now history.What electoral reforms do you suggest the in-coming government should implement? The law should be amended to either let Nigerians have full electronic voting or full analogue or manual process. What we have at the moment is like a hermaphrodite-neither analogue nor digital. I believe that a fully digital process will help the nation to get rid of the perennial logistical problems that bedevil our electoral process. And a digital process is less prone to manipulations of our wily politicians. It will also empower Nigerians who are registered to vote to cast their votes from any location they find themselves on Election Day in Nigeria. There will be no need for this biblical exodus which our people embark on at every election.We should eliminate the State Independent Electoral Commissions because there is nothing independent in their operations. They are mere appendages of the various state governors. That is why no ruling party to my knowledge has scored less than 90% of the votes at any local government election in any state of the country. In some states the state electoral bodies would announce results of an election even when the process of casting of votes is yet to be concluded.The Chief Justice of Nigeria last week said he was under pressure by politicians to truncate this electoral process. As a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, what are your views on his statement? Any politician who puts pressure on the Chief Justice of Nigeria to truncate the electoral process does not have the interest of this country at heart. Any politician who is dissatisfied with the electoral process should go to the Court or Election Petitions Tribunal to ventilate his grievance. Any other step will be an ill wind which will not blow Nigeria any good. Thank God we are confident that that we have a CJN that will not yield to that type of nonsense.Are the Ekiti State lawmakers right to seek the removal of Governor Ayo Fayose, so soon after his election? Something may be right or wrong depending on the facts surrounding it. I do not have the articles of impeachment. I hope that the lawmakers are not playing politics with the issue of impeachment. If they are they should retrace their steps lest an impression be created that governors elected on the platform of the PDP have become endangered species.What is your view on politicians defecting from one political party to another? It is better to direct this question to the defecting politician. I am not a politician. That being the case, it is difficult for me as a lawyer to understand the rationale for this. It is not just the fact of the defection that makes one uncomfortable but the caliber of the people that are defecting is frightening. Former governors, senators, and other legislators and high party operators at various levels of governance are on the move to the APC. Some have even confessed that they worked for the APC at the March, 28 elections.My take on this is that the PDP does not need these kinds of politicians to survive. The next few years will be tough for the party. A party that has been in power for 16 years will suddenly have to learn how to play opposition politics. The situation is like an adult who has been eating with his right hand all his life and who is suddenly forced to eat with his left hand. PDP will need tough, committed resolute men of steel who are prepared to rise from the ashes of its present circumstance. Those leaving are not the type of men required in these times.Do you share the view that the law on defection should be tightened to reduce the spate of defections we now witness? I am of the humble but very firm view that the law against defection of elected legislators elected on the platform of a political party to a different one is tight enough. The law as it stands only permits defection when your defection is as a result of a division within the party on whose platform you were elected. Tough as it is politicians have made nonsense of this provision.And the courts or the lawyers have not helped matters because a strict and quick decisive interpretation of the extant provisions of the Constitution will curtail the incessant movement or defection of politicians from one party to another.What is your opinion on the provisions of section 285(6) of the Constitution which prescribes 180 days for Election Tribunals to determine a petition? Do you agree with the view that the provisions violate fair hearing? This an interesting question. To choose between the situation that prevailed before the amendment prescribed 180 for the filing, hearing and determination of an election petition is like a choice between the devil and the deep blue sea. Or a choice between a rock and a hard surface. Before the amendment, election petitions used to drag endlessly. In some instances it took three out of a four year tenure to determine the winner of an election. That was a most undesirable situation which the amendment that introduced 180 was designed to check. The question which arises is: has the amendment cured the mischief it was designed to cure. The answer is yes but in curing it, it has created another problem altogether. Election petitions now expire without being heard on the merit leading to complaints of denial of fair hearing. Do we then revert to how petitions were handled before the amendment. My answer is an emphatic NO. Instead of going back to the bad old days, we can fine tune the present prescription of 180 days. For instance instead of time running from the time an appeal is filed in an election matter, the law can be amended so that the time for determining an appeal can start running from when the record of proceeding is transmitted to the Court of Appeal.Again, a lot of time is wasted on preliminary applications and pre-trial before the commencement of the actual hearing of petition. The law can be amended for the 180 days to start running from the time the tribunal starts to hear the testimony of witnesses.What are your suggestions on restructuring the PDP to make it a viable opposition against APC? I am not a politician. So, I lay no claim to any particular expertise in this field and even if I had, they must pay for it. A lot needs to be done, but I will not serve PDP any free lunch.
History has indeed been made in our country in so many ways by the singular act of President Goodluck Jonathan conceding defeat to Major General Muhammadu Buhari. This act in itself has been celebrated nonstop in the last two weeks and has brought a rare and welcome ray of hope to our democratic system. We also cannot but acknowledge that the presidential and national assembly elections have clearly indicated the power of the collective will of the people, which has been glaring for all to see based on recent political happenings. We also hope that this new beginning will bring the desired respect the Nigerian people deserve from their representatives and those who govern them even as voters have finally realised that they have a decisive role to play in determining whom they want as leaders, a timely, indeed triumphant development that has led to the strengthening of democracy in Nigeria.With the presidential and national assembly elections behind us one cannot but marvel at the shameful lack of political sophistication exhibited in recent times. The spate of defections from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC) by hitherto ‘party loyalists’ at such an alarming rate indicates that our political scene remains populated by base politicians who do not in any way operate on principle. It is clear that as there are no deterring consequences for defections from one political party to another, we will continue to witness yet more ‘epiphanies’ as our politicians keep on defecting without let or hindrance.This may not all be such a great surprise as our political parties still lack solid ideological foundations compared to the political structures for instance in the West such as in the United Kingdom, where the Conservatives favour cuts in government spending and are generally Euro sceptic while Labour is known for its social democracy and promoting the rights of the working class whilst also being more welcoming of closer ties to continental Europe. In the United States, the Democratic Party since the 1930s has promoted a social-liberal and centre-left platform, supporting a mixed economy and social justice. The party's philosophy of modern American liberalism advocates social and economic equality, along with the welfare state. It pursues a mixed economy by providing government intervention and regulation in the economy. Conversely the Republican Party's conservatism involves supporting free market capitalism, limited government, a strong national defence, opposition to regulation and labour unions and the support of socially conservative policies.Back on home turf one wonders what ideologies drive the major political parties apart from ethnicity, religion and strategic alliances because the speed of defections connotes a mentality of needing to be with the winning party at all costs, in order to preserve and protect one’s ‘daily bread.’ With this new beginning and clear move in the right direction we hope and pray that we might someday be able to confidently identify a political party with a solid ideological platform.Immediately after the March 28th elections new alliances and strategies were being perfected on a daily basis as parties swung into action depending on their performance at the polls. They either sought to salvage what remained of their support base or to consolidate on their recent gains and building from these starting points embarked upon aggressive campaigns for the governorship elections that were as fierce and provocative as those that came before, with interest groups, political parties and prominent individuals all going overboard in their bid to drive their message home and endorse their candidates. Such shenanigans even obliged the President to release a statement through his media aide stating that ‘the President condemns the very unseemly attempt by some politicians, groups and individuals to intimidate others, heat up the polity and cause public disorder and disaffection in the aftermath of the Presidential and National Assembly elections.' It further stated that 'President Jonathan is especially concerned about the negative triumphalism that has been put on display by certain elements since March 31 which flies in the face of his personal commitment to post-election peace, unity and national stability. The President calls on all those, who through their actions and utterances, have been promoting divisiveness, sectionalism and ethnic hatred in the country following the outcome of the March 28 elections to cease and desist from actions that detract from the true spirit and culture of democracy envisioned by patriotic men and women of goodwill in Nigeria.’Whether or not these apposite warnings will be heeded, time will soon enough tell but lessons do not seem to be being learnt as election suits, as per usual, are being instituted right up to the 11th hour before the elections as, for example, in a current suit challenging the eligibility APC gubernatorial candidate Akinwunmi Ambode’s eligibility to contest last Saturday's elections and seeking an order to restrain INEC from recognising Ambode. The plaintiffs were challenging their disenfranchisement in the party’s primaries but the court in dismissing the suit stated that the subject matter of the case was an intra-party affair and that the plaintiffs failed to show they had sufficient interest in the reliefs sought. One can understand the position of the court regarding party primaries because it is a matter that is left to the party’s control and discretion except for some guidelines under Section 87 (1-4) of the Electoral Act 2010 which states  that (1)‘A political party seeking to nominate candidates for elections under this Act shall hold primaries for aspirants to all elective positions; (2) The procedure for the nomination of candidates by political parties for the various elective positions shall be by direct or indirect primaries. (3) A political party that adopts the direct primaries procedure shall ensure that all aspirants are given equal opportunity of being voted for by members of the party. (4) A political party that adopts the system of indirect primaries for the choice of its candidate shall adopt the procedure outlined below: (b) In the case of nominations to the position of Governorship candidate, a political party shall, where they intend to sponsor candidates: (i) hold special congress in each of the local government areas of the State with delegates voting for each of the aspirants at the congress to be held in designated centres on specified dates. (ii) The aspirant with the highest number of votes at the end of voting shall be declared the winner of the primaries of the party and aspirant’s name shall be forwarded to the Commission as the candidate of the party, for the particular State.’ Sadly, equal opportunity has never been the order of the day in our political landscape when it comes to party primaries, as even personal assistants have found their way into the upper echelons of the National Assembly and we can unfortunately see the effect of the legislative endeavours of such, as endless bills continue to await passing into law. It is evidently such a lack of equal opportunity that discourages the right calibre of people from putting themselves up for nomination.It has been a time of petitions galore, flying left, right and centre calling for the removal of Resident Electoral Officers (RECs) in various states. Matters took a drastic turn in Rivers state when a coalition of 16 parties stormed the national headquarters of INEC demanding the immediate removal of the state REC, Ms. Gesilia Khan. The coalition alleged that the REC connived with the PDP and its governorship candidate Nyesom Wike. They also called for the removal of the Head of Operations at INEC. Similarly the Director of the APC governorship campaign also demanded for the removal of the Akwa Ibom REC and all electoral officers in the local government areas in the state, alleging that the REC and other INEC officials were actively involved in the manipulation of results during the presidential and national assembly elections. It all shows that these politicians are not aware of the laws governing the electoral process. In preparation for future elections it is time that party officials and the electorate alike start to educate themselves about the laws that govern the politics of our country.All the hue and cry about removing RECs will come to nothing as, in order to remove a Resident Electoral Commissioner, Section 6 (3) of the Electoral Act provides that 'The Resident Electoral Commissioner appointed pursuant to the Constitution may only be removed by the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Federation acting on an address supported by 2/3 majority of the Senate praying that he be so removed for inability to discharge the functions of the office (whether arising from infirmity of mind or body or any other cause) or for misconduct.' One can easily understand the rationale behind this provision which is to preserve the independence of the office of officials in INEC and also because without it, political parties would be able to easily remove such electoral officers according to their whims and caprices, even as their independence is crucial to the electoral process.Just as we approached the final leg of this electoral process, vehement attempts were made to impeach the Ekiti State Governor Ayodele Fayose and his deputy Kolapo Olusola. The Governor has had to seek an interim injunction from the Federal High Court, Abuja consequent upon which Justice Ahmed Mohammed ordered the parties to appear in court on April 16th. Amongst other reliefs, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction setting aside the impeachment notice and all steps taken by the defendants to impeach the governor and a further order preventing the Chief Judge of Ekiti State, Justice Ayodeji Daramola from taking any steps or action in relation to the request of the 1st defendant for the purpose of appointing a panel of seven persons to investigate purported allegations of gross misconduct against the governor.On the validity of the impeachment notice served on Ayodele Fayose it has been argued that it was so valid because the 19 APC members that signed the notice were more than the one-third of the total legislators required by the Constitution and according to Section 96 (1) of the Constitution 'a quorum of a House of Assembly shall be one-third of all the members of the House.' Furthermore, Section 188 (2) of the Constitution states that 'whenever a notice of any allegation in writing is signed by not less than one-third of the members of the House of Assembly, the Speaker shall, within seven days of the receipt, cause a copy to be served on the holder of the office and on each member of the House of Assembly.’ A major battle is being played out in Ekiti and how this will be resolved can only but be imagined as the governor’s party is in the minority in the state house of assembly.As we wave goodbye to the groundbreaking and quite unforgettable 2015 elections we must look to the future positively, hanging onto the words of the President-elect Muhammadu Buhari in his acceptance speech that ‘there shall no longer be a ruling party again: APC will be your governing party. We shall faithfully serve you. We shall never rule over the people as if they were subservient to government.’ He further added ‘While we pledge to begin doing our best without delay, we would like to appeal to all Nigerians to appreciate the gravity of our situation, so that we become more realistic in our expectations.’ This sums up our earnest hopes. President-elect Buhari could not have said it better.
(Reuters) - Honda Motor Co Ltd's American unit on Monday confirmed that a faulty airbag inflator made by Takata Corp ruptured in a March 20 crash of a car in Florida, injuring the driver.A Honda vehicle's airbag exploded and a piece of metal shot from the bag into the driver's neck, police and hospital reports said last week.The 2003 model Honda Civic involved in the crash is included in a recall affecting the passenger's front airbag inflator, American Honda said in a statement. Takata airbags have been linked to at least six deaths so far, all involving Honda cars.Honda also said it had sent two notices to the owner of the car before the crash, the first in September.Honda said on March 19 it would add more than 100,000 vehicles to a U.S. recall related to potentially defective airbags made by Takata that can deploy with too much force and spray occupants with metal shards.Honda said it was in touch with representatives of the injured driver to investigate the situation further.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration was not immediately available for comment.
Hillary Clinton has a formidable foreign affairs background that would help any presidential candidacy, but there's one Republican who could beat her at her own game and take the Oval Office, writes Dougal Robinson.Hillary Clinton is widely expected to be the Democratic Party's presidential candidate in 2016.The former first lady, senator and secretary of state is so far in front of her colleagues on the important indicators - polling, fundraising, and national name recognition - that few Democrats have dared dip their toes in possible presidential water.Assuming Clinton does decide to run for president, the candidate she fears most may well be Marco Rubio.Why? Because Senator Rubio's emphasis on foreign affairs makes him well suited to take on the former secretary of state.The battlelines have already been drawn. Clinton's recently released memoir, aptly titled Hard Choices, casts the author as a pragmatic policy wonk during her four-year tenure as the United States' leading diplomat.Rubio appears unfazed by Clinton's foreign policy resume, saying unequivocally in an interview in May: "If you look at the diplomacy that was pursued in her time in the State Department, it has failed everywhere in the world."Foreign policy is set to play a disproportionately important role in the 2016 election and the politics overwhelmingly favour Republicans. Polls consistently find that just 35 per cent of Americans approve of president Obama's handling of foreign policy, compared with 55 per cent who disapprove. So Republicans will ceaselessly condemn Obama's foreign policy failures, and the administration's first secretary of state will be spared no criticism.If Clinton is to break the highest glass ceiling in America, she will have to pass the so-called commander-in-chief test. Republicans will invoke Benghazi ad nauseam to fuel a perception that Clinton is unfit to occupy the Oval Office.The death of ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans continues to have currency: conservatives contend that political considerations prior to the 2012 election led Susan Rice, the national security advisor, to falsely attribute the attacks to an anti-Muslim internet video, and that Clinton's State Department took insufficient steps to safeguard the security of the US Consulate.Little surprise that Clinton describes Benghazi, which consistently ranks as the top negative in her entire political career, as the "biggest regret" of her tenure as secretary of state.Enter Senator Rubio: "She has to have some level of responsibility" for a "systemic breakdown of the State Department's security apparatus."More broadly, Clinton will have to counter the inevitable accusation that she was responsible for a weakening of US stature in foreign affairs. Although the former secretary of state comes across as more hawkish than president Obama in Hard Choices, Republicans will not allow her any distance from an unpopular administration that is perceived to have presided over a decline in the United States' global power.A 2013 Pew/Council on Foreign Relations poll found that 53 per cent of Americans believe that their country is playing a less important and powerful role in the world. The 12-point increase on the same poll four years ago, during Obama's first year in office, gives Republicans every reason to blame the president. Indeed, Obama's penchant for negotiation and multilateralism is at odds with a deep-seated pride among many Americans who think of their country as number one; the righteous nation that defeated the "evil empire" and remains the world's only superpower.Rubio, who believes that the United States is "the exception and not the rule, in human history", is the Republican best placed to capitalise on the prevailing political winds. He trumpets the United States' "unparalleled military might". And by telling voters that the world is "right on the verge ... of a new American century," Rubio appeals to the collective national ego.Conservatives are attracted to Rubio's message, and his experience in foreign affairs stands out among Republican hopefuls. With the possible exception of senator Rand Paul's brand of isolationism, Rubio is the only Republican to have put foreign policy at the centre of his nascent campaign.During the time I spent this year seconded to Rubio's Washington office on an Australian Congressional Fellowship, I saw first-hand how highly Rubio values American global engagement. He employs three foreign policy hands and hosts a visiting fellow from the State Department, a larger foreign policy footprint than other senate offices, save the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.Rubio often speaks on foreign affairs on the senate floor, has travelled widely, and has made a series of major foreign policy speeches in the US and overseas. Current and former state governors - Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Jeb Bush and Rick Perry - will struggle to gain traction on foreign policy against Rubio.Of course the Rubio candidacy faces many obstacles. In the Republican primaries, he will inevitably face strident criticism from the right over his support last year for a comprehensive immigration reform bill that provided an eventual path to US citizenship for illegal immigrants (who are overwhelmingly Latino, and number 11 million). But a silver lining remains. Rubio is a fluent Spanish speaker of Cuban descent and could turn around his party's fortunes with Latinos in a nationwide election.If Republicans lose the Latino vote by 71 per cent to 27 per cent, as Mitt Romney did in 2012, they can kiss the Oval Office goodbye for another four years.For all the hype about Tea Party favourites like senator Ted Cruz and governor Walker, Republicans typically nominate the candidate most likely to win the general election.Their prospects for retaking the White House in 2016 will be raised by rallying behind a standard-bearer who can counter Clinton on foreign policy. Rubio might well emerge as the Republican Party's best choice.Dougal Robinson is an AAA-ANU Congressional Research Fellow, placed in senator Rubio's Washington office in early 2014.

Richmond defender Bachar Houli says his AFL side didn't turn up with the right attitude in their 19-point loss to the Western Bulldogs last round.After an impressive opening round win over Carlton, the Tigers were off the pace at the MCG."Our attitude was the main bit that came out of our review," Houli said."We lacked intensity in certain areas and it goes to show that if you don't come with the right attitude you're going to come out second best."We've held each other accountable and we're going to come out with the right attitude from the first bounce."Richmond face Brisbane at the Gabba on Saturday night with star midfielder Brett Deledio set to play after recovering from a calf injury as well as serving a suspension.
Paddy Power clearly haven't learned anything after their highly controversial Oscar Pistorius promotion last year. Not all publicity is good publicity.Ahead of tonight's meeting between Liverpool and Newcastle, they tweeted: “Newcastle have suffered more Kop beatings over the last 20 years than an unarmed African-American male” accompanied by a picture of a smiling Brendan RodgersSome Twitter users have labelled the post as racist while others have viewed it as the latest offensive publicity campaign by the Irish bookmaker.Paddy Power told Independent.ie: “It’s clearly an acerbic reference to recent police activity in the US. And obviously, no offence was meant.” Here is some of the reaction on social media to the post:The tweet follows on from a succession of stories in the US regarding police shootings of African Americans.Paddy Power's controversial advert about the outcome of the Oscar Pistorious murder trial was the most complained about advertisement in Britain last year.After receiving 5,525 complaints the Advertising Standards Authority pulled the ad on the grounds that it trivialised "the issues surrounding a murder trial, the death of a woman and disability."The Paddy Power ad received three times as many as the next as the next most complained about advert in Britain last year.Pistorius was last year jailed for five years for killing girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, although he could be let out this year.
Scarlets fly-half Rhys Priestland admits moving to Bath this summer may harm his Wales career.Priestland, 28, says he is happy with the move despite the expected adverse impact on his Wales chances."I'm comfortable with my decision, but I think it will have a negative effect on my international career. It's something I'll have to live with," said Priestland.Priestland came off the bench to earn Scarlets a last-gasp win away against bottom-side Zebre in the Pro12 on Saturday with the final kick of the match.He says leaving the region will be difficult, particularly seeing former outside-half rival Stephen Jones returning to Parc y Scarlets as attack coach next season."I'm not going to lie, I would have loved to have worked with Steve [Stephen Jones]," said Priestland."I think he's a very knowledgeable man, especially about rugby and he's a great guy as well."It was a shame when I found out he was coming back, but I'd already made my decision and I've just got to stick with that."Priestland believes former Wales and British Lions fly-half Jones is the right man to take over from Mark Jones."I'm sure Steve will do a great job with the Scarlets," he said."There's a lot of quality players down there and I'm sure he's the right man to sort of mould them and get the team playing they way I know that they can potentially."Hopefully Steve has a lot of success as a coach as he did as a player down there."
An Arizona judge sentenced former waitress Jodi Arias to life in prison with no possibility of parole on Monday for shooting and stabbing her ex-boyfriend to death in 2008.Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Sherry Stephens said Arias' crime, which attracted national attention, was "especially cruel ... (and) involved substantial planning and preparation."Arias, 34, had escaped a possible death sentence last month after a lone juror at her sentencing retrial refused to back the death penalty throughout five days of deliberations.Prosecutors say she killed her former partner in a jealous rage while Arias argues she acted in self-defense.After a second jury failed last month to reach a unanimous verdict on whether she should be executed, Stephens had to choose between sentencing her either to life in prison or to life with the possibility of parole after 25 years."The defendant did not render aid to the victim ... (and) destroyed evidence at the crime scene," Stephens said in issuing the sentence."The court finds the mitigation presented is not sufficiently substantial to call for leniency and that a natural life sentence is appropriate."Stephens declared a mistrial on March 5 after a female juror refused to vote for the death penalty.The victim, 30-year-old Travis Alexander, was found dead in a shower at his Phoenix-area home in June 2008. He had been stabbed more than 20 times, his throat was slashed almost from ear to ear, and he had been shot in the face.
CLEVELAND - A three-year-old fatally shot a one-year-old at a Cleveland house during the weekend, according to police, who said they are seeking to arrest the adult who left the gun in the home.The one-year-old, identified as Braylon Robinson, was shot in the face on Sunday, police said on Monday."The mother was in the room with the children facing away from them when she heard a single gunshot. The mother then observed the victim lying on the floor bleeding," according to statement released by Cleveland police.Police said the gun was left in a home where several children were playing. No arrests were made as of Monday morning.Two other children, relatives of the one-year-old, who were in the house at the time of the shooting did not sustain any injuries and were released to their mother."A three-year-old can't be held accountable for a tragedy like this," Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said at news conference. "People will be held accountable for this tragedy."
WATERLOO REGION – Waterloo Catholic District School Board is looking for a new leader, after being without an education director for nearly a year.The school board has officially launched a search to replace Larry Clifford, whose two-year contract was not renewed at the end of this past July. The Catholic board retained Promeus executive search firm to help find candidates for the board’s top position, with resumes required by May 15.Successful candidates must be practising Catholics who have shown commitment to the mission and Catholic education.The board hired Michael Schmitt, a longtime administrator and educator with the school district, to serve as an interim education director, and opted to wait to launch the formal search until after last fall’s municipal election.
US Democrats have their 2016 presidential frontrunner in Hillary Clinton, but the Republican field remains wide open - and it got even wider, with first-term Senator Marco Rubio joining the race.Rubio - a Florida MP and son of immigrants from Cuba who is equally at ease discussing foreign policy, deficit reduction, his family's compelling narrative or hip-hop music - is scheduled to make a "huge announcement" in Miami on Monday evening.But hours before he is expected to officially launch his campaign and cast himself as the next-generation candidate, in contrast with Clinton and mentor-turned-rival Jeb Bush, the 43-year-old Rubio told major donors on a conference call that he is in, the Miami Herald reported.He joins two other Republican first-term senators who are already running: Ted Cruz of Texas, who like Rubio is Cuban-American, and libertarian-leaning Rand Paul from Kentucky.While Clinton has few serious challengers from within her party - Vice President Joe Biden and former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley have expressed interest but little else - several more Republicans are considering jumping into the fray, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker and former Texas governor Rick Perry.Should Bush, the son and brother of two former presidents, enter the race as expected, his duel against fellow Floridian Rubio could be one of the more compelling narratives of the 2016 campaign.Rubio, who often casts his personal arc as the embodiment of the "American Dream", wants to take voters beyond the dynastic Bush-Clinton dynamic that has ruled US politics for much of the last quarter century.He and his team have telegraphed some of Rubio's themes for the Monday night event in Miami, notably that he is the candidate for a "new American century".Youthful, charismatic, and articulate on several issues, Rubio hopes to transcend the Republican Party's reputation for difficulty in connecting with young, Hispanic or African-American voters.
Rabat – Morocco is one of the most religious countries in the world, according to a new study.A new study by leading pollster Win/Gallup International surveyed a sample of more than 63,000 people from 65 countries about religion. The study has ranked Morocco among the most religious countries in the world with 93 per cent of Moroccans identify themselves as religious compared to only 4 per cent who said they were not religious. An even smaller percentage of Moroccans said they are convinced atheists – 1 per cent.To produce these results, the Win/Gallup survey used polling techniques such as face-to-face, on the phone or online conversations with respondents. According to the study, the most religious country in the world is Thailand, where 94 per cent belong to a religion, while just 1 per cent of the Thai people identify themselves as atheists.Many countries across Africa and the Middle East were not included in this study. Countries like Saudi Arabia, where the majority of people are usually expected to identify themselves as religious, were not surveyed.The study has also found that China is by far the country that harbors the largest number of people who identify themselves as atheists. The country with a population exceeding a billion has twice as many atheists as believers. It is followed by Japan as the second least religious country in the world. Western Europe and Oceania are significantly less religious in comparison to Africa, the Americas, Asia and Eastern Europe.Jean-Marc Leger, president of WIN/Gallup International Association, said that organized religion continues its worldwide scale dominance.“[W]e see that the total number of people who consider themselves to be religious is actually relatively high, Leger said, according to the Telegraph.“Furthermore, with the trend of an increasingly religious youth globally, we can assume that the number of people who consider themselves religious will only continue to increase.”In Europe, the United Kingdom is among the less religious countries, with 54 per cent of the population is not religious, compared to 30 per cent who said they are and 13 per cent who are convinced atheists. In the U.S, 56 per cent of respondents said they are religious, while 33 per cent claimed they were not, and 6 per cent identified themselves as atheists.Also among the findings is that older people are less religious than younger people. The study has found that people in their early twenties are most likely to embrace a religion, while people aged between the age of 44-54 are the least likely to do the same.Housewives are most likely to be religious, followed by retirees and then students. Wealthier people with more education tend to be less religious, the study says.Four out of five people without education identify as religious, while the number stands at only 3 out of five of those who received higher education.Join the Conversation.

Over the next few months the busy building site, which has left a glaring gap in part of the shopping parade, should be dominated by cranes putting together the new building.It will house a flagship Primark, four other retailers, restaurants and the nine-screen picture house – following on from the relocation of the market, stores opening and upgrade of the street’s appearance.For Ranald Philips, development manager for investors on The Moor, it has been one of the biggest challenges of a 40-year career.He said: “People should see progress on phase two in the next couple of months – the work being focused on now is not very interesting for the general public to look at, they’ve already done a lot of work on the foundations for Primark for example.“I think it will probably be a couple of months and we will see the cranes arrive on site.“This has been the most challenging project I have worked on, because it has a number of developments each with their own challenges rather than just being a single project.“We’ve had to bring it all together as a combination of regeneration and redeveloping while tying it in with the council’s aspirations – the relationship with the council has been crucial to what we are trying to achieve.”Some shoppers have criticised phase one of The Moor’s regeneration as simply moving Castlegate to a new location, with new stores near the £18m market including TJ Hughes, Poundland, Iceland and toy store The Entertainer.For most people it is not enough to prevent them from going to Meadowhall shopping centre instead.Ranald said the vast majority of retail property in the city had been in the same hands for years – with developer Hammerson holding much before the company failed to deliver the £400 million Sevenstone retail quarter scheme.Now the council proposes to purchase properties in the area between Pinstone Street, Moorhead and Barker’s Pool and seek a development partner for a different, long-awaited scheme.Ranald, a director of specialist firm Ashcroft, added: “Retailers, understandably perhaps, were uncertain as to what was going to happen – they simply haven’t had the environment to move into. This is the first time the quality of offer they are interested in is being created.“Fargate is very restricted in terms of shop size, the retail units in Meadowhall have got the space to offer the full range of goods.“They’ve always said the new retail quarter will be targeting the more aspirational premium brands. Sheffield is unique in this country as it is the only major city which, apart from John Lewis, has no aspirational retailers.“You maybe could include Fatface and Schuh on the list – but there’s no Ted Baker, Reiss, Jigsaw, names that every other city has a selection of. All those brands are represented in part in other cities, Sheffield is completely devoid of them. They just haven’t been given the environment.”But The Moor will not be home to those luxury brands, if they materialise.Hopes are pinned on it becoming a ‘destination’ with regular events, as well as returning the street to its glory days of a major high street mecca and boosting Sheffield’s night-time economy. The former Woolworths is being used by theatre company Theatre Delicatessen as a daytime arts cafe and for evening performances, festivals and debates.Ranald added: “As far as the Moor is concerned our ambition is to have a very strong high street because this is not the environment for those premium brands.“The Moor used to be one of Sheffield’s strongest retail sites, with Marks and Spencer, places like Woolworths, it had four department stores. We want to take it back to that with department stores, Primark, TJ Hughes and more mainstream fashion brands.“The Moor especially just dies at 5.30pm and in today’s climate that is just not acceptable. Retailers thrive off a strong cultural offer, restaurants want to be where the shops are – we hope it will be as vibrant an evening destination as it will be a daytime one.“The restaurants and the cinema will open until 11pm or 12pm most nights. I would love to see the shops also opening later but we have got to have the infrastructure in place first.”
London calling: Could Kovacic be set for a move to the Emirates?Here are all the latest Gunners stories from today's Daily Mirror...Arsene Wenger has revealed he does not like to dish out the hairdryer treatment to his players after matches.While the verbal blasts of Sir Alex Ferguson were legendary at Manchester United, his Arsenal counterpart insists hammering players is not the right way to go.He said: “I don’t like to shout at players after a game because you can do too much damage after the match. It is true that sometimes it is very tempting though.“But sometimes I’ve gone overboard after games, so most of the time I really try to control myself because I go red in the face and think to myself: ‘The damage is big, don’t do more.’Arsenal star Mesut Ozil was spotted partying with friends - just hours after missing Saturday’s 2-1 win at Newcastle United due to illness.The midfielder, 26, was omitted from Arsene Wenger’s squad for the trip to St James’ Park as Olivier Giroud’s double earned them the points.However, Ozil was seen out at The Pearl nightclub in Berlin the same evening.Arsenal are likely to remind the German international about his responsibilities, as they did with Wojciech Szczesny after his smoking storm earlier this year.Did you know we have an Arsenal page on Facebook?Arsenal are reportedly set to make an offer to sign Inter Milan midfielder Mateo Kovacic, according to the Metro.The Gunners were strongly linked with Kovacic last week amid claims that Inter are ready to sell the Croatian international.Manchester United and Chelsea are also keen, but reports in Spain say Arsenal are set to launch a bid to try and get the pass-master signed up.Arsenal will create space for a new central midfielder by dumping Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby this summer. Kovaci is rated at £17.7million.Also in the Metro, Arsenal have moved a step closer to signing Hakan Calhanoglu with the midfielder apparently stalling on a new contract with Bayer Leverkusen.Calhanoglu has emerged as one of Arsenal’s major targets ahead of the summer transfer window, with Arsene Wenger said to been following him for two years.Leverkusen are keen to keep hold of their star asset, but reports say Arsenal have been handed a boost with 21-year-old stalling on signing a new contract at the club.The Gunners had recently considered swapping on-loan forward Podolski for Calhanoglu, but it’s now thought they’re looking for a straight cash deal.
Blunder: The woman was alive and well in Sao Jose dos Campos Municipal HospitalA heartbroken family who gathered for the funeral of an elderly relative were stunned to discover their loved one was alive and well - and they were burying an unknown woman.Grieving relatives were devastated last week after being told their beloved mother had passed away after suffering a stroke, just days after being admitted to hospital.The children of Maria Aparecida da Silva, from Sao Jose dos Campso, near Sao Paolo, immediately began arranging their mum's funeral and splashed out on undertakers and getting a tombstone engraved.But when Maria's children turned early for the funeral on Sunday they found another woman in the coffin and then rushed back to hospital to find their bemused mother happily chatting away with other patients.Flavio Correia da Silva, 51, one of her sons, said: "When we arrived at the funeral, as soon as we opened the coffin we knew a big mistake had been made. We all came back to the hospital and saw that she was just fine. She was even asking why we hadn't visited her for so long."Another medical team said sorry for the mix-up, which is difficult to accept. It had been very traumatic for us, we even had to break the news to family then travelled long distances to be here."Someone needs to be punished, this type of mistake shouldn't happen.”Bosses at the Municipal Hospital admitted that Maria's name had mistakenly been included on the death certificate of another patient who had died while undergoing cancer surgery.The two women had been staying in the same hospital ward and, according to doctors, were of similar looks and age.Flavio said they were so shocked at the news that they did not question the fact that Maria had died while undergoing surgery to remove a tumour, even though she was in hospital after suffering a stroke.He said the siblings started planning their mother's funeral service and immediately paid £200 to get her gravestone engraved.He said the family had reported the case to the police, but added that they have deliberately not told their mother, who remains entirely unaware of the drama.Carlos Maganha, director of the Sao Jose dos Campos Municipal Hospital yesterday said an internal inquiry had been opened into the blunder.He said: "All the people involved will be heard to clear up what happened so that, from this, it will be possible to identify the faults made.A spokesman for the town's health department said that those found responsible for the error will be punished "because of the inconvenience this has caused the family."
Russia has unveiled designs for a new enormous military transport aircraft that could carry seven tanks (or up to 200 tons) on board at supersonic speeds of over 1,200 miles per hour to places up to 4,000 miles away.Those sorts of speeds are never achieved by bulky transporter craft - America's largest military transport plane has a top speed of 518 miles per hour, for example - so quite how Russia plans to achieve them remains to be seen.The PAK TA aircraft has a the sort of sleek design we’re more used to seeing on stealth jets, but it’s much larger.It’s currently only at the concept stage, but Russia’s Military-Industrial Commission wants a fleet of 80 of the planes ready for service by 2024.The idea is that the whole fleet could lift 400 tanks to anywhere in the world in record time.However, aviation experts have poured cold water on the idea - saying that the weight and size of the aircraft would require extremely large purpose-built runways and would need a ludicrous amount of fuel. Plus its enormous wingspan would make it an easy target for enemies.Furthermore, the plans for PAK TA to be a hybrid electric aircraft are particularly unlikely. The technology for supersonic electric planes simply isn't ready yet.The PAK TA is being developed by aviation company Ilyushin.
Players of Liverpool on the pitch during the Barclays Premier League match bewteen Liverpool and Manchester Untied at Anfield on March 22, 2015 in Liverpool, England. (Photo by Andrew Powell/Liverpool FC via Getty Images)It was all set up for a classic, wasn't it?The atmosphere inside Anfield was brilliant, there was an emotional 'You'll Never Walk Alone' before kick, and we all expected Liverpool to tear into Manchester United from the first whistle.And then the game kicked off, and everything changed.The passion from the stands simply didn't filter down onto the pitch.The first half was just a nothing game, a nothing performance from Liverpool.We stood off them, we sat back and we allowed them to dictate. We should have been in their faces from the off, we should have been pushing them back, snapping at their heels and imposing ourselves, but we didn't.Tactically, we got it wrong. We should have had someone, whether it was Philippe Coutinho or Adam Lallana, sitting on Michael Carrick, denying him space and dragging him out of position.We saw against Spurs last week that Carrick can dominate games when he's allowed to, and I was amazed we made it so easy for him again.It was all so frustrating, and so unexpected. We didn't have a corner in the first 45 minutes, and barely registered a shot at goal. David De Gea, overworked at Old Trafford, had virtually nothing to do this time.We could pick out moments, and decisions that ultimately cost us, but the fact is that our performance in that first half wasn't good enough. Martin Atkinson might have had a terrible game, but this was one where the referee had no bearing on the result.Daniel Sturridge and Mario Balotelli of Liverpool in action during the Barclays Premier League match between Liverpool and Manchester UnitedWe were better with 10 men than we were with 11, closing down more and putting them under more pressure all over the pitch. We at least we made a fight of it in the second half, but it was always going to be hard to turn it round. We just ran out of legs towards the end.The real frustration is that, and this isn't sour grapes, I still feel United are little more than ordinary. What they are, however, is exceptionally well-drilled and regimented.They're not the flamboyant United of years gone by, despite all the money they've spent on supposedly top players, but they're organised and disciplined under Louis Van Gaal, and they took advantage of Liverpool's flat performance.Why Liverpool were short of passion in such a big game, I'm not sure, and I think Brendan Rodgers was surprised by it too. But it cost his side. By the time they started competing with United, it was already too late.Liverpool FC v Manchester United Premier League Match at Anfield Stadium Liverpool. Gerrard sent off for this challengeWhat can I say about Steven Gerrard 's red card?Well, firstly, that it was entirely deserved. Maybe in my day you'd get away with leaving your foot in like that – I know a few players who did, on more than one occasion! - but you simply can't do it now. It was a cast-iron red card.I actually thought Steven could have been a little cuter in that incident. Ander Herrera had flown into a tackle and not got near the ball. I think Stevie could have left his leg there, taken a little hit and maybe got the United man sent off himself.Instead, he produced a moment of madness, which has cost both him and his side. He will have been devastated walking off that pitch, and watching the second half from the dressing room.Steven Gerrard of Liverpool leaves the pitch after being shown the red cardJamie Carragher was right; Stevie will have watched that first half, and watched Mata and Herrera strolling round, and thought 'I'm not having that'. His first tackle on Mata was a beauty, and was more than Liverpool had managed in 45 minutes beforehand. But he made a mistake thereafter, and paid the price.He knows he let himself down, and let the fans down too. But if any Liverpool player has enough credit in the bank to be forgiven for a mistake, it is Steven. Anyone criticising him for a red card should remember how much he has done for the club over the years.He'll have to watch on for the next three games now, but I just hope the final month or so of his career can give him the finale he deserves.Liverpool FC v Manchester United Premier League Match at Anfield Stadium Liverpool. Raheem Sterling gets a cross into the boxI hope and I pray that Raheem Sterling sees sense over his contract situation at Liverpool.And I hope he, or someone close to him, has a word with his agent, because he is doing the kid no favours.It seems that the situation is affecting Sterling's form. He played yesterday like he had the weight of the world on his shoulders, and that is not good.Those closest to him need to spell it out for him. The best place for him to be is at Liverpool, who have looked after him so well over the last four or five years. Liverpool have developed him into this player. Both Sterling, and his agent, need to realise this. And quickly.Defeat on Sunday makes it a real hard slog now, if Liverpool are to finish in the top four this season.The gap to United is now effectively six points, factoring in goal difference. And with eight games remaining that's a big deficit.Basically, Liverpool need to win all their remaining games. Arsenal away is the next one, and that's a huge one. I'm sure Brendan and his players wish it was tomorrow, instead of a fortnight away. They'll be desperate to show a positive reaction after Sunday.They're capable of going to the Emirates and winning, though. They're capable of doing it.The trouble is, they have to now. Anything else, and we can forget about the Champions League.I felt a little for Daniel Sturridge in the first half on Sunday.Sure, he was quiet, and didn't have a very good game. But he was starved of service.There is a little problem brewing here, in that if you keep Coutinho quiet, you keep Liverpool quiet. United kept Coutinho quiet on Sunday, and Sturridge had nothing to work off.The one time in the first half where Liverpool got the ball to him in the box, he set up a chance for Lallana. And in the second half, the one chance we created for him, he took.He's just got to keep working hard up there, and things will turn around. But Liverpool have to find a way to make it easier for him, no doubt.
At least 52 dogs have died after being struck down by an horrific kidney disease, vets have warned.In the first recorded outbreak of Alabama rot to be reported in Britain, dogs have fallen ill and died up and down the country.Pet owners are warned to look out for lesions on their dogs' legs as vets continue to search for the cause of the disease.Outbreaks of Alabama rot, which attacks blood vessels in the skin and kidneys, have affected dogs in the US as long ago as the 1980s.But the disease was unknown in this country until November 2012, when reports started emerging of dogs dying mysteriously in the New Forest, Hampshire.The results of an investigation into the outbreak, published last night in the journal Veterinary Record, reveal the full horror of the disease.Although the initial cases were reported in Hampshire, incidents have since been confirmed across England and Wales, from Somerset in the South West to County Durham in the North East.Unlike the US cases, which have only affected greyhounds, the British outbreak has caused problems to a wide variety of different breeds.It has affected English springer spaniels, flat coated retrievers, whippets, Labradors - dogs of all shapes and sizes from a cocker spaniel to a Doberman.There have been 103 suspected incidents reported by vets, lead researcher David Walker told the Daily Mail last night, although only 52 of those have been confirmed by postmortem examinations.All those dogs died - either killed by the disease or put down by their vets.Mr Walker, a vet who practises in Hampshire, said the team's investigation had not established why the disease had so suddenly sprung up, how it had arrived in Britain, or why certain dogs had been affected.But he warned pet owners to remain alert to symptoms.'The main message is that we are still seeing cases spring up. Although the numbers are relatively small, continued vigilance is the best thing. People should look out for skin lesions when the dog hasn't obviously been cut on something.'He admitted much remains unknown about the problem.'We don't know whether this is a condition that has been in the UK for a while, but just was unrecognised, or whether it had recently emerged,' he said.One of the many dogs struck down the disease was Tegan, a three-year-old fox terrier cross, who died in February 2014 after walking near Ashurst in the New Forest.Her owner Sarah Thairs, of North Baddesley, Hampshire, took her to the vet but her condition worsened and Tegan died soon afterwards.She said at the time: 'My poor little girl had been through so much.'Tests showed the disease had gone to her pancreas. I had to make the decision to put her down, which is heartbreaking.'The investigation found no obvious link between any of the dogs - even those who became ill within a few days in the New Forest.Mr Walker said: 'When we looked at all their walking routes and other factors, we could find nothing in common.'The results rule out early theories that the dogs had been poisoned by contaminated food.They also ruled out a link to the E.coli shiga toxin, another early theory.The scientists are still investigating whether the disease was caused by environmental factors such as a bacteria or virus, or whether the problem was genetic.They are comparing it to a similar human disease of the kidneys, called Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome, which is genetic but can be caused by exposure to certain medications, to see whether it can offer any clues.
It’s a classic Easter meal loved by families around the world: a juicy lamb joint served with rosemary, roast potatoes, carrots and sprouts.But one London restaurant is giving the traditional roast a twist this spring, serving the entire spread deep-fried.In fact, everything on this menu is doused in batter and then fried, from buttered crumpets and cheese strings to Tunnock’s tea cakes, hot cross buns and even a whole pizza.London’s latest pop-up restaurant #FryHard in Boxpark, Shoreditch will be serving more than 100 different deep-fried foods during the long Easter weekend (2 to 5 April).The calorific eaterie is the brainchild of Messhead, a collaboration between chef Jim Thomlinson’s London Mess and freelance creative director Emma Thomas, better known as Miss Cakehead.Miss Cakehead told FEMAIL: We will be serving deep fried quiche Lorraine, pasties, pork pies, Scotch egg, frankfurters and burgers.'The pair will also offer fried desserts alongside their savoury items, with doughnuts, cakes and even coconut ices all getting the deep-fried treatment.‘We are handmaking most things, ‘ she continued, ‘and people are going to bring along stuff for us to fry and we don’t know what people will bring.‘It has got to be edible and the final decision [whether they should be deep-fried] comes from Jim. ‘The fully fried Easter feast will serve six people and has to be booked in advance.‘We had this idea at Christmas as Die Hard is my favourite Christmas movie,’ Miss Cakehead continued.‘Messhead loves a good pun - it's great to see other Die Hard fans get the 'Now I Have A Deep Fat Fryer' reference in the images by Travis Hodges.’She did however admit that the idea is a trifle silly.She said: ‘Jim is about to launch his street food concept Prawnography at Old Street Roudabout - part of Burger Bear HQ - so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins.‘We also tried deep fried chocolate at Jim's previous pop up The Dead Horse Society - once I tasted it for the first time I knew I had to revisit!'But while the venture has been greeted with interest the pair have no plans to make it into a more permanent thing.'It is just for Easter - after which Jim will continue with Prawnogrpahy and I will continue on goodness knows what alongside,’ Miss Cakehead continued.‘The response has been amazing though one dentist on Twitter said we were "disgusting".‘So many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried Babybel getting the strongest response so far.'
Stockbroker and investment bank Panmure Gordon has reported better profits and income, and its first final dividend since 2007.The group, which has a Liverpool operation in Chapel Street, announced annual figures for the year to December 31 that showed a 7.6% increase in net commission and fee income to £29.3m, and an 84% rise in pre-tax profits of £2.15m.It also declared a debt-free balance sheet and a 2.5p dividend per share.Throughout the year the group helped raise more than £800m for its corporate clients.Chief executive Phillip Wale said: “We are delighted that the business is consolidating its strong position for growth following a successful turnaround period.“Despite difficult markets in the second half of the year revenue growth has been encouraging.“The return to paying a dividend for the first time since 2007, the onset of the financial crisis, is a clear sign that the strategy executed over the recent years is successful.“We remain firmly focused on serving our corporate and institutional clients and aligning our resources to profitable opportunities.“Since the start of 2015, we have gained further corporate client appointments, won further transaction mandates and executed four significant fund raises already.“We are optimistic that recent improved activity will continue and are pleased to be working on a healthy pipeline of engagements.“While difficult to forecast, equity capital markets are expected to remain receptive to high quality, sensibly priced transactions.”He added: “With the support of our major shareholder, QInvest, Panmure Gordon is well-positioned to build on the achievements of 2014 and create meaningful upside for shareholders.”The group exited its US investment banking operation in 2012 to focus on its UK operations. By the year end it had 123 clients, compared with 130 the previous year.

Government sources argue there is no single reason for the increase in road deaths again last year. Photograph: Alan Betson/The Irish TimesRoad users are most likely to lose their lives in counties where the fewest penalty points have been issued, official figures indicate.An Irish Times analysis of road safety data shows motorists in Co Clare are the most likely to have been issued with penalty points for traffic offences.Almost one in four drivers in the county have received points. The figures are nearly as high for commuter-belt counties such as Wicklow, Kildare and Meath. Longford and Roscommon also have a high proportion of penalised motorists.By contrast, Donegal, had the lowest proportion of drivers with penalty points, almost half the rate recorded in Clare. Other counties with low rates include Monaghan, Kerry and Mayo.The proportion of road deaths was significantly higher for counties with low numbers of penalty points. Monaghan has the most dangerous roads in the State, with 13 deaths per 100,000 people. Kerry and Donegal also have low penalty points, but their roads are more dangerous than most, with between eight and nine deaths per 100,000 population.Speeding is by far the most common cause of penalty points, accounting for about three-quarters of all road traffic offences. The Road Safety Authority was unable to comment on the figures last night.Conor Faughnan of AA Roadwatch said he believes the trends have much to do with the influence of road traffic enforcement, while road safety group Parc believes a fall-off in Garda enforcement is the main reason for the increase in fatalities.Road deaths rose again last year. Government sources argue there is no single reason for the increase. They point to an overall increase in traffic as the economy recovers and increases in deaths of so-called vulnerable road users, such as cyclists, pedestrians and motorcyclists.About 400,000 drivers have penalty points at any one time. About 200 drivers are off the road, having accumulated 12 points each. A further 22 drivers have been prosecuted for driving against the flow of traffic on a motorway.
Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said he wants to see the Portlaoise hospital report published but added two organisations using public money should not be in “court situations”.Taoiseach Enda Kenny has said he wants to see the Portlaoise hospital report published but added two organisations using public money should not be in “court situations”.He said Minister for Health Leo Varadkar was correct to say he expected the HSE and Hiqa to sort out their differences without resorting to the law.“I hope now that the processes he has put in place will result in differences being ironed out and the report being published,” Mr Kenny said.He was speaking on his way into Cabinet on Tuesday morning.The controversial draft report into baby deaths at Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoisel makes more than 250 “adverse findings or inferences” affecting senior figures in the Health Service Executive, the Department of Health and the State Claims Agency.It includes serious findings against medical staff involved in the care of 83 women at Midland Regional Hospitalin Portlaoise who provided information to the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa), the HSE has claimed in correspondence seen by The Irish Times.At least six separate findings imply a “reckless endangerment” of patients, according to HSE director general Tony O’Brien.Mr O’Brien, in a series of strongly worded letters to the authority, describes the women’s accounts as “unverified” and claims the draft report lacks accuracy and balance.The dispute between the two State agencies, revealed in The Irish Times yesterday, has prompted Opposition calls for the immediate publication of the report.Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said he expected the HSE and Hiqa to sort out their differences without resorting to the law but added it would be “totally inappropriate and irresponsible” to publish a report in draft form.The document places much of the blame for Portlaoise’s problems on the HSE by citing passivity among HSE managers, constant changes in corporate structures and a lack of clear reporting roles as contributory factors.However, Mr O’Brien accuses it of a “lack of accuracy, context, specificity and balance” and says it includes superfluous comments which are likely to cause needless distress.According to Mr O’Brien, it is not within the statutory functions of the authority to make findings which would attribute blame, guilt or liability to anyone employed by the HSE.He says the HSE accepts there were “shortcomings” at the hospital but “nowhere in the report is there any evidence of a recognition of the extreme financial restrictions that encumbered and obstructed the HSE’s ability to implement improvements”.In a letter to Hiqa chief executive Phelim Quinn on March 13th, Mr O’Brien says he is left with no option but to take “an extraordinary step” and retain counsel to bring High Court proceedings to stop the authority publishing the report until affected parties have been afforded their rights to fair procedures.Following a meeting between HSE and department officials last Thursday, Hiqa agreed to provide the HSE with more information on the findings in the draft report and the HSE withdrew the immediate threat of legal action. This will delay publication until next month at the earliest.
IRN-BRU maker AG Barr has reported record annual profits but warns continued price deflation will make it difficult to maintain top line growth.The Cumbernauld-based company said pre-tax profits for the 2015 year to January 25 rose 10 per cent to £41.9 million as sales rose 2.7 per cent to £260.9 million.Barr said stripping out the impact of lost Orangina revenue, a contract it exited early from with Lucozade Ribena Suntory Group, year on year sales increased 3.3 per cent.Barr has also booked £3.3 million in exceptional items for the 2015 year, the bulk of which relates to reorganisation costs and asset impairment charges from closing its Tredegar site and moving carton production to its new facilities in Milton Keynes.On a comparative basis, including exceptional items, pre-tax profits were up 12.8 per cent to £38.6 million (2014: £34.2 million).Barr had booked £3.8 million in exceptional items in the 2014 year.Total IRN-BRU sales rose 1.6 per cent, having benefited from the “successful sponsorship of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games”, where Barr had directed “much of its brand activity, promotion and consumer communication”.The group said it sold “just under £1million of IRN-BRU ice cream in the year, and IRN-BRU sales in England and Wales rose 5.6 per cent in the year, and sugar-free IRN-BRU sales rose 20 per cent in this market.The group said sales in England and Wales, which now account for almost 60 per cent of Barr's total revenues, grew by 3.5 percent and international sales rose 7.9 per cent.Barr said while its position in Scotland “remains extremely strong”, with sales up 1.2 per cent year-on-year, “significant future growth potential lies in the 'rest of the UK' and increasingly in the high potential international segment of our business”.The group announced on Monday it has agreed a seven-figure football sponsorship deal in England, becoming the official soft drinks partner to the English Championship, League One and League Two.Barr said its still drinks brands delivered a particularly strong performance with growth of 5.7 per cent, which was driven by “over 20 per cent growth in the Strathmore brand and Snapple which, although relatively small in total revenue terms, grew by 35 per cent”.In carbonates, performance was “robust” and growth was “well ahead of the market” in IRN-BRU Sugar Free, Rubicon and Barr, though its Rockstar energy drink “grew more in line with the energy market at 5.2 per cent, following the very significant growth of 60 per cent in the prior year”.Barr said a new 10-year exclusive deal agreed last year with US soft drinks giant Dr Pepper Snapple Group, “represents an opportunity to drive profitable growth across a number of markets”.Barr said the Snapple deal, to sell, market and distribute the Snapple brand in the UK some EU territories, combined with its existing portfolio of brands focussed outside the UK, provides “exciting opportunities for new growth”.The company also notes its acquisition of cocktail mixer maker Funkin Ltd post year-end, in a deal worth up to £21 million, “is a small but significant step into a new, high growth sub-category of the drinks sector”.Barr added: “It also provides further incremental growth potential for the group, both in the UK and internationally, as well as the opportunity to enhance our position in the ontrade and hotel, restaurant and café hospitality market segments.”In January Barr had reported sales had “slowed” in the third quarter against a “strong” first half, though it added profit performance was not affected by its decision in the second half, “not to participate in some of the more aggressive price promotion”.However the group warns the UK soft drinks market entered “a deflationary phase towards the end of the year”.Barr said overall the soft drinks market “remains challenging”, and warns continued price deflation make it more difficult to maintain top line growth.The group is proposing a final dividend of 9.01 pence per share, taking the total dividend for the year to 12.12 pence, up 10 per cent on the previous year.Commenting on the results, Barr chief executive, Roger White, said: “We have delivered an excellent financial performance in difficult market conditions over the past 12 months, whilst continuing to build the platform required for sustained and profitable long-term growth.“Looking forward we will continue our approach of tight cost control, rigorous cash management and focus on execution whilst continuing to invest for the long-term in our brands, assets and people.“The U.K. soft drinks market is currently experiencing a period of price deflation which will, if sustained, make it more difficult for many businesses to deliver the top line growth of recent years.“Whilst our year has started slowly, reflecting tough comparative trading and promotional phasing, we are confident that our management actions, combined with our proven business model, will enable us to further unlock the significant potential that AG Barr offers its shareholders this year and into the future.”Shares in AG Barr were down 2.2 per cent in early trading on Tuesday.
Encouraging more women into engineering and science-related roles is key to tackling the widening skills gap within Scotland’s energy sector.Skills Development Scotland (SDS) has published a revised action plan in a bid to ensure a viable talent pool is available to energy operators in future.The SDS document outlines several measures, including exporting more flexible work practices to encourage more female trainees, to put the brakes on the skills drain.Other actions include improving promotion of Stem subjects within schools, increasing work experience and ensuring greater professional development and promotion opportunities for those who do find jobs.The blueprint also calls for a greater focus on Modern Apprenticeships (MAs) as a way for young people to carve out a career.The publication coincided with the third meeting yesterday of the Energy Jobs Taskforce, a body chaired by Scottish Enterprise chief executive Lena Wilson.Skills and Training secretary Roseanna Cunningham, who toured energy services firm Hydrasun’s Aviemore precision engineering site yesterday, said maintaining and growing the energy skills base in Scotland was “crucial”.“Recent months have shown that even the most significant industry requires support to protect jobs and investment,” she said.“While we welcome the overdue changes to the North Sea tax regime announced by the UK Government last week, for some it is too late and jobs have already been lost.“Improved skills are paramount to the next steps on oil and gas exploration with a number of new projects under consideration.“We know that the sector will continue to provide high quality career opportunities for the next generation of young Scots.“With the creation of Energy Skills Scotland, increased MAs and graduates in the sector and a variety of skills funds aimed at bringing more people into the sector we have come far.“Today’s report has been backed by industry, education and enterprise and pulls together a range of actions to ensure we can plan for a prosperous future.“We need greater awareness of career opportunities at a younger age, more energy MAs as part of our move towards 30,000 each year from 2020 and an end to the outdated idea that engineering and science is just for boys.”Neville Prentice of SDS said: “For a long time the sector has had to cope with skills shortages, with companies reporting recruitment difficulties in a number of key disciplines.“Taking the right action now will put the sector in a good position to face up to future challenges, and to capitalise as fully as possible on future opportunities.”Hydrasun chief operating officer Bob McAlpine said: “Our future growth strategy depends on being able to develop and retain a talented workforce with the appropriate mix of skills and expertise.“We see our future needs being met through a mix of training of new staff and development to the full potential of the existing personnel.”
Anyone who has ever stepped foot on a rugby field knows how quickly the heat of the moment will cloud your judgment. Jacques Potgieter is not the first player to say something he would later regret, nor will he be the last. It is also possible he was not even thinking of homosexuality when he used the word "faggot". It is something I see fairly commonly when playing for Sydney's gay and inclusive rugby team, the Convicts. I've seen opposition players hurl the word at my teammates and then come over to sincerely apologise immediately after the game.While the apology to our community wasn't immediate in this situation, it came surprisingly quickly.On Sunday afternoon at Allianz Stadium, Brumbies flanker David Pocock approached the referee to complain of the use of homophobic slurs by members of the NSW Waratahs. By Monday evening, Waratah Potgieter had admitted the offence and been fined $20,000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU).The whole process was over within 24 hours. The issue, which could have so easily been ignored or swept under the carpet, was handled firmly and unambiguously in line with the ARU's recently implemented inclusion policy. It was the behaviour of an organisation that knows what it stands for and is willing to do what it takes to see that vision realised.But not everyone is happy. In some circles, Potgieter's use of the word "faggot" falls under the umbrella of sledging; in others, "that's just rugby". Pocock has been told to spend more time on his game than on his profile, and to talk less and play more. There is a sense that "it's not a big deal", that we "should really just move on", or, as some commentators have put it, that it is a case of "political correctness gone mad".Let's forget, for a moment, that such commentators seem to be more upset by Pocock's objection to homophobia than by the homophobic slurs themselves. The fact that such views treat the issue as oversensitive political correctness shows just how normalised homophobic language is in sport. Indeed, Out on the Fields, an international study of nearly 10,000 participants, found that 80 per cent of Australian respondents had witnessed homophobia on the sporting field. Slurs such as "faggot" or "dyke" were the most common form.Potgieter's apology, made late on Monday afternoon, sheds some lights on this phenomenon."It was an offhand remark made without thought for the hurt it could cause to those around me," he said.The problem is that when Potgieter's adrenaline-fuelled brain sought an insult in the heat of the moment, a homophobic slur was the first to come to mind. A hateful term for a sexual identity was the word he chose as he searched for a way to belittle his opposition. On the sporting field, homophobia is the preferred mode of attack, because homophobic slurs link homosexuality with weakness and effeminacy.So when Pocock chose to speak to the referee in the 64th minute, with his team trailing by 10 points and his own comeback from injury to worry about, he was pressing back against a long history of normalised homophobia on the sporting field. It is a history that has consistently excluded lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Australians from the sporting community by causing them to fear bullying and discrimination, and by never allowing them to feel truly part of the team. In the middle of a professional rugby match, Pocock had the presence of mind to recognise the potential damage caused if that history of homophobia were to be given voice by a televised NSW Waratah."You heard that, sir ... you can't say that; there could be gay players out there," Pocock said to referee Craig Joubert.He is right. Most young gay men playing team sports keep their sexuality secret. Imagine the effect it has on them to hear this kind of language.Pocock wasn't just talking about the LGBT kids watching at home; he was also talking about adult gay players, including professionals competing in Super Rugby today. Think of the great Welsh fullback Gareth Thomas, who came out in 2009, two years after playing his 100th and final international test for Wales. Most professional gay athletes do not come out until they retire. With language such as that used by Jacques Potgieter, it is not hard to see why.Alistair Kitchen plays for Australia's first gay and inclusive rugby team, the Sydney Convicts and is a co-author of the Out on the Fields report. It is the largest study on homophobia in sport, initiated by organisers of last year's Sydney Bingham Cup tournament.
When the Bulldogs last gathered in Crown's Palladium Room, to award the Charles Sutton Medal in  September, president Peter Gordon implored all to "embrace the struggle". Not even the biggest doomsayer among the faithful could have imagined what lay ahead.The Dogs finally put an off-season of unfathomable upheaval behind them on Tuesday night when Gordon launched the 2015 campaign before an audience that needed little encouragement to focus on the positives evident in last Saturday night's bright showing against Collingwood, and move on from the wreckage of the past six months.Tuesday night's upbeat occasion only underscored the travails of summer. The long-serving Gordon aside, everywhere there was evidence of change. There was no welcome for a chief executive because the club is yet to replace Simon Garlick, who resigned in January after five years in the job.Tom Liberatore had been a shy, almost embarrassed recipient of the best and fairest award  six months ago. His presence in the room on Tuesday was a morbid reminder that the Dogs' first steps down a hard road will be taken without their most important player, who will miss the season after a knee injury suffered in the first practice game.Bob Murphy took the stage as the new captain, not to accept the coach's award, as he had last September, from a mentor who five weeks later was forced out the door. Way back then, Brendan McCartney had introduced him as a player with "a deep, deep love of his teammates, and an even greater love of his club".The off-season was further test of the 32-year-old's commitment. Ryan Griffen's shock departure has at least ensured the Dogs now have a leader who embraces the job wholeheartedly and is comfortable with its myriad demands. "Leading the boys these past few months has been an absolute joy," Murphy said. "The boys and I just want to make our supporters proud."Murphy spoke on SEN radio on Tuesday of the sense of calm Luke Beveridge has brought to Whitten Oval, the subtle changes he has made in a mechanical and tactical sense, but also the cultural and spiritual shift the soulful skipper has noted since the new coach's arrival.Beveridge was the other notable newbie in the room on Tuesday night, and made it clear his enthusiasm for his first head coaching gig hasn't been diminished by the size of its attendant challenge.At September's season-ending function Gordon had implored his club to try harder and think smarter, so that 2015 could "be a year unlike any other". After the departures of McCartney, Griffen, Adam Cooney, Shaun Higgins and Liam Jones, among others, and the arrival of multimillion-dollar saviour Tom Boyd, that could indisputably be said of the off-season.Tuesday put a brave face on the task of making similar strides when the season proper begins.
A bitter row over Britain's FIFA vice-presidency has blown up with Wales accusing England of reneging over an agreement.Wales believe that England have gone back on a 2011 agreement by the four home nations which guaranteed their nominee to succeed Northern Ireland's Jim Boyce.Welsh FA president Trefor Lloyd Hughes said the Football Association had caused huge upset by entering David Gill for the position and that the controversy was "very embarrassing for them".Speaking in Vienna, he said: "I'm sorry to say the English FA have really, really upset me and upset the Welsh FA as well. And not just that, the people of Wales because they are up in arms about it. Not just the football fraternity but outside as well."The agreement was there. If you can't keep to an agreement... I think the English FA cannot believe in principles any more."I think it's very embarrassing for the English FA - very, very embarrassing."Gill, a Manchester United director and FA vice-chairman, is standing against Lloyd Hughes and is expected to easily win the seat on FIFA's executive committee, which for the first time is being voted for by all 54 UEFA members at the congress in Vienna.The agreement, signed by the previous FA chairman David Bernstein, says: "The order of rotation shall be IFA (2011-15) - FAW - SFA - FA - IFA etc in perennity."Real Madrid plan to take legal action against fans who attacked players' cars including that of Gareth BaleIt adds that any changes to the agreement require all four home nations to agree, saying: "Proposals to amend the foregoing terms require unanimity of vote to succeed."Gill claims the agreement became void after FIFA reforms which mean the British FIFA vice-presidency will be elected by all UEFA members instead of just the four home nations.UEFA's general secretary Gianni Infantino backed the FA's position saying at a news conference in Vienna that the FIFA reforms meant the agreement no longer stood.Infantino said: "We managed to convince FIFA to keep the British vice-presidency as we feel this is part of the history of football but the condition was that the election process should change so instead of it being the four British associations who decide it should be the UEFA Congress."So the conditions and situations have changed and the representative of the British associations will have a much greater legitimacy as he will be backed by the whole confederation."
Chelsea made things difficult for themselves at the KC Stadium against Hull on Sunday but are indebted to Loic Remy for securing maximum points when he scored the winner with his first touch.The match ended 3-2 but should never have been so close as far as the Blues’ performance was concerned. Goals in the second and ninth minutes from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa, respectively, took Chelsea 2-0 up and looking comfortable ahead a mad few minutes which saw the home side pull level.Matches are won and lost during important moments, and Branislav Ivanovic was particularly guilty as the initiative was handed over because of his poor defending in the build up to Ahmed Elmohamady’s goal and for his dodgy pass back to Thibaut Courtois’ wrong foot which led to a blunder, and a Hull equaliser as Abel Hernandez pounced on the mistake.Neither Courtois, Gary Cahill nor Filipe Luis cover themselves in glory for their performances but the former redeemed himself with a superb triple saves to keep the score level before Remy was introduced to score the winner. As a whole Chelsea’s performance showed a lot of character as they were rocked by being pegged back from 2-0 and in general they weren’t bad but certain individuals made things difficult for the team.Key players are letting the side down of late as Cahill’s poor season continues and both Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas aren’t controlling games from the middle of the park as they had over the first half of the season. Whilst it is difficult to rotate in central midfield due to the lack of options and John Obi Mikel’s injury but Jose Mourinho had attended to a defensive frailty when he dropped Cahill for Kurt Zouma, but the Frenchman has mostly operated in midfield since Cahill was reintroduced.Saying that, Chelsea were rewarded for the character they demonstrated in claiming the victory which took them six points clear at the top of the table with a game in hand. Remy’s winner also showed why he is deserving of more minutes on the pitch.
U.S. cyberspies swear they didn’t take down the Hermit Kingdom’s Internet after the Sony hack. And those spies weren’t the only ones rooting around Pyongyang’s servers.A variety of hackers—some working for the United States government, others operating independently—attacked and probed key portions of the North Korean Internet after the targeting of Sony Pictures Entertainment last year. Some of these hackers, including U.S. government employees, were acting in retaliation for the Sony attack; others, The Daily Beast has learned, were apparently driven by sheer curiosity about how the Hermit Kingdom’s fragile computer networks are connected to the outside world. And some of those independent actor claim that they are the ones who took North Korea offline.Sources with knowledge of the U.S. government cyber operations launched against North Korea tell The Daily Beast that they were designed to send a message that North Korean officials weren’t beyond the reach of the American government. That there would be consequences for cyber aggression that damaged American companies.These sources wouldn’t describe the operations in detail. But the sources insisted that the U.S. government did not cause North Korea’s Internet to crash, pointing to a dramatic collapse of the country’s few, fragile links to the outside world on December 22, 2014, three days after President Obama publicly fingered North Korea as responsible for the Sony intrusion. The Internet blackout led to speculation that the administration had ordered a cyber attack as part of what Obama said would be a “proportional” response to North Korea hacking Sony.These sources, however, note that the U.S. government activities appeared to be more limited and narrowly focused than actions taken by independent hackers and vigilantes, some of whom claim to have caused massive Internet outages in North Korea in response to the Sony intrusion.The U.S. may have contributed to some of an initial spate of attacks preceding the blackout, including ones that ressearchers say were aimed at North Korean government-operated sites and network infrastructure. The country also expeinrced a 24-hour period of network instability just prior to the blackout that was consisten with an outside cyber attack, according to an analysis by Dyn Research, which monitors global Internet connectivity.And yes, the U.S. government was launching cyber operations against North Korea during the period before the blackout, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence operations. But the takedown itself was not a U.S. government op.Precisely how North Korea’s Internet went down still hasn’t been fully explained, and publicly, Obama administration officials have neither confirmed nor denied that the government played a role. However, former U.S. intelligence officers who weren’t involved in the North Korean operation said the American government would hesitate to take down the country’s entire network because it would cut intelligence agencies off from the cyber spying they were doing inside North Korea.A senior U.S. intelligence official recently told The Daily Beast that spying on the country’s networks was mainly to gather information about North Korea’s nuclear weapons program and to get insights into the regime’s thinking. The National Security Agency considers North Korea a priority target and has a unit dedicated to covering it, former officials said. When the country’s Internet connections went down, there was no guarantee that the NSA would still be able to spy on all the same targets when it came back up, they said, another factor that would have argued against deliberately knocking out the country’s Internet access.There are a number of potential causes for the crash. One intriguing theory making the rounds among U.S. intelligence analysts is that North Korea inadvertently knocked itself offline during a frantic attempt to defend itself during the initial wave of attacks.But outside actors could have been at work. One group associated with the hacker collective Anonymous claimed credit for the outage on the day it occurred. And another group, calling itself Lizard Squad, which claims to have taken down Sony’s PlayStation network, also celebrated the downing of North Korea’s Internet. Experts have said it would be a relatively easy feat to take the entire country offline given that there are only four routes connecting North Korea to the global network.  Researchers tracked floods of traffic directed at North Korea at the time of the shutdown, pointing to a so-called denial of service attack.Online forums also show that hackers were probing the country’s networks to find out what devices were running on them and sharing information about where the weakness were. Also available on a popular hacker forum in the weeks after the attack: a tool that would allow an experienced practitioner to take over the customized operating system known as RedStar that is widely used in North Korea. One technical expert noted that by the time such exploits are submitted, they have usually been verified to work, and likely have been used.U.S. officials have been reluctant to confirm any activity by private hackers. But it would have been easy to spot their chatter. In a lengthy Reddit thread, commenters who were examining a serieis of remote probes and scans that mapped out some of North Korea’s network debated whether it would be illegal for American citizens to launch retaliatory strikes against the country. The group arrived at no consensus, but some commenters speculated that, under the circumstances, the United States government might look the other way if someone wanted to disable a North Korean Internet router.Last week, Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, said publicly that “there were some cyber responses to North Korea” following the Sony intrusion, but he didn’t specify whether they U.S. government was behind them or some other group. Asked by Bloomberg whether “the North Korea Internet outage was one of the responses,” McCaul reportedly said yes. McCaul’s spokesperson didn’t respond to several requests from The Daily Beast to clarify McCaul’s statement.CIA Director John Brennan was asked about the blackout on Fox News Sunday, and he too wouldn’t confirm any U.S. involvement. But he alluded to the relative ease of knocking North Korea offline.“There is an [Internet] infrastructure there that is rickety, there are challenges that they face on a technical front. So there are a lot of reasons why the North Korean people and the Internet system out there has problems,” Brennan said. Asked if the United States gave “a little shake to the rickety North Korean system,” Brennan replied that he would not “address anything that we may have done in that instance, and I’m not acknowledging anything at all there.”A spokesperson for the NSA referred questions about the blackout to the National Security Council, which declined to comment beyond what officials have already said.Regardless of who caused the blackout, it almost certainly alerted the North Korean regime to fundamental weaknesses in its cyber infrastructure. A security briefing compiled by Hewlett-Packard noted that a scan of North Korea’s networks in 2014 revealed “dated technology that is potentially susceptible to multiple vulnerabilities…” It wasn’t clear whether the regime had noticed the weaknesses, or had kept certain devices detectable to throw off spies or lure foreign government into hacking infected machines, known as honeypots, the report said.But given that North Korea’s Internet crashed again in late January of this year, the connections continue to look as rickety as U.S. officials say. And it seems Kim Jong Un can’t keep them up.
Heads in the sand will not aid crisis in mathsHeads in the sand will not aid crisis in mathsTHE next round of the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) will be conducted this year and it is pleasing to hear that our school pupils will be participating in the assessment.TIMSS is an in-depth international assessment of the teaching of mathematics and science. Grade eight pupils from around the world participate.In addition to measurement of maths and science competency, data are collected on parental education levels, learning environment conditions and the availability of textbooks, to name a few additional indicators. Following this, a comprehensive report is issued.SA fielded grade eight candidates in 1995 and fared the worst in the world. Our average score was 326 points; 500 is considered the minimum to reflect an acceptable degree of numeracy.SA participated again in 1999. Again, we scored the lowest in the world, with a dramatically decreased score of 275 points. We repeated the exercise in 2003. Once again, our grade eights performed the worst in the world, with an even lower score of 264 points.Then education minister Naledi Pandor declined participation in 2007. (In that year, Qatar was last, with a score of 307 points.)In 2011, SA participated again but had the efforts of grade nine candidates measured, while the rest of the world measured grade eights.The minister explained that the reason SA had grade nine pupils participate was "on the advice of TIMSS, considering that our grade eight national scores were too low to fit on the TIMSS international scale".In this round, SA performed third-worst in the world, ahead only of the Honduras and Ghana, both of which had entered grade eight candidates. We scored 352 points. SA was mentioned separately in the report because it had entered grade nine pupils.However, if the points score had been compared with the scores achieved by the rest of the world, SA would have been second-last, ahead only of Ghana — despite its pupils being two years older than the world average and one grade ahead.The self-congratulatory backslapping in which the minister has engaged over the four years since the 2011 report is highly disingenuous.This year, our grade nines will be aiming for a score of 340, according to the minister. Yet, in 2011, our grade nines achieved 352. So it seems that this time around we are targeting a drop in performance. How can this be?The minister also says grade five pupils will be part of the newly introduced numeracy study, which is designed for grade four pupils.The upshot is that our children’s ability will not be measured at a grade-appropriate level and cannot therefore be compared with the ability of children internationally.The extent of the crisis of quality education in our country needs to be known. We have to be honest about how bad we are.We certainly do not need to pretend that the situation is better than it is by manipulating a highly credible international study to suit the government’s political ends.One of the fundamental goals of TIMSS is to measure the "intended curriculum versus the implemented curriculum".In other words, it measures whether the curriculum, the plans and the strategies we put in place actually achieve the outcomes we desire. The answer, for SA, has been a categorical "no" for many years.The lack of urgency in this regard is astonishing.With every year that goes by with no effective action taken to remedy the very obvious shortcomings in the teaching of mathematics in most of our schools, hundreds of thousands of children are failed by the apathetic and ineffectual system.What we need most is a simple admission of failure and effective action to remedy our failure. No child deserves less.• Lovemore is the Democratic Alliance’s spokeswoman for basic education.
SUID-KAAP NUUS - Die 46 musiekkonserte by vanjaar se Absa KKNK, wat van 3 tot 11 April op Oudtshoorn plaasvind, sluit drie vertonings deur internasionale sterre in.Eerstens gaan Dana Winner, die bekende en geliefde Belgiese sangeres, op 6 April op die Musiekplaas optree as deel van haar toer vir die internasionale bekendstelling van haar nuutste album, Bloom. Sy vertel dat dit die eerste album is wat sy self vervaardig het en dat die liedjies daarop dus meer persoonlik as gewoonlik is omdat hulle spesiaal vir haar geskryf is. Benewens Belgies, Duits en Frans gaan sy ook drie liedjies in Afrikaans sing by dié konsert.Een van die drie is die pragtige Lied van hoop deur die bekende Suid-Afrikaanse liedjieskrywers Rudi Miller en Kobie Koen. Winner het tydens ’n onderhoud gesê, “Almal soek altyd na daardie klein vonkie hoop. Ons smag na wêreldvrede en hoop voortdurend daarop. Dit is waaroor dié liedjie gaan.”Winner, wat al 25 jaar in die bedryf is, noem van die liedjies “brose klein liedjies”, maar sê gehore kan ook uitsien na “groot” liedjies met meesleurende orkesbegeleiding. Daarom bring sy dié keer haar orkes saam Suid-Afrika toe.Nog twee sangers wat geen bekendstelling nodig het nie, is Mick Foster en Tony Allen, beter bekend as Foster & Allen. Hul buitelugkonsert op 7 April, ook op die Musiekplaas, maak deel uit van hul Gold & Silver Days-wêreldtoer. Sedert hul eerste groot treffer, Bunch of Thyme, in 1979 het dié Ierse duo meer as 800 liedjies en 29 albums opgeneem. Dit maak dit nie maklik om te besluit wat om tydens ’n konsert te sing nie, maar wees gerus, hulle gaan beslis van hul grootste treffers soos Maggie sing.Die derde groep is The Ruggeds, ’n opwindende span hip-hoppers en B-Boys van Nederland. Dié groep maak tans wêreldwyd opslae en het verlede jaar onder meer aan die freestyle-wêreldkampioenskappe in Los Angeles deelgeneem en is aangewys as die B-Boy Wêreldkampioene. Vyf van die lede gaan op 9 April saam met Afrikaanse rymkletsers in Rymklets optree en sal ook straatvertonings in Baron van Reedestraat lewer en werksessies aanbied.

A bit of sovereignty, if not quite an embarrassingly large chunk, was exchanged involuntarily for the use of foreign currencies on the local market. It was a relief to all.That surrender of some sovereignty was of course capitulation to some partly self-inflicted wounds, and to the sanctions that followed.In the process monetary policymaking capability was largely lost. It would be outsourced to the central bank of the anchor currency. It now comes all the way from the Federal Reserve Bank of the US to the embarrassment of all Pan-Africans and the South African Reserve Bank.The latter watches the toxic effects of a strengthening greenback on its northern neighbour’s economy with some justified anger and exasperation.Zimbabwe’s “chosen” anchor currency, the US dollar, has been, is and will strangle the crippled economy, unless urgent corrective action is taken. Even that may not be enough, unless a huge bailout package and debt cancellation, together with significant, painful reforms, are availed, to rebuild rather than revive the ailing economy.According to NewsDay (March 16, 2015), with the US dollar strengthening against most currencies (hitting a 12-year high against a basket of major currencies), International Monetary Fund chief Christine Largarde has warned that “those countries and corporates that have borrowed extensively in dollar-denominated loans are going to suffer”.Zimbabwe (re:Chinese and Russian mega deals?) and Zimbabwean corporates may be two such examples. Even local debt, for both country and corporates, is dollar-denominated. And so is local household debt. Farmers, too, have not been spared. The effect on the cotton industry has been catastrophic as US dollar prices have fallen. The tobacco industry may be the next victim. Current prices in US dollars are down some 17% year-on-year. They are more of course in other currencies.The euro, the world’s second major currency, “has dropped a hefty 25% versus the dollar since around the middle of 2014”, noted the Reuters story carried by NewsDay. It also noted that the European currency once worth as much as $1,40 could drop to as low as $0,80 as the European Central Bank continues its printing of money, alongside the Bank of Japan. The South African rand too has recently fallen to a 13-year low in value versus the US dollar.Even innovation-laden American exports are suffering from the US dollar’s strength. Zimbabwe’s commodity exports will be hit harder. The Zimbabwe cost base, labour included, may remain the same in US dollar terms but has risen significantly over the past year or so in other currencies such as the rand. This makes the economic and social landscapes less competitive production wise and as an investment destination, leading to job losses and failure to create new jobs.Meanwhile, the prices of commodities, on which Zimbabwe largely depends for hard currency export earnings, have taken a dramatic southern shift. Slowing growth in China as it remodels its economy, placing more emphasis on services rather than manufacturing has largely been blamed. The strengthening dollar has added to the woes.Zimbabwe stands right in the middle. Other countries which were in the same spot have since taken evasive action. Switzerland, caught in the middle due to pegging its currency to the euro, removed the peg off its franc. Singapore eased monetary policy, allowing its currency to fall to its lowest level against the US dollar since 2010. The Bank of Canada followed suit pushing its Canadian dollar down to $0,80 from $0,94.Zimbabwean authorities are, however, seized by paralysis. They could change the anchor currency to the rand taking the opportunity to slash salaries and costs by using an exchange rate or ZAR10 to the USD. Or they could create a virtual currency pegged to a basket of currencies biased towards the rand and pula. Salaries and prices could then be based on this “bond dollar”, which a 25% devaluation could re-base salaries to 2009 levels. Both initiatives could restore competitiveness, wading off imported deflation.In addition, an austerity drive can no longer be avoided. Public sector head count and the number of ministries have to be halved.In the exercise there should be “no holy cows”. Extractive industries-based ZimAsset is no longer the golden parachute it was thought to be.Tapiwa Nyandoro can be contacted on nyandoro.osbert1@gmail.com or feedback@newsday.co.zw
In late January, Kuwaiti satirist Muhammad al-Ajmi was leaving home when his vehicle was surrounded by five cars. He described to the BBC how more than 10 men - some armed - handcuffed and blindfolded him, and bundled him into the back of a car.Hours later, his family received a phone call telling them that he was being detained by state security.The 26-year-old has become well-known for his daring satire. He has more than 150,000 followers on Twitter, where he is known by the name of Abo Asam.His willingness to put the spotlight on political and religious figures has seen him detained on a number of occasions.This time, the public prosecutor told him his detention was based on a complaint from the Saudi Foreign Ministry about tweets he had posted over the previous three months.The charges included offending the Saudi royal family and harming the image of human rights in Saudi Arabia.Mr Al-Ajmi is not an isolated case. In recent months Kuwait has arrested several people deemed to have made offensive remarks about other Gulf states.This is being seen as an indication of closer cooperation between Kuwait and its fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries in matters of state security.But while the other GCC states take a tough line on domestic critics, Kuwait's Emir recently announced a "zero-tolerance" policy concerning criticism aimed at other countries and their rulers, which are perceived to be harmful to Kuwait's foreign relations.Rights groups have criticised arrests on similar charges in recent months for what they perceive as the heavy-handed tactics of Kuwaiti state security.The journalist Hamid Buyabis is currently being detained on a UAE complaint about tweets allegedly insulting the crown prince of Dubai.The head of the opposition Civil Democratic Movement Tariq al-Mutairi was briefly detained earlier in March at the request of the Saudi Foreign Ministry.Mr Al-Ajmi has expressed concern that the cases are based on an article of the state security law which carries a life sentence for anyone charged with committing an act exposing Kuwait to the threat of war, or causing it to cut diplomatic ties with another country."Do the opinions and words of a person who does not have an official position cause diplomatic ties to be cut?" he has asked.He also told the BBC: "I don't have a problem with the Saudi authorities lodging a case of slander against me, but my opinions are not a matter of state security, which involves mobilising troops or carrying out or inciting an act of aggression."The deputy Speaker of Kuwait's National Assembly, Mubarak al-Khrinej, told the BBC that the arrests are in accordance with Kuwaiti domestic law, which prohibits criticism or harmful comments against leaders or officials of other countries.But he says that he is strongly in favour of the GCC security agreement, at a time when Kuwait and the Gulf are surrounded by regional threats.Mr Al-Khrinej says Kuwait's freedoms remain "protected and guaranteed for all", but stressed the importance of security above all else: "What is the point of democracy and freedom if you do not have security?"BBC Monitoring reports and analyses news from TV, radio, web and print media around the world.

Go Lam is sitting in her new office cubicle and can barely believe her luck. She is neatly dressed, eager to make a good impression. Fingers at the keyboard, raring to go.The 28-year-old refugee from Myanmar is among the first Australians to "work for the dole" under the Abbott government's signature policy, which has been the subject of sweeping criticism from welfare agencies nationwide.Social service leaders roundly condemn the scheme – requiring Australians aged 18-30 who have been unemployed for more than a year to do volunteer work to receive Centrelink – as a waste of money that will not improve people's skills or help them land jobs.But Ms Lam, perched at her workstation at a non-profit office in Melbourne's west, feels she on the brink of a bright future. She hopes to study office administration at TAFE later this year."I have never worked in an office before ... it has taught me about what it's like to work in Australia," she said."I have been working for three months and the experience it has given me has been very good."Australia's biggest migrant and refugee settlement service, AMES, has thrown its support behind the policy ahead of the planned national rollout on July 1.The organisation, which runs English language and vocational training programs for new arrivals, has hundreds of clients participating in the pilot work-for-the-dole program in Melbourne alone, and says it has "hugely benefitted" their jobseekers by providing practical skills and workplace referees.AMES employment manager Maha Mohamed said the benefits to new migrant and refugees would also apply to the swelling ranks of Australia's long-term unemployed."A lot of people who have been unemployed for a long time have been complacent in their comfort zones for a long time," she said."Many have lost confidence in the system and lost confidence in themselves. This program can give them a reality check and an opportunity to reassess themselves ... bring back some energy and help them rebuild their networks and relearn how to communicate with people."Ms Mohamed said 200 of her refugee and migrant jobseeker clients across Sunshine, St Albans, Werribee and Footscray were participating in the scheme and working in jobs including gardening, hospitality, office work and customer service."Perhaps the most important factor of all is that getting out into the workplace and actually performing a meaningful role gives people confidence in themselves and the confidence needed to go out and fined a real job," she said.But AMES' vote of support for the scheme has clashed with the calls from Australia's broader community sector and many academics.In its 2015 budget commission, the Australian Council of Social Services says the $350 million earmarked for the work-for-the-dole program should be redirected.The council argues that participation work-for-benefits programs have "little or no impact" on people's job prospects, pointing to federal government data from July 2014 showing just 19 per cent of participants were employed three months later."The main drawback for work-for-benefits schemes is that the work experience participants usually receive is well-removed from paid employment opportunities," the submission said."To invest in this program on a large scale is therefore an inefficient use of public resources [and] it is not reasonable to require people to undertake a program that will not improve their job prospects, especially where it involves working for less than the minimum wage."
A spate of vandalism at playparks across Perth and Kinross has left children exposed to danger and council taxpayers footing a bill running into thousands of pounds.In one case senseless damage led to a child being injured.The relatively new area at the North Inch has suffered fire damage, while the Perth Leisure Centre park was also hit.Perth and Kinross Council is now appealing to the public to help protect the district’s 150 play areas by being vigilant and reporting any suspicious activity.A particularly costly piece of vandalism at Perth’s North Inch play area involved a swing which was set on fire.“This is the second time that this piece of play equipment has been significantly damaged,” said a council spokesman.“The damage not only takes the equipment out of use until it is repaired, the repairs themselves are usually expensive, this particular vandalism being estimated to cost the public purse £3,660.“This money should be used to improve or replace old or worn out equipment elsewhere meaning other children will now lose out.“The nature of this crime and the fact it takes place overnight has led to the conclusion that the damage is being carried out by older individuals.“Thanks to the thoughtless actions of a few, the council has also recently had to repair two spring mobiles which were vandalised.”The spokesman said: “More worryingly (the council) has been made aware of a child who was injured because the bolts had been removed from the seat backs of a piece of equipment they were playing on which rocks four ways.“The council is also seeking information from residents on a recent spate of vandalism to equipment provided in the play area at Perth Leisure Pool resulting in significant damage to a number of items including climbing units, sand tables and megaphones.“Estimates on the cost of repairing or, where needed, replacing these items are currently undertaken and are expected to be quite considerable.”The vandalism angered mother Wendy Macfarlane from Craigie, whose children regularly use the North Inch and the leisure pool park.“It is such a moronic thing to do, what is the point?” she said.“Not only does it make a terrible impression for visitors to Perth, it is difficult to explain to the kids why people would deliberately damage play equipment.”Douglas Pover, convener of Perth and Kinross Council’s Community Safety Committee, urged the public to play their part in catching those responsible.He said: “I am saddened to hear that the inconsiderate actions of a minority have ruined the enjoyment of one of our play areas for its users.“I would urge residents who notice any damage or vandalism to equipment to either report it to Police Scotland or alternatively report it on the council’s website www.pkc.gov.uk or telephone the council’s customer service centre on 01738 476476 with the location of the play area, details of the damaged or vandalised play equipment and when you noticed the damage had happened.”Anyone with information on graffiti which has appeared on the flood wall on Perth’s Tay Street is also urged to contact the police or the council.
KwaZulu-Natal is a province hard hit by tuberculosis. In December, Department of Health head, Dr Sibongile Zungu, said according to statistics from 2013, there were 99 067 cases of TB in the province, of which 6 916 were children under the age of five.The province has the highest co-infection rate, with 65 percent of those infected with TB also being HIV positive.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), TB is caused by bacteria (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) that most often affect the lungs.It is spread from person to person through the air.When people with lung TB cough, sneeze or spit, they propel the TB germs into the air and a person needs to inhale only a few of these germs to become infected.But the issue is about far more than health for community-care groups on the ground. Eradicating TB encompasses fighting social stigmas and enlisting the help of the very people on the front lines of the battle.For TB programme manager of the SA Red Cross Society, Sikhumbuzo Biyela, recruiting volunteers from the areas they were trying to help including their traditional leaders – was something of a no-brainer.“When it’s someone from your area, someone you trust, knocking at your door you’re more inclined to listen to what that person has to say. The message will be delivered more effectively,” he said.Biyela said tapping into this available resource allowed the organisation access to people who normally shied away from seeking help if they nursed suspicions of being ill.“They are more likely to reach out to people who they are familiar with. We also give our volunteers some training to help them deal with this.”The organisation provides courses in basic counselling; HIV and TB awareness; home-based care; and psycho social support and mental health programmes.It supports prevention, treatment adherence and care for 23 000 adult and 23 000 orphaned and vulnerable children annually, within seven municipalities, including Ugu, Umgungundlovu, eThekwini, Uthungulu, Amajuba and Sisonke.The KwaZulu-Natal TB programme has more than 1 500 volunteers and 194 staff supporting this group of more than 40 000 people infected and affected by the pandemic.“The care also consists of assistance with grant application, collection and monitoring of medications, provision of food parcels, training and income generating activities.”The organisation, since its inception in 2007, has raised awareness on the issue to more than 1.9 million people.“We are seeing huge differences in the attitudes towards those who are infected.“When we first started, we saw disturbing trends as a result of the stigma attached to the disease. People were locked in separate rooms. People were killed. Now, we see many more people coming forward, seeking help,” Biyela said.Where people had been guarded and even resentful of the group’s “interference” in their areas, they now seemed more appreciative of efforts, he said.Traditional healers were also vital in gaining the trust of the people in the communities they served.“People, if they are ill, often consult sangomas. They don’t go to the clinic so we knew that we needed to furnish these healers with the information on TB and HIV that they could share with their clients.”The healers advise people on how to live with and prevent infection, and what to do in the event of becoming infected.“They are one of our most important stakeholders.”A pilot project – carried out last year by the US Aid TB Programme, Durban University of Technology, the KwaZulu-Natal Health Department and KZN Traditional Health Practitioners in the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal – found at least 41 percent of TB patients used traditional healers first before Western medicine.Researchers also found that 84 percent of TB patients would rather have a traditional healer as a treatment supervisor than public health supervisors.About 40 percent said they had been seen by a healer at some point before their diagnosis.During the course of the project, 500 traditional leaders had been trained.Of the almost 20 000 patients they saw, they referred more than 360 suspected of being HIV positive for testing and 559 more for TB testing at hospitals.Using the influence of these healers is nothing new. During a 2001 study conducted in Hlabisa by the Medical Research Council, 89 percent of those whose treatment was supervised by traditional leaders completed the course, as compared to those supervised by a community health care worker.The 25 healers were trained in one-day directly observed therapy short course (Dots) programmes in TB management.“Our findings suggest that traditional healers are a potentially important resource to integrate TB control programmes… In Africa, south of the Sahara, the ratio of traditional healers to the population is about 1:500, in contrast to the doctor to population ratio of 1:40 000.”* Tuberculosis (TB) is second only to HIV/Aids, the greatest killer worldwide, due to a single infectious agent.* In 2013, 9 million people fell ill with TB and 1.5 million died from the disease.* More than 95 percent of TB deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries, and it is among the top 5 causes of death of women aged 15 to 44.* In 2013, an estimated 550 000 children became ill with TB and 80 000 HIV-negative children died of TB.* TB is a leading killer of HIV-positive people causing one fourth of all HIV-related deaths.* The estimated number of people falling ill with TB each year is declining, although very slowly, which means that the world is on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goal to reverse the spread of TB by 2015.* The TB death rate dropped 45 percent between 1990 and 2013.* An estimated 37 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2013.
Les sujets abordés par la presse congolaise ce mardi gravitent autour de la prochaine rencontre entre l’Autorité morale de la Majorité présidentielle et les députés et sénateurs de cette famille politique.« 2016 : Kabila prépare sa grande annonce », après la rencontre de Kingakati et avec des échanges annoncés avec députés et sénateurs de la Majorité présidentielle (MP), titre à la Une de son édition de ce mardi FORUM DES AS. Le chef de l’Etat congolais, rapporte le confrère, en sa qualité d’Autorité morale de la MP, ne connaît aucun moment de répit ces derniers temps. Depuis quelques temps, le Raïs semble plus chercher à écouter qu’à parler.  Lors de la dernière rencontre de Kingakati, dimanche dernier, Joseph Kabila a plutôt choisi de laisser les deux camps de sa famille politique (le groupe de sept partis dit G7 et les autres) s’exprimer librement. FORUM DES AS croit savoir que le chef de l’Etat prépare quelque chose et, pour ce faire, il se donne le temps d’écouter avant d’abattre sa carte finalement.  Que prépare donc Joseph Kabila ? La question est sur toutes les lèvres à l’approche des enjeux électoraux qui pointent déjà à l’horizon.  Pour certaines sources, le Raïs serait prêt à désigner son successeur parce qu’au terme de la Constitution, il est fin mandat en 2016 sans possibilité de renouvellement. Ce sujet serait au centre de la grande annonce que préparerait Joseph Kabila ? Difficile de le dire pour l’instant, avoue FORUM DES AS.  LE POTENTIEL, rapporte dans le même registre, que la fronde qui couvait au sein de la MP ne semble pas avoir totalement ébranlé les lignes. Celle-ci se bat pour préserver son unité et sa cohésion autour de son Autorité morale, Joseph Kabila. Après la rencontre restreinte de dimanche dernier à Kingakati, une autre est prévue dans les prochains jours ; toujours au même endroit. Cette fois-là, la rencontre sera élargie à tous les députés et sénateurs de la MP avec pour objectif d’adopter une ligne d’attaque commune.  LE POTENTIEL note que la rencontre de Kingakati dimanche dernier a permis certes d’atténuer les tensions, mais elle n’a pas désamorcé la bombe. Pour sa survie, la Majorité a intérêt à se dépasser et surtout à surmonter ses clivages internes. En attendant 2016, la Majorité doit démontrer qu’elle a mûri et qu’elle est prête à vaincre ses contradictions.  L’AVENIR pour sa part est d’avis que la consolidation de la Majorité présidentielle est en marche. C’est dans cette perspective que s’inscrit l’entretien que l’Autorité morale de cette famille politique compte avoir dans les tout prochains jours avec les députés et les sénateurs de la MP.  Le cadre sera indiqué pour aborder toutes les questions majeures et fâcheuses de l’heure, en vue de consolider, quoi qu’il en soit, cette MP au sein de laquelle plusieurs sons discordants se font déjà entendre.  Contrairement aux professionnels de la politique de terre brûlée, le groupe de sept, dit G-7, réunissant les partis politiques pointés du doigt, notamment le MSR de Pierre Lumbi, l’UNADEF de Charles Mwando, l’UNAFEC de Gabriel Kyungu, l’ARC d’Olivier Kamitatu, le PDC de José Endundo, l’ACO de PatricK Bologna et le MSDD de Christophe Lutundula y ont accordé leurs violons.  L’OBSERVATEUR rapporte que les sénateurs ont entamé l’examen de la proposition de loi sur l’accès à l’information lundi 23 mars courant. La proposition de loi a été transmise à la commission Politique, administrative et juridique pour un examen approfondi, à l’issue du débat général qui s’est en suivi.  LA PROSPERITE signale au sujet des élections locales que la CENI convoque les partis politiques au Palais du peuple. La centrale électorale veut déjà concevoir les documents électoraux en vue des élections locales et provinciales. Pour ce faire, tous les partis politiques autorisés par le ministère de l’intérieur doivent transmettre, le vendredi 27 mars, les logos officiels. La réunion concerne les mandataires et non les chefs des partis politiques. A la CENI, l’histoire de la caravane qui passe et du chien qui aboie est toujours d’actualité. Quelque 1010 postes sont à pourvoir et le processus de recrutement est lancé.  Théodore Ngangu/MMC
It seems strange that, for a player of Jack Ziebell's standing at North Melbourne, this would still be one of his main individual goals for the upcoming season."My goal this year is to play every game and I'm going to work really hard to do that, to make sure I'm out there every week," Ziebell said on Tuesday. "It's something I'm really focused on."Despite his enormous talent, it is something the 24-year-old has never done in his six seasons at Arden Street, although he has come close a few times.It of course has nothing to do with his ability to contribute to the team, and all to do with his fearless attack on the ball, which has led to injuries, some severe, and also suspensions.Last season, he played 20 of a possible 25 matches and, by the end, required shoulder surgery.It prompted both he and the club to assess certain parts of his game to ensure that Ziebell did not miss crucial matches during the Roos' push for a premiership."Some of the positions I get my body into, especially around tackling, it's not ideal for my shoulders," he said."So I had a chat with the coach and our sport science guys about my tackling technique."Despite ranking fifth at the club for total tackles last season, Ziebell conceded his technique needed to improve.And last Saturday came a painful reminder that there was still some work to do after he was knocked out attempting to tackle a Richmond opponent.Ziebell admitted he was out of position when he tried to stop a charging Alex Rance in the NAB Challenge match and "paid the price", suffering a concussion from an on-field incident for the first time in his career.His health has improved every day since, to the point where he will return to full training next week and looks a certain starter for round one.It seems every time Ziebell goes down, there are fears for his longevity in the game, perhaps comparable but not at the same level yet to the discussion that followed Jonathan Brown late in his career.Confronted with the question again by reporters on Tuesday, Ziebell said he had no such concerns and, save for the minor technique improvements, he did not plan to change his overall style."If you take away a player's instincts, what is he playing with?" the tough midfielder pondered."You look at Daniel Wells, he plays on his instincts," he said."He is a beautiful mover, he kicks the ball really well. If you take that away from him, what sort of player is he?"So for me personally, I'm still going to play on my instincts."
Athens - Greece said it will present a package of reforms to its euro zone partners by next Monday in hope of unlocking aid to help it deal with a cash crunch and avoid default.“It will be done at the latest by Monday,” government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis told Mega TV.Greece's left-wing government and its euro zone creditors agreed last week that Athens would come up with a list of its own reforms, which must achieve a similar budget impact to measures agreed by the previous conservative-led administration.Athens is rushing to get the list ready before state coffers run empty, which is expected to happen in a few weeks without more aid.Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Monday but Sakellaridis said the two only discussed the outline of the reforms without going into depth.“I believe points of convergence were found,” he said.The reforms are a deeply politically sensitive issue for Tsipras, who stormed to power pledging to end austerity policies before being forced to accept an extension to a hated bailout programme under the threat of a banking collapse.Sakellaridis said the package of reforms Athens will propose would not contain recessionary measures but structural changes.If Greece's creditors agree that the substitute reforms can achieve an impact equivalent to previously agreed measures, Athens would get more loans from the euro zone and the International Monetary Fund, averting bankruptcy.On Tuesday, newspaper Kathimerini said Athens would ask the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) to hand it back 1.2 billion euros out of 10.9 billion euros of mostly EFSF bonds its bank rescue fund returned last month.It said Athens believes the rescue fund should have returned only 9.7 billion euros of its remaining cushion as the remaining amount was cash rather than EFSF bonds.The fund returned the sum to the EFSF last month as part of a February 20 Eurogroup agreement that extended Greece's bailout by four months.
BENENIA Jeche, a 39-year-old single female who lives in the rural areas of Chiendambuya in Headlands, relies on subsistence farming as her only source of income.She is a very ambitious woman, and one day hopes that she will be lucky to get a big farm where she will not only grow enough food to feed her family, but will also do farming as a commercial project like the men she often sees running huge farms.Being a mother of one, she has to fend for her daughter and take her to school using money that she gets from the sale of maize that she farms on her one-and-a-half-hectare plot in Ward 5, Makoni, in Chiendambuya.“I am a single mother of one – a grown up girl, but although I am a subsistence farmer, I managed to send her up to Advanced Level using the income I get from my subsistence farming projects,” Jeche said.“I am looking forward to my daughter going up to university level, but I am stuck because as a rural woman farmer I do not have the resources to do bigger farming projects and make more money.” Jeche said the income that she got from selling produce from her farm was a mere $60 per month.Apart from maize farming, Jeche also keeps a few livestock, 150 chickens and seven cows.“I started farming in 2011 and my income is too little because it depends on seasons. When it is not the rainy season I concentrate on gardening projects and I sell the vegetables that I get so that I get a small income as well as food to feed my small family. In 2014 I had a good yield and sold four tonnes of maize to the Grain Marketing Board (GMB), but they still have not paid me for the maize. This has disturbed my operations for the new farming season as it would be difficult for me to buy inputs if the GMB has not paid me,” she said.Jeche’s experiences are not different from other rural women the world over.To try and avert their continuous suffering, as well as to help them make inroads into making farming a serious income generating business, the Rural Women’s Assembly platform was established in 2009 following a meeting of rural women in Limpopo, South Africa. Women from nine Sadc countries had converged there to deliberate on issues that affected women across the continent and they mobilised rural women farmers from ward, district and national levels to discuss and promote their social and economic needs and how they could become serious players in agriculture.This gave birth to Women and Land in Zimbabwe, an organisation that started to mobilise rural women in Makoni, Wedza, Chimanimani, Shurugwi, Nkayi, Gwanda and Gweru.The organisation, with the assistance of other non-governmental organisations such as the Southern Africa Parliamentary Support Trust (SAPST), has helped groom these rural women in order for them to amplify their voices to take part in influencing policies at local, regional and international levels.After undergoing capacity building with some of these organisations the women were ready to appear at high institutions such as Parliament to speak out on issues that troubled them in their operations in the agricultural sector.Some members of the Rural Women’s Assembly recently appeared before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Lands, Agriculture and Irrigation Development chaired by Mbire MP David Butau.Prisca Chikwee, a rural subsistence farmer from Shurugwi, told the committee that although they were thankful for the Presidential farm input support scheme, they felt it was not enough.“We feel that agro dealers are not supplying us with enough seed, and their prices are too high and beyond the reach of rural women subsistence farmers. The way they stock their seed is poor and as a result we do not produce good yields. Due to climate change, there is need to promote indigenous seeds so that farmers use seed that suits the new rainfall patterns. Seed suppliers do not seem to realise this,” Chikwee said.She said rural women farmers also experienced serious shortages of fertilisers and they acquired their seed late resulting in poor yields.“There is also inadequate supply of dip chemicals for livestock and sometimes when the chemicals are availed, they are not very effective. This leads to loss of draught power.”Chikwee said government should intervene by taking steps to recognise locally produced seed and increase the number of seed and fertiliser dealers to ensure that supply met demand, as well as ensure that inputs were affordable.“Rural women farmers are failing to get loans because banks want collateral. We do not have ownership of land and most of the time whenever a family gets land; it is recorded in the name of the husband. We propose that land should be recorded jointly in the names of husband and wife,” she said.Other women alleged whenever district administrators or headmen parcelled out land, they preferred to allocate it to men, resulting in land being owned by husbands or the first born son.She said due to that rural women had no money and could not access loans; they could not install irrigation equipment at their farms.“Food security depends on good rainfall and if there is drought our farming projects fail. Government must build dams at rural areas so that we do not necessarily depend on rain. If we have irrigation equipment we can be able to supply the GMB with a lot of grains continuously. Last year in July we delivered a lot of maize, but we still have not been paid and cannot prepare for the next farming season,” Chikwee said.Another female farmer Agatha Changunda from Makoni said one of the biggest hurdles that rural women farmers faced was access to markets to sell their produce as well as a very poor road network.“Farmers have challenges in accessing markets due to poor road networks. The available markets are quite a distance from their communities and it is expensive to transport their produce to the markets. The roads are so bad to the extent even scotch carts or lorries fail to assist us with transporting our produce,” Changunda said.She said at times their produce was under valued to the extent they made heavy losses.“Government must improve the road and communication networks. Value addition centres such as the Chiundura Value Addition Centre must be increased. We also need introduction of regulated green markets in the rural areas rather than the roadside markets that female farmers end up using to sell their produce. Market information platforms must also be improved.”Changunda said as a result of lack of information of where to market their produce, as well as low pricing, they ended up selling their produce using the barter trade system at roadsides at $2 per bucket of maize.She also alleged there was a lot of corruption at markets to sell their produce, including at big companies.“We are concerned that we are being forced to pay money that is not receipted for whenever we need the services of the Zimbabwe Republic Police to clear our livestock, or even the services of veterinarians.“The pricing model of tobacco is another issue of concern because the same grade of tobacco is sold at different prices, depending on whether the seller is a contract farmer or not. Farmers are also forced to pay kick backs to the auction floor workers to get a good grade for their crop,” Changunda said.Other problems faced by the rural women farmers were said to be an influx of farmers preferring to grow other crops such as tobacco, which threatened food security.“Tobacco contractors sometimes reduce the price of the same grade of tobacco. Women farmers are also made to sign contracts that they do not understand. Our cattle are not accessing dip tanks yet we pay fees in order for them to be dipped four times per year. They are dipped only once per year and it exposes them to diseases,” she said. Beria Zengeni from Wedza said there was need to introduce other forms of energy like the use of Tsotso stoves at rural areas to avoid deforestation.“There is deforestation in the rural areas because people are cutting down trees for firewood to use for cooking, or sale due to high unemployment rates and tobacco curing. Some youths use it for brick moulding to cure bricks. There is need for rural electrification so that people can use electric gadgets such as stoves rather than firewood as it would help reduce cutting down of trees. Government must facilitate the increased usage of solar energy,” Zengeni said.According to Thandiwe Chidavarove, a representative of women in the agricultural sector, agriculture was the backbone of the Zimbabwean economy and 80% of farmers were women, while 23% of the population were formally employed in the agricultural sector.“To solve the issues bedevilling women in agriculture, we need representation of women at policy making forums and at farmers ‘unions. We also need representation of women in traditional leadership so that women issues are taken up. If rural women farmers do not have representation, they will continue to be downtrodden. It is expensive for women to afford agricultural inputs. We are not saying they need to get free distribution of inputs, but they need subsidies in terms of fertiliser, seed, and even tillage services,” Chidavarove said.Zimbabwe Farmers’ Union president Abdul Credit Nyathi said in a quest to support rural women farmers and after noting that 80% of farming was done by women, they established a women’s wing at ZFU. “We have also said we should have a third ZFU vice-president who is a woman to address the challenges that women farmers are facing,” Nyathi said.
Ambassador Schmidt is the Regional Director for Sub-Saharan Africa and Sahel of the German Federal Foreign Office, visiting Zimbabwe from 23rd to 24th March 2015.Schmidt underlined that the Constitution is a “new departure for Zimbabwe” which would protect individual dignity, grant democratic space and social rights. He emphasized that it will be all citizens who will first and foremost benefit from a clear and transparent “rule of law” system protecting their political and economic rights.“A successful process of constitutional alignment as well as economic reform will also have positive impact on the improvement of Germany’s economic relationship with Zimbabwe. Economic interaction needs legal protection, foreign investors in particular need guarantees and clarity concerning their investments.”Schmidt stressed “should the positive signals in the process of constitutional alignment and economic reform prove to be sustainable Germany is prepared to enter into an open dialogue with the Zimbabwean Government on ways out of the economic crisis, including the burdensome debt problem. I came to Harare in this spirit.”During his visit Schmidt had meetings with Vice-President and Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs, Hon. Emmerson Mnangagwa, the Minister of Finance, Hon. Patrick Chinamasa, the Minister of Welfare Services for War Veterans, Hon. Christopher Mutsvangwa and representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as well as members of the opposition. Have your say:
Notts County striker Ellen White has not given up on her England World Cup dream after scoring on her club return after an 11-month injury lay-off.White made her Notts debut in Sunday's FA Cup fifth-round win over Tottenham.A serious knee injury prevented the ex-Arsenal forward from featuring in a competitive game for Notts in 2014."You can't not think about the World Cup because it is such an amazing achievement to be involved in it," White, 25, told BBC Radio Nottingham."But now I'm looking for form for Notts and minutes on the pitch and goals. Anything else is an absolute bonus."White, who has 17 goals in 47 games for England, signed for the Lady Magpies in December 2013.But she was injured in a pre-season friendly and had to watch from the sidelines as Notts finished sixth in the eight-team Women's Super League One last season.And although playing in the World Cup in Canada in June is an enticing prospect, the Notts vice-captain says her focus has to be on her domestic form after such a long period out of action.She continued: "It's been fantastic to be here for over a year now and it has been a long-awaited debut, but I couldn't have asked for a better one really."All that emotion showed as I punched my fist in the air. I was happy to get on the scoresheet. It's an amazing feeling to be back with the team and back on the pitch."It was quite an emotional performance for me. I just wanted to work hard and I was pretty tired at the end."Notts host last season's WSL 1 runners-up Chelsea in their first league game on Sunday.
Corden has taken over from Scottish-born Craig Ferguson to host the US talkshow and although it's quite the task, he managed to well and truly nail it, according to the US audience. Playing on the fact that he's still relatively unknown across the pond, the comedian couldn't thank viewers enough for tuning in. Mila Kunis and Tom Hanks both appeared on the first show, that's filmed in Los Angeles from Monday to Friday. There were also pre-recorded skits from the likes of Simon Cowell, Eddie Redmayne and Meryl Streep.Corden said when introducing himself: "I really couldn't be more honoured to be talking to you now and believe me, no matter how shocked you are to have this job, you will never be as shocked as I am." "I promise you we are going to have fun on this show and we will do everything we can to put a smile on your face before, or lets be honest, more likely while you fall asleep," the funnyman then said. "What a privilege it is to have a show like this and I really do promise not to let any of you down."The host, who moved to Los Angeles with his wife Julia and their two children - Max and Carey - late last year, begged viewers not to judge the show prematurely. However, when scouring the social media world after his first appearance, Twitter was full of positive comments. User Simon Breeze posted: "James Corden seemingly smashed it last night, what a guy." Dave Rose added: "Well, from what I've seen online @jkcorden did a great job last night. He could be huge once he settles in. #latelateshow"Shannon Burton also said: "Awesome show tonight @JKCorden! Super funny!! I'll be watching every night!! #thelateshow #JamesCorden"And the support didn't stop there. A group of audience members from Orange County also gushed about the British host to Sky News after the show.Brianne McDowell told reporters, according to the Mail Online: "I have never experienced anything like it. He was gracious and happy to have everyone there and he was so thankful for the opportunity. He was personable, talking about his family and his kids. He was really funny."
European shares inched higher in early trade on Tuesday after forecast-beating economic data from Germany helped offset a poor reading of Chinese factory activity.Figures showed Germany's private sector grew in March at its strongest rate since July, in a further sign that Europe's largest economy is gaining momentum.France's private sector expanded for the second straight month, chiming with recent figures showing that economy is edging back to growth.At 0850 GMT, the FTSEurofirst 300 index of top European shares was up 0.1 percent at 1,602.56 points, after losing 0.7 percent on Monday."The environment for the euro zone is getting extremely positive: low interest rates, a weakening euro and falling commodity prices, coupled with strong action from the ECB," said Christian Jimenez, fund manager and president of Diamant Bleu Gestion, in Paris."The only big risk seen in the medium term is the prospect of a rate hike by the Fed, but that's mostly priced in already."Investors were also keeping a close eye on the euro, trading at $1.0982 against the dollar on Tuesday, pulling further away from a 12-year trough of $1.0457 hit last week.European stocks have rallied strongly since the start of the year -- with Germany's DAX up 21 percent, on track to record its best quarter since late 2003 -- as global investors bet that a weaker euro would boost the region's economy and corporate earnings."With FX moves dominating all else, European equities are now showing improving profitability through margin expansion. The market is yet to pay a full valuation for this in our view," BNP Paribas strategists wrote in a note.Around Europe, Britain's FTSE 100 index was up 0.2 percent, Germany's DAX up 0.3 percent, and France's CAC 40 up 0.3 percent.Shares in Carrefour fell 1.5 percent after the supermarket chain sold 12.7 million treasury shares, representing 1.7 percent of its share capital, in a private placement.Resource-related shares were under pressure, with Royal Dutch Shell down 0.2 percent and Rio Tinto down 0.3 percent, after data showed activity in China's factory sector dipped to a 11-month low in March as new orders shrank, signalling persistent weakness in the world's biggest consumer of commodities.
Two sex attacks on young women in what were believed to be unlicensed taxis may be linked.Both victims were travelling alone and had been drinking when they were attacked in Nottingham, police said.The first attack took place just after midnight on 21 March, when a woman was sexually assaulted at Greyfriar Gate.The next day another woman got into a taxi in Goldsmith Street and was later assaulted by the driver. Police urged women travelling alone to be careful.Det Sgt Dan Bebbington, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: "Both were young females, under the influence of alcohol and travelling alone ... and on both occasions they thought they were getting into a taxi."Police have warned women travelling alone to be careful about using unlicensed taxis."In both incidents women thought they were safely travelling home from a night out but that turned out not to be the case," Det Insp Pete Quinn said."We are conducting our enquiries around unlicensed taxis and would urge people to be aware of the dangers of using them,"He recommended women book taxis in advance if possible and always check taxi identification before getting into the vehicle.
The right notes: Martin Gravener is also a talented pianistAn auction house worker with a talent for classical jazz has no plans to retire - despite reaching the grand age of 88.Staff at Bainbridges Auction House have wished happy birthday to their remarkable colleague Martin Gravener.After reaching almost nine decades on Friday, March 20, he does not intend to stop working any time soon, reports Get West London.He said: “I have been working here for 24 years.“I like meeting the people, I’ve always been interested in antiques and I love the business.

The Australian Netflix has officially launched but has 7000 fewer titles than the US version, new analysis claims.After the video streaming service became available in Australia at 12am on Tuesday, Sydney software developer Kenneth Tsang analysed the titles available.Mr Tsang found roughly 1326 titles were available through the Australian Netflix compared to an estimated 8499 in the US and 4400 in Canada.To arrive at the figure he used software that extracted all titles in the "browse" categories on Netflix's Australian website and then put it in a spreadsheet for easy viewing."As usual, it looks like Australians are still getting less titles available," he wrote on his website."One can only hope the list of titles offered by Netflix in Australia will increase as time goes on."Another analysis, performed by Gyde and Goodfilms, which lets people legally find movies to watch online, found that the Australian Netflix had 220 TV series available (432 TV seasons, 7327 individual TV episodes) and 900 movies. This compares to 940 TV series available on the US version (2124 TV seasons, 34,332 individual TV episodes) and 6170 movies.A Netflix spokesman said Mr Tsang's figures were incorrect but would not provide a better comparison.But the spokesman confirmed that the Australian catalogue offered fewer titles than the US version."I can tell you the numbers [calculated by Mr Tsang] are incorrect on both ends," the spokesman said."That said, we never reveal catalogue numbers - not because we're trying to hide anything but because it's irrelevant."... Each country catalogue is focused on quality over quantity."Despite Australians having access to far fewer titles, the Australian version does have several hundred unique titles - ones which aren't available on the US or Canadian Netflix.This comes about from the various deals Netflix has struck around the globe, such as with the ABC to resurface some of its back catalogue.Earlier this year, Netflix said that the content available to Australians on day one might not be what they expected."The catalogue that the Australians will see on day one will improve on day 30, and day 90, or every couple of weeks – sometimes every day, as we have more content coming in," Netflix's vice-president of product innovation, Todd Yellin, told Australian journalists at the Consumer Electronics Show."So they shouldn't look at it as, 'This is what you get at Netflix?' when they look at the catalogue on day one. They should look at, 'Wow! This is what I get now, and that thing is just going to keep growing and getting better and better'."Now that the Australian catalogue has finally been revealed, the 200,000 Australians estimated to already be accessing the US Netflix via location-faking software can now make an informed choice of whether they should switch to the Australian version or stay on the US version.The release of the catalogue follows Netflix formally announcing its Australian pricing on Monday. ‎It will offer three pricing tiers, with the cheapest at $8.99.But the entry-level service will deliver streamed content in standard definition only.  Netflix will also offer an $11.99 plan, which will allow high-definition streaming to up to two screens.A third plan, costing $14.99, will allow streaming of the highest quality content, 4K, to up to four screens.Netflix will compete against Stan, which is priced at $10 a month and offers high definition streaming. Stan is owned by Fairfax Media and the Nine Network.Netflix's other key rival, the Foxtel- and Seven Network-backed Presto, is priced at $9.99. It only offers content in standard definition.Another competitor in the Australian market, Quickflix, offers its streaming service for $9.99 a month.Netflix, however, isn't collecting GST, meaning it has a 10 per cent cost-advantage over all of the Australian-based services.But this could soon change, with the government indicating companies like Netflix need to pay GST when they come into the country.The issue will be considered in the upcoming discussion paper on tax reform, due to be released next week.Clarification: An earlier version of this article said Netflix Australia had 693 unique titles - ones which aren't available on the US or Canadian Netflix. But Mr Tsang now says that number is not correct due to the way Netflix labels its content differently in each country. He says he is taking another look at the data to see if a comparison is possible. Mr Tsang's number of estimated available titles in Australia has also been updated to reflect new analysis.

STOKE-ON-TRENT City Council have defended themselves following complaints about 'lack of maintenance' at a cemetery.The Sentinel reported yesterday that, as a result, grieving families have been forced to buy equipment to keep their loved-one's graves tidy.But Martyn Brindley, public protection strategic manager, said: "City council staff work tirelessly throughout the year to maintain all of Stoke-on-Trent's nine cemeteries."The grass is cut at least once a month during mowing season at Longton, as with every other cemetery, with the hedges and shrubbery trimmed once a year to keep the sites clean and tidy."
They met this week for their 32nd session in Victoria Falls town in Zimbabwe at Elephant Hills Resort to advance the policy direction of the ZRA and the utilization of the Zambezi River.ZRA COM chairperson, who is Zambia’s Minister of Mines, Energy and Water Development Christopher Yaluma Yaluma, said ZRA projects such as the rehabilitation of the Kariba Dam should become a reality adding that as it is now, the dam is a disaster to the entire southern region.He said though the US$ 294.2 million meant for the Kariba dam rehabilitation project is on paper, the project is expected to commence in September this year while the Batoka Hydro Electric Scheme project is earmarked for commencement in January 2016 to 2021.Zimbabwe’s Minister of Energy and Power Development Dr. Samuel Undenge was among the signatory of the communique.It was also reaffirmed that development of the Batoka Hydro Electric Scheme for the enhancement of power generation capacity in the two States would go ahead.The meeting resolved to recognize the role that the Zambezi Valley Development Fund continues to play in improving the livelihoods of the displaced communities around the dam as evidenced by the nineteen projects completed by the fund since 1997 .The meeting consequently approved budget of US$ 1 million allocated to ZRA project activities for 2015.Earlier during a press briefing shortly after a closed door meeting, Yaluma said Zambia and Zimbabwe shall remain committed to their bilateral co-operation in the development of ZRA projects between the two countries. The out-going ZRA COM Chairperson Undenge said ZRA has entered an exciting period focusing on the Batoka Hydro Electric Scheme whose feasibility studies are on-going and are scheduled to be completed in July this year.Undenge did not disclose the approximate amount expected to go towards the Batoka Hydro Electric Scheme but just said only US$ 6 million from World Bank was released for the feasibility study.ZRA is mandated to harness and manage the Zambezi River waters for socio-economic development and to maintain the Kariba dam complex including any future dams or infrastructure on the river forming a common border between the two countries.

Britain is to "beef up" its military presence on the Falkland Islands amid claims there is a heightened risk of invasionDefence Secretary Michael Fallon will announce reinforcements of troops and equipment following a Ministry of Defence review suggesting an attack on the South Atlantic archipelago is more likely."I'm going to be announcing to Parliament later today how we're going to beef up defences there, how we're going to modernise our defences," he told Sky News.He added that he intended "to reassure the islanders that we're absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands"."We're modernising what we're doing there and I'm going to talk about the various capabilities and equipment we have there," he said."I can't give you too much detail of that  because I can't even tell Parliament all the details of how we defend the Falklands, but what I can assure you is that we're absolutely committed to defending the Falklands."The threat to the Falklands has not gone away."Around 1,200 troops are based on the islands along with a small fleet of Sea King helicopters and RAF Typhoon jets.Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner has revived tensions over the islands, which her country calls Las Malvinas, since she came to power.Speculation emerged in December that Russia had agreed to supply fighter jets to Argentina in return for beef and wheat, to circumvent European sanctions imposed on Moscow over its actions in Ukraine.Foreign Affairs Editor Sam Kiley said a "devastating" Defence Select Committee report suggested British armed forces would not be capable of retaking the islands if they were successfully invaded."They've definitely got to get in and defend if the Argentines are boosting their military capabilities and posing some threat to the Falklands," he said."The reality is: They're not and they're not. Ultimately they want to get the Falklands back, (but) they're not going to go to war with Britain over it."They are boosting their military capability, but in a pretty insignificant way."Prime Minister David Cameron, in his last Christmas message to the Islanders, announced a bronze statue of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher would be unveiled this year in the British territory.
Gosport Mills, at Outlane, was the business of the Sykes family for 70 years and survived fires and tragedy.The tragedy was the death of Edward Sykes in 1864 when he was thrown from his gig after the horse bolted going down Crimble Clough, near Slaithwaite.He was taken to the Swan Inn at Crimble where he died two days after the accident.Audrey Bamforth of Crosland Moor has discovered fascinating details about the mills during a research project she started because her son’s house is on part of the site.The mill was in existence in 1857 and operated under the Sykes family name until 1927.One fire, in 1928, was in a part of the premises known as Gosport Old Mills, that were owned by Thomas G Armstrong and Co Ltd, who went into liquidation later that year.Joseph Hoyle, of Longwood, bought Gosport mills for £3,100 in 1939 and Audrey believes they were sold to John Smith and Sons in 1970, after company premises at Badger Hill Mills at Rastrick, had been damaged by fire.John Smith and Sons carried on business at Gosport Mills and the undamaged part of Badger Hill Mills until January 1973, when the demolition of an unsafe chimney at Badger Hill Mills went horrifically wrong. Instead of the chimney falling into an emptied dam, it corkscrewed and fell, instead, on to previously undamaged parts of the mill.”By the end of 1974, the business had gone into liquidation. Part of the site had already been sold for housing and Grange Close was built on the land in 1975.What Audrey would like to know, is when the mills were actually demolished.“I believe it to have been in the late 1970s or early 1980s. I would also like to know when the mills separated to become Gosport Mills and Gosport Old Mills.”Can any reader add any information?
Telcos through their association the Telecommunications Service Providers of Kenya (TESPOK) want more transparency for the Universal Service fund and have now asked the Communications Authority to set up an audit and update them on its status.Collectively, the companies have contributed Ksh. 3.4 billion which is in excess of the CA’s target of sh. 2.5 billion.Apart from the audit, the operators also want to be included in the management of the fund and have also put forward that the last access gap study was outdated and should not be used I determining the areas needing ICT.The daily Nation now reports that the regulator has since not put the money for the intended use and that some contentious issues had not been addressed.“We have not yet been updated on the issue of having private auditors for this fund including the status of a new access gap study,” Tespok Chief Executive Officer Fiona Asonga said in a statement.“We urge the CA to adequately address the pending issues as were earlier raised, before they start administering this fund.”The USF fund is meant to help underserved areas in matters of ICT catch up with the rest of the country and last year it was a topic of discussion as many companies had yet to remit their funds.However, now Safaricom, Airtel, Nation Media Group and Posta, among other operators remitted 0.5 per cent of their gross revenue to the fund.Last year, all stakeholders including Telcos, USF and the CA met and decided to research on the to know the most deserving areas for this money.Telcos, USF board and CA held several meetings last year and agreed that a study would be conducted to ascertain how and where to first apply the funds.“We have established a governance and operational framework, which we will share soon. It focuses on key aspects and principles that guide the authority in its mandate over USF and its relationship with the Universal Service Advisory Council members,” said CA in a statement.
Drama students were left unable to look their lecturer in the eye after she played them a graphic video where she stimulated masturbation with a tampon, writhed around naked and urinated.Lauren Barri Holstein, a PhD student at Queen Mary University, London, showed the students the video, where she blew a condom out of her vagina and inserted a knife between her legs. The clip was shown as part of an introduction presentation to her 'Theatre and its Others' module at Queen Mary University of London.Holstein also gyrated around mid-air whilst dangling naked from a harness suspended from the ceiling. In one scene where she pretends to masturbate with a tampon, she does so over another woman, and sprays fake blood onto her face.The clip was from a recent production Holstein had starred in, which apparently intended to highlight how theatre can incorporate intertextual references and dance, student site The Tab reported.The video can be viewed on Vimeo, but we should warn you - it most definitely isn't suitable for viewing at work. Or in class. Or anywhere public.A syllabus of the theatre class reads: "This module looks at what is specific to the form of theatre, by exploring how to achieve, in theatre, effects and meanings found in other art-forms."It conducts this by means of a practical exploration of the processes and techniques for adapting other material into theatre, supported by relevant readings, screenings, visits and performances as appropriate."It is taught through staff-led workshops, a group practical project and seminar discussion, and is assessed through the group project and two pieces of critical writing."
THE Government is set to pledge £8.3million to fix Plymouth’s pothole-strewn roads.The money, which comes from a successful bid to the Department of Transport’s Local Highways Maintenance Challenge Fund, will go towards an £11.1million project to resurface, dress and patch long stretches of the city’s highways network.Plymouth City Council will make up the additional £2.7million.The city’s bid for a share of the £275million challenge fund was submitted on February 9, and the successful authorities were announced by the DfT this morning.Other councils benefiting from the cash include Blackpool, Bristol, Lancashire, Newcastle, Slough and Wigan.The state of Plymouth’s roads was assessed during a comprehensive survey in 2014.The roads that will be fixed are described as the “key arterial routes” that link the city’s businesses, shops, schools, leisure centres and industrial estates.The scheme also promises improvements to footways, cycle routes and drainage etc.The total estimated cost of the scheme is £11.179m, with the council pledging to contribute £2.794m and £8.385m coming from the DfT.In December last year the DfT pledged £12million over the next six years, which the council said was “nowhere near enough” to fix our crumbling road network.A council spokeswoman said it would cost about £100million to halt the decline of Plymouth’s roads and bring them up to a satisfactory standard.
SWANSEA City have been linked with a move for Portuguese defender Andre Pinto.The 6ft 4in centre-back began his career with Porto and played for a string of clubs in his homeland before joining Greek side Panathinaikos.He returned to Portugal to sign for Braga, and Portuguese newspaper O Jogo claims the 25-year-old's performances there have attracted Swansea's interest.Centre-back is unlikely to be a priority for Garry Monk this summer, although the Swansea boss has said that he intends to strengthen in a number of departments.
FULHAM winger Lyle Della-Verde has dropped the biggest hint that he could be making a welcome return to Bristol Rovers before the loan window shuts this Thursday.The 20-year-old enjoyed a fruitful spell as a loanee for Rovers back in November and went on to make seven appearances before an ankle injury sustained against Wrexham cut his stay short.And now the winger has recently tweeted a picture of himself wearing the famous blue and white quarters, which has set pulses racing among Rovers supporters. Could Della-Verde be on his way back to the Memorial Stadium?

Is it a winner?
New Zealand's Grant Elliott struck the premier South Africa strike bowler Dale Steyn for six to give the World Cup co-hosts a tight four-wicket victory with a ball to spare in their semi-final at Eden Park.Twelve runs were required off the final over of the rain-reduced match after New Zealand had been set a daunting 298 to score off 43 overs.Veteran Daniel Vettori squeezed a four past third man, the pair ran a bye and Elliott hit the winning six over long-on to secure New Zealand's first semi-final victory in seven attempts.They will now meet the winners of Thursday's second semi-final between Australia and India in Sydney in Sunday's final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.Elliott was named the man-of-the-match after his masterly 84 not out from 73 deliveries.Captain Brendon McCullum had set the tone with a brutal 59 from 26 balls, including four sixes.Elliott and Corey Anderson then combined in a fifth wicket partnership of 103 after Martin Guptill (34) had been needlessly run out and Ross Taylor (30) was caught behind.Anderson could have been run out for 33 when he was stranded hopelessly down the pitch at the bowler's end. But South Africa captain AB de Villiers removed the bails without collecting the ball to give him a reprieve.Morne Morkel bowled a potentially telling over when Anderson skied the ball to Faf du Plessis and was out for 58. Luke Ronchi followed for eight but Elliott and Vettori saw their team home to a rapturous reception from the sellout crowd of 41,269.De Villiers (65 not out) and Faf du Plessis (82) laid the foundations of South Africa's impressive 281 for five off 43 overs with a fourth wicket partnership of 103 from 73 balls.David Miller blasted 49 off 18 balls and New Zealand did not help their cause by dropping three catches, none of them easy but all the sort of chances they had been taking in their unbeaten run through the tournament.South African openers Hashim Amla (10) and Quinton de Kock (14) fell cheaply to Trent Boult who broke Geoff Allott's New Zealand record of 20 wickets set at the 1999 World Cup.Rilee Rossouw and du Plessis restored South Africa's fortunes with a third wicket partnership of 83.When McCullum introduced Anderson, the first ball to Rossouw was a wide and the second flew off the shoulder off the bat to backward point where Guptill leaped to his right to hold the catch.Du Plessis reached his half-century from 85 balls and celebrated by lofting Matt Henry straight back over his head for six. De Villiers started to collect boundaries at the other end as the South Africans started to accelerate.The 50 partnership came off 44 balls and De Villiers struck Anderson for 14 runs off three balls immediately after he had been dropped on 38 by Williamson who failed to cling on to a fierce drive.De Villiers was in full flow now before the players left the field after the 38th over with the score on 216 for three when rain blew in over the stadium.After the teams returned Anderson dismissed du Plessis but the New Zealand jubilation was cut short when left-hander Miller climbed into their bowling and 65 came off the final five overs.
MAPUTO — Giant rats may strike fear and disgust into the hearts of homeowners worldwide, but researchers in impoverished Mozambique are improbably turning some of them into heroes.At Eduardo Mondlane University in the capital Maputo, nine giant rats are busy at work — sniffing out tuberculosis-causing bacteria from rows of sputum samples.These are no ordinary rats, as they have undergone six months of training in Tanzania. Their most distinguishing asset is their impeccable sense of smell.Placed inside a glass cage, a rat darts from sample to sample, then stops or rubs its legs, indicating that a sample is infected with a tuberculosis-causing bacteria. Once the task is complete, it is given a treat through a syringe for a job well done."Within 30 minutes, the rat can test close to 100 samples, which normally takes a laboratory technician four days," Apopo tuberculosis programme director Emilio Valverde said. Apopo is the organisation leading the research.The project, which started in February 2013, has brought hope to thousands of tuberculosis sufferers who sometimes receive false results and test negative using the standard laboratory system.In 2006, tuberculosis was declared a national emergency in Mozambique, with 60,000 people in 2014 said to be infected, according to the ministry of health.That number was a 10% increase from 2013.Samples delivered to the university for testing are collected from 15 health centres across Maputo.Belgian group Apopo is planning to expand the programme to other parts of the country, while working on getting the system approved by the World Health Organisation.Apopo claims rat testing is more cost effective than other conventional methods.Each rat costs $6,700-$8,000 to train, with a life span of six to eight years.The cost is lower than rapid diagnostic test GeneXpert, which costs up to $17,000/device, setting the state back between $10 and $17 per test.The kitten-size rats are also used by Apopo to detect landmines by sniffing out explosives.They are light enough to cross terrain without triggering the mines, and are followed by demining experts who reward the rats with bananas.The rats weigh up to 680g and are said to be "easier to catch and train" — according to Mr Valverde.Samples pointed out by the rats to contain tuberculosis bacteria are then sent for further tests using fluorescence microscopy, a more sensitive laboratory technique.The results are sent back to health centres, allowing patients to start treatment early.Although tuberculosis is a treatable disease, in underdeveloped countries like Mozambique it can be deadly if left untreated and is particularly harmful to people living with HIV.Mozambique is one of the countries worst affected by tuberculosis and one in 10 adults is HIV-positive.
Nakuru - National deputy Speaker, Joyce Laboso has said that she is yet to make up her mind on whether to contest for the Bomet governorship in 2017.Speaking Tuesday morning at a Nakuru hotel, Laboso said that even though people want her to go for the seat, she will make the right move at the right time."People have told me they want me to go for the seat but at the moment, I will just focus on discharging my duties as a member of parliament for Sotik and as the deputy Speaker. When time comes for the decision to be made, of course I will definitely do that," she said.Read Also: Bett declares interest in JAP chairmanship, days after joiningLaboso added that she has no bad blood with Bomet Governor, Isaac Ruto, saying that they have a very good working relationship."Governor Rutto is the Governor of Bomet and I respect him and have no differences with him," she said.Last weekend in Kericho County during a rally attended by deputy President William Ruto, politicians present fronted Laboso's name as the possible replacement for Governor Rutto who has seemingly parted ways with the deputy President.For the latest on national news, politics, sport, entertainment and more follow us on Twitter and like our Facebook page!
Two persons have been reportedly killed while six others injured in a clash between the supporters of All Progressive Congress (APC) and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) at Imiegba in Estako East Local Government Area.Witnesses said there were sporadic shootings which led to the killings.It was gathered that trouble started when the SDP Edo North senatorial candidate, Hon Abubakar Momoh was at Imiegba to inaugurate projects when his convoy ran into a campaign rally of the APC canvassing votes for APC candidates.
WASHINGTON – Whether it’s the earnest Josiah Bartlet from The West Wing or the manipulative Frank Underwood in House of Cards, Americans prefer television presidents to their real-life POTUS, President Barack No Drama Obama.  A Reuters-Ipsos poll taken this month, found 54 percent of Americans held an unfavourable opinion of Obama, known for his cool and cautious presidential style, while 46 percent were favourable.  In contrast, asked to imagine that David Palmer of 24 was president, 89 percent of those who had seen the real-time Fox counterterrorism drama said they held a favourable rating of the decisive president played by Dennis Haysbert.  Martin Sheen’s Jed Bartlet of The West Wing, beloved by Democrats, including many who work in Obama’s White House, was rated favourably by 82 percent of its NBC viewers.  In the dark universe of Battlestar Galactica on SyFy, president Laura Roslin, played by Mary McDonnell, drew a 78 percent favourable rating among fans of her quest to find earth and escape the Cylons, a race of humanoid killer robots.  With Americans sharply divided along partisan lines, it is unlikely that any real-life president could achieve sky-high favourability ratings, said Tevi Troy, a presidential historian and author of “What Jefferson Read, Ike Watched, and Obama Tweeted,” a study of popular culture in the White House.  “Pretty much half the country is going to be predisposed against you just because that’s the way we line up with Republicans and Democrats,” Troy said.  Unlike fictional presidents, with their camera-ready looks and perfect timing, real-life presidents sometimes fumble.  Republican Ronald Reagan, who was an actor before turning to politics and eventually becoming president, was an exception, Troy said.  “His media people would say how great it was that he always hit his marks,” said Troy, who was a top domestic policy adviser in Republican George W Bush’s administration.  Morally challenged fictional presidents also topped Obama’s favourability ratings in the Reuters-Ipsos poll.  Of those who watch ABC’s steamy drama Scandal, 60 percent had a favourable view of Fitzgerald Fitz Grant, the philandering, scotch-swilling president played by Tony Goldwyn.  Frank Underwood also beat Obama.  In House of Cards, Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, kills a passed-out congressman by leaving him in a running car in a garage, and pushes a journalist into the path of a subway train.  Imagining Spacey’s scheming character as president, 57 percent of respondents who have seen the Netflix political thriller said they held a favourable opinion of him.  Even Obama likes Underwood. “This guy’s getting a lot of stuff done,” Obama quipped during a December 2013 White House photo-op with Reed Hastings, Netflix’s chief executive.  “I wish things were that ruthlessly efficient,” Obama said.  There was one result from the online poll, conducted from 5 to 19 March, that could give some solace to Obama: He is more popular with Americans than Russian President Vladimir Putin.  Seventy-six percent of Americans had an unfavourable view of Putin, according to the poll, while 24 percent were favourable.
The Black Caps’ dream lives on after they won what must rate as one of the most memorable of all world cup games by four wickets. Grant Elliott, perceived by some to be the weak link in the New Zealand batting, ended a wonderful pulsating semi-final by hitting the penultimate ball of the game from the finest fast bowler on the planet high over wide long-on and into the pulsating heaving stands to set 40 000 people into raptures.As the ball sailed over the boundary, Elliott raised his arms aloft. It was, said the South Africa captain AB de Villiers afterwards, scarcely holding back the tears, the shot of his life. Steyn, who had been treated harshly in previous overs, sank to his haunches in utter despair. Yet again South Africa have fallen at a hurdle they found insurmountable. We said there was nothing between the sides but this was astonishing. Perhaps the magnificent crowd and the support of the entire nation made the crucial difference.This superb match was rain-interrupted at a time that will have benefitted the Kiwis, and was reduced to 43 overs a side, South Africa having made 281 for five. Under the Duckworth-Lewis method, New Zealand were required to make 298 to win, or, technically one fewer because a tie would have taken them through. Elliott ensured that was not necessary, and finished with 84 from 73 balls with seven fours and three sixes.There was a wonderful contribution from Brendon McCullum, whose 59 from 26 balls kick-started the run chase, and from Corey Anderson too, his 58 helping add a fifth-wicket partnership of 103 from 98 balls that resurrected the innings at a time when it seemed that South Africa might take control. Earlier, Faf du Plessis had made 82, AB de Villiers an unbeaten 65 and David Miller a brutal 49 from only 18 balls to see South Africa to what appeared to be a formidable total.New Zealand can now look forward to the trip across the Tasman to Melbourne for the final next Sunday, the first time they will have left the country during this tournament. South Africa can return home with heads held high though. This was no choke. De Villiers has a superb side who on the day were beaten by another of the same calibre.For a chase of this nature, it needed leadership from the front and, almost inevitably it came from McCullum, a man who is close to canonisation in this neck of the woods. McCullum swashed and buckled, hitting Steyn out of the attack and helping add 71 for the first wicket inside seven overs.In the end, two moments changed the course of the match. When he had 33, Anderson, stranded mid-pitch, should have been run out, but de Villiers stumbled over the stumps and fumbled the chance. Then, in the penultimate over, Elliott skied Morne Morkel to deep square leg, where two fielders, Farhaan Behardien and JP Duminy, converged and neither took the chance. These are the pressure situations that define games.Having lost two wickets to Trent Boult and the new ball at the start of the match, South Africa rebuilt their innings superbly. De Villiers sent Rilee Rossouw in at No4 rather than himself, and together he and Du Plessis were able to add 83 before Rossouw was spectacularly caught by Guptill at backward point, after McCullum, searching for something with which to break the stand, brought on Anderson, his fifth bowling change in as many overs at one end.Now though De Villiers was freed from the necessity to mend the early damage, and with Du Plessis anchoring things, he began to play an expansive hand, the pair having added 102 for the fourth wicket by the time the rain began to fall in the middle of the second power play and the players were forced from the field. At that stage, although McCullum persisted with attacking, New Zealand had started to look a little rattled: half-chances had gone down, and a run out missed, so that the break allowed them a chance to regroup, knowing that with De Villiers poised as he was on 60 already, a shortened match would surely suit them more than the opposition.They could not have legislated for what followed however, as for the remaining five overs, the South Africa captain was little more than a spectator as 65 runs were added of which he contributed five. It began when Du Plessis was caught behind off Anderson straight after the resumption, whereupon David Miller set about the bowling with such thunderous strokes that he had made 49 from 18 balls, with six fours and three sixes, before he too edged to the keeper.
In his recent budget the chancellor confirmed plans to make it easier for pensioners who have already bought an annuity to cash it in – exchanging a guaranteed income for life for a cash lump sum they can spend or invest as they wish. The move follows pension freedoms for new pensioners which come into force on 6 April. So is it a good idea?When George Osborne told the 400,000 people who retire every year with an annuity that they could now do whatever they liked with the money, it immediately sparked concerns about a renewed buy-to-let boom. Letting the 5 million people with existing annuities also cash out could turn that boom into a frenzy.Of the first set of reforms, Mark Hayward, of the National Association of Estate Agents, was quoted as saying: “There are no doubts we will see a feeding frenzy … We still have an undersupply of housing and this movement is likely to fuel further house price inflation.”Those concerns will be multiplied many times over should the chancellor’s latest proposals come to fruition.The first barriers will be technical. Already the pensions industry is reeling from the challenge of delivering the reforms announced in the last budget, and many think that the year long timetable for the introduction of the latest pension “freedom” is seriously optimistic.But even if a market in annuities can be created, why should it be permitted? For one thing, vast numbers of pension savers have benefited from tax relief on the basis that they buy a lifetime income. This trade-off almost guaranteed private savers would avoid falling back on the state.For some pension savers that meant a 20% boost to their annual pot while they were working and paying into their scheme. For others, the taxpayer agreed to forgo 40% tax. Make no mistake about how generous these reliefs are. They cost the taxpayer around £34.5bn a year.Neil Lovatt, director at a financial mutual, Scottish Friendly, reckons anyone who thinks they will get a good deal by cashing in an existing annuity is “living in cloud cuckoo land”. But he makes another crucial point about tax. “Allowing annuitants to break the contracts means breaking the ‘generational agreement’ that has shaped the pension industry for years. Namely, that it’s the taxpayer that has paid into the very pension pots which will now be cashed in.“For a pension pot that’s built up over 30 years, it is estimated that around 32% of the money in it will have been generated through tax relief funded by the taxpayer; for higher rate taxpayers the amount funded by taxpayers could be as high as 50%.To a politician concerned with tactical advantage, this will be a sensible move. Osborne’s pension reforms will produce a flood of spending today, not tomorrow, meaning that tax revenues will be boosted in the short term. But he is trading on the financial ignorance of most savers, who at best may pay more tax and end up poorer in later life, and at worst fall prey to all manner of tricksters and fraudsters promising double digit returns on plausible but fictitious investments.Of course the dynamics of old age have changed and so have financial markets. Many people retire and can expect to live another 30 years, not five, which together with the collapse in interest rates and bond yields have sent annuity rates to rock bottom levels.But the answer is a reform of retirement provision and long term care, not pandering to a minority who want to play with their pension pots, probably in the mistaken belief they know what they are doing.If anything, the wealth of many older pensioners should attract extra taxes, to be funnelled back to the young in the form of more generous family benefits, better funded apprenticeships and lower university costs. The economy is already skewed towards the old. Thoughts of reform should focus on the young.Until now, most people were forced to lock their pension fund into an annuity, with no chance to change it. Offering the option to change their mind seems only fair. They will not be forced to, it will be their choice, but it is a choice they are currently denied.Unfortunately, past annuity sales lacked adequate customer protection and many savers paid hefty charges for their original annuity or lost out with poor rates. Of course there is now a risk they will face further costs when selling it on. This is not a reason to deny them the opportunity, but it does mean strict regulatory oversight is vital, with transparency of pricing and possibly controls on charges. Good information, guidance and preferably expert individual advice will be important. The government service Pension Wise can help, but independent financial advice would be better, to explain the tax implications and risks.Allowing people to sell their unwanted annuities at last offers a chance to remedy some of the past mis-selling or mis-buying. Some will take a cash lump sum that better meets their needs than a level income stream, and some will reinvest in a pension drawdown fund and withdraw money later.I expect most people will not sell their annuity, but there are numerous circumstances in which they might consider this. For example, some people had very small pension funds, on top of other pensions, but were forced to annuitise. A £10,000 pension fund could buy less than £10 a week pension, with no inflation or partner protection. This is hardly a life-changing sum, whereas having a few thousand pounds to spend or invest as they wish, perhaps clearing debts, paying for urgent health needs, or investing for the future, could be more useful, especially with other pensions providing ongoing income.The majority of existing annuities were sold on a “single-life” basis, leaving many widows or widowers without provision. Those who unwittingly bought such products would have a chance to retrieve some of their money to ensure support for their partner.This could also affect people with guaranteed annuity rates much higher than current market rates. This attractive income stream was usually only available as a single-life product. Selling this on could allow provision for the partner too.Of course there are risks that selling annuities could compound the damage to people’s pension prospects from the original annuity purchase. However, it can also help mitigate the hitherto irreversible poor customer outcomes of the past.This is rather like giving people the opportunity to change their insurance policy. Standard annuities offer a particular type of insurance for retirement – insurance against the individual purchaser living a very long time and against future interest rate falls. But forcing people to lock their entire pension fund into this insurance leaves customers exposed to other retirement risks, such as inflation, poor health or early death.Selling an annuity is a logical extension to the new pension freedoms and carries similar risks. On balance, I believe it is right to give purchasers who were forced into annuities the chance to change them. They will not have to sell, but offering them the option to do so will help level the playing field between past and future pension savers.
It represents a £27m investment by the firm, which is creating a new meat boning hall and upgrading its production lines.The new posts will be added over the next three years.Jim Dobson, managing director of Dunbia Group said: "Innovation has been at the heart of Dunbia’s success and this investment in new production technology will create a centre of excellence for beef deboning."It will help us to maintain our position as a leading meat processor in the UK and Ireland and to deliver on our growth strategy over the next three to five years."And the workforce expansion comes as the company edged close to a £769m turnover for the year ending March 2014 - up more than £40m on the previous, according to the latest filed annual report.But pre-tax profits for the company fell during the course of the last financial year - dropping by almost £3m to £4.6m.The Dungannon-headquartered company, headed by chief executive and co-founder Jim Dobson, said it made "significant one-off costs" of £1.75m to support winning a contract for a major retailer.The company also snapped up three businesses within a 10-month period.In the last financial year, staff numbers across the firm increased by around 200 - with some 3,256 people working for the processor.Dunbia supplies meat, including beef, lamb and pork, to a range of customers throughout the UK and further afield.Some of its major contracts include supermarket giants Sainbury's and Asda.
For budding archaeologists this is an opportunity where they will learn the mysteries of reconstructing archaeological drawings, sites and historic events or to look at the basics of archaeological artefact identification and handling. In addition there will also be a series of 10 lectures looking specifically at introducing the basics of Archaeology in Scotland.These unique courses are in high demand and once fully subscribed, a waiting list will be initiated, Chris Burgess part of the Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum Project team said: “We are delighted to be able to open up these free courses and lectures to those who have an interest in archaeology and would like to learn more. This is a unique opportunity for people to come along and uncover their hidden talents.”The first free two day course – Flodden Finds Identification - will take place over the weekend of May 11-12 from 10am until 6pm at Birgham Village Hall. The course will be led by Jenny Vaughan and John Nolan, experts in medieval pottery finds.A second free two day course – Archaeological Reconstruction Drawing – will take place later in May, running from 10am to 6pm at Birgham Village Hall. The Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum Project is expecting a high demand and again encourage early booking to avoid disappointment.
In the spring of 2008, months before distracted voters focused on the fall presidential election, several TV reporters ginned up a fake campaign controversy to fill some airtime in the insatiable maw of the 24-hour news cycle.The economy had collapsed, blood still gushed like oil in Iraq. Why, the digital Fourth Estate demanded to know, wasn't the African American senator from Illinois, Barack Obama, wearing an American flag lapel-pin 24/7?The candidate's eventual opponent, John McCain, the white senator from Arizona, wasn't wearing a flag pin at all times either. But only Obama's patriotism was debated by the chattering class. Racial coding, unwitting or intentional, was underway, questioning whether the future president was "one of us.""Trinket" is a monumental 2008 installation sculpture by Newark-born, Chicago-based artist William Pope.L, 59, that put the disheartening display of media-mad political theater into devastating perspective. Centered on Old Glory, its title references the lapel pin.First shown at Grand Arts, a project space in Kansas City, Mo., just weeks before election day, it has now gone on view at the Museum of Contemporary Art's sprawling Geffen warehouse in Little Tokyo. Nearly seven years on, the sculpture still resonates.That's not because it harrumphs over abuse of the United States Code regarding flag etiquette — Chapter 1, Title 4, Section 8 (i) — which states that "the flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever." It doesn't. Pope.L is an artist, not a nitpicking pedant.It resonates deeply, disturbingly and, it should be noted, also enthusiastically. Pope.L takes democratic promise seriously, this sculpture affirms, and he knows as well as anyone that Obama went on to a decisive, 10-million vote election victory. His sculpture is multidimensional — like America itself — not a monolithic polemic."Trinket" is immense. The flag is 16 feet tall, 45 feet long and affixed to a sturdy aluminum pole rising from floor to ceiling.It made me smile. The huge size is a witty representation of the vastness to which modern media's magnifying lens inflated the ludicrous lapel-pin hullabaloo.Pope.L dramatizes the spectacle. (Theater is his specialty.) Four big industrial fans, the special-effects type used in Hollywood to create phony cinematic storms, are positioned near the flagpole.When the fans rev up, the forceful wind lifts the Stars and Stripes and sends the banner billowing. A loud and steady rumble issues from the gale. Banks of klieg lights are sequentially programmed, further cranking up the pageantry.From the sides, the billowing flag is an awesome sight. Rippling, roaring, flashing — it's a thrilling, enveloping spectacle.Walk around behind the whirling fans, however, maintaining your distance from the fiercely spinning blades, and the feeling becomes more sinister. The modern mechanisms of display expose themselves as industrial-strength hocus-pocus. This really is dangerous.Then, when you hike down to the flag's other end, 45 feet away, the wind whipping through your hair almost as furiously as it does through the Stars and Stripes, the experience shifts again. You can feel as if you've been caught up in a disorienting tempest. "Trinket" isn't so benign after all.The stirring sculpture is a media-age abstraction. Nonetheless, it possesses all the vivid fervor of Delacroix's famous figurative painting of "Liberty Leading the People," the flag-waving ode to populist emancipation in 19th century France."Trinket" is technically complex but visually straightforward. It stages a variety of mechanisms that manipulate imagery. Once seen, they're unforgettable.The egalitarian promise of the flag's symbolism is easily acknowledged, but what makes the sculpture great is its layered depth. More difficult to represent is the symbol's power, whose source is counterintuitive: The symbol is dynamic because its egalitarian promise has not been fulfilled.It never can be. Perfection is not ours to claim. Struggle carries on. The promise isn't dead; it's very much alive.Or, as the U.S. Code also declares: "The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing." Jingoism is inert, so this big flag sets it aside.Pope.L added a 51st star to the 50 on the flag. Think of the extra star as representing a state of mind, not territory. Expanding liberation is integral to the national fabric.Rousing celebration also coexists with darker, less festive thoughts. The stripes, for instance, are not completely sewn together at the end of the flag. A uniform emblem unravels into disarray.The flapping red and white banner-strips look like the ones on jaunty advertising balloons attached to motorized blower-fans, which beckon wildly at used-car lots or mattress stores. Commercial consumption rears its head. An implied privatization of public ideals is not pretty.Inescapable is the disparity between the flag's scale, which dwarfs anyone in its vicinity, and the trifle implied by a trinket. Monumentality became a norm in American sculpture in the 1960s, but here it threatens to crush us if we don't take care.Pope.L is perhaps best known for performance works like "The Great White Way." In short segments spread out over nine years, he crawled 22 miles on his stomach from one end of Broadway in Manhattan to the other, wearing a Superman outfit with a skateboard strapped to his back where the cape should be.Endurance works by performance artist Chris Burden, who in 1973 crawled bare-chested through a nighttime field of broken glass in downtown L.A., are one precedent for Pope.L's work. So is Charles Ray, whose nearly invisible 1988 sculpture of a spinning white disk embedded flush into a white wall is evoked by a second Pope.L sculpture at the Geffen: "Blind" is a framed black square on a white wall that, upon closer inspection, turns out to be a black hole. A stiff breeze blows through.MOCA curator Bennett Simpson, who organized the show, added a handful of works. Partly they provide additional context to illuminate the flag piece, and partly they serve the pragmatic need to fill available gallery space. But none is as arresting as "Trinket."One features live people, their faces shrouded behind Methuselah-style white wigs, clambering in slow-motion over white fences. Another arrays tabletop fields of onions, each painted like a fishing bob or semaphore and sprouting greens — new life — as it shrivels in decay.A third is a viewing stand. You climb up and then peer down into a deep square well: A dizzying video-kaleidoscope, made with mirrors, swirls at the bottom.
We all have our quirks, but we it comes to snacking Dean Zahariadis takes the perfectly sliced cake.The 31-year-old, from Pyrmont in Sydney, only ever eats his perfectly-portioned snacks with a knife and fork complete with a napkin tucked under his chin to avoid any mess.A self-confessed control freak, it doesn't bother Dean if he gets strange looks for his bizarre snacking rituals which include cutting all his food into bite-size portions and using cutlery for absolutely everything he eats - even the tiniest of items such as nuts and sultanas.Dean is a structured snacker who admits his obsessive behaviour can become quite tiresome and impact on his everyday life.And it seems he's not the only one obsessed with snacking as new statistics show Australians crave snacking more than spending time between the sheets or cuddles with their partners.Almost two thirds feel the urge to satisfy their stomachs more than their sexual needs with a survey by Wonderful Pistachios revealing that only 49 per cent have the strong desire to be intimate with their loved ones and a mere 39 per cent prefer cuddles over pigging out.Dean, who was diagnosed with a mild case of obsessive compulsive disorder in his first year of university, thinks it's because food is more readily available than sex.But he would still choose being intimate with girlfriend Claire Smith over his structured snacks.'I think it might be a case of we just generally crave food more often than intimacy because it's more readily available and we need to more regularly,' he said.Australian Clinical Psychologist and Mind and Body Expert Leanne Hall said snacking and craving is alluring because it satisfies the pleasure sensors in your brain.'We tend to use it as a way to make us feel good - whereas intimacy can do the same thing but it depends on the partner doesn't it?' she said.'Some people say they would rather a block of chocolate over their partner which is a bit concerning.'Food is a much quicker and easier craving to fix than the urges that go on in the bedroom.'Let's face it, the food doesn't expect anything in return does it?' Ms Hall said.'Whereas snacking just fulfils your need - you don't have to worry about anybody else's needs except your own.'As many as four in five people use snacks as a way to reward themselves or as a form of relaxation, according to a survey of more than 1,000 Australians.Dean admits to feeling very anxious if he can't snack the way he wants to with his particular and precise habits and is only able to relax when everything goes to plan.'If I've been healthy all week I like to treat myself - very occasionally with a chocolate if I feel like I've accomplished something.'But my way of indulging is probably different to most because I usually treat myself with a nut bar or muesli bar which still has sugar in it but some might see that as a more healthy option.'However, as much as Dean is controlled with his healthy snacks, his one 'bad habit' is having a can of Coke Zero with dinner every night.'I find I've become to accustomed to the gas in the soft drink that it actually adds to every meal,' he said.'If I don't have a bit of the drink left to take that last sip at the end of the meal than I don't feel full - that really drives me insane.'The survey results also indicate that Australians are ruled by snacking behaviour with seven in 10 admitting to eating snacks purely because they are giving into a craving.Dean said his obsessive ways can really impact on his life especially where he works as a manager of the Social Brew cafe in Pyrmont.'When I’m serving coffee, I line my cups and saucers up like ducks in a row on the counter which has only manifested in the past six months. If anything is out of place, I have to rearrange it immediately,' he said.'The sweet treat display needs to be immaculately presented and every plate needs to be positioned so it lines up perfectly.'If I’m going to serve a cake or sandwich to a customer, it needs to be cut into a slice that’s exactly 5cm wide.'I think that being a perfectionist actually suits my line of work – no one ever complains about having to tidy up after me.'But he does confess to getting tired of doing the same thing '100 times a day'.'I hate things being moved it drives me insane which can be very exhausting - I'm always thinking "geez this is so tiring",' he said.Meanwhile 45 per cent of Australians confess to secretly stashing their favourite treats to hide them from others - and 41 per cent vow they are prepared to travel up to 10km to fulfill their urge for a particular snack.But at the same time, many won't travel too far without their favourite food as 58 per cent make space for snacks in their suitcases and 48 per cent say they find their trusty treats comforting when away from home.Dean doesn't like to drive without his portion-sized snacks in the car and avoids flying on planes as much as possible because they make him feel 'woozy'.To prove even further that comfort food is the real deal - the number one hot spot to feast on your snacks is while you are cosily tucked up bed for those who were surveyed.But this is certainly not an ideal snacking scenario for Dean who can't bear the thought of his bed getting dirty.Ms Hall said it is essential to break the habit where you like to snack by turning them into snack-free zones and also creating boundaries where food is only to be consumed in the kitchen or dining room.'If you usually snack in front of the TV then don't allow food on the couch so you are addressing those triggers that lead to that mindless eating - which is when we overeat because we are usually focusing on a million things at once,' she said.'If you create those limits then you are less likely to fall in the trap of stashing food in the bedroom or as soon as a movie goes on snacking on popcorn and chips.'
A woman has pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to the murder of William 'Bill' Stevenson.Kerang woman Danielle Kerr, 37, will face a formal plea hearing in May, the Bendigo Advertiser reports.Mr Stevenson, of Kerang, died on Christmas Day 2013 and his partial remains were found in the boot of a burnt-out car in Wellsford Forest on January 2, 2014.Kerr's Supreme Court trial began in Bendigo last Wednesday, but the jury was discharged a day later to allow police investigations to continue.Kerr had originally pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder on the opening day of her trial but guilty to the charge of accessory after the fact.In her opening address, Crown Prosecutor Lesley Taylor told the court that Mr Stevenson, known as Bill, was killed near an isolated gravel road near Kamarooka on December 25, 2013.Ms Taylor told the jury it would hear evidence that on the day Mr Stevenson's died, Kerr said on more than one occasion she wanted to kill Bill.The court heard she had also laughed at one point that there was a movie called Kill Bill.The Crown alleged within hours of saying she would kill him, Kerr bashed Mr Stevenson over the head with a rock, then stabbed him in the face, neck and chest with a hunting knife.The jury then heard how Mr Stevenson had run for his life but was chased down in a car and repeatedly bashed with a branch by Kerr and a co-accused.Ms Taylor said his body was then placed in the car's boot and driven to Wellsford Forest, doused in fuel and set alight.The Crown alleged a pitchfork was used to disperse Mr Stevenson's burnt remains in various locations and that Kerr had said she wanted to have sex with her co-accused beside the dead body.Ms Taylor also told the jury Kerr had denied any involvement or knowledge in the murder and had instead blamed her co-accused, saying she was "powerless to stop him".Judge Terry Forrest discharged the jury on the second morning of the trial to allow police investigations to continue.He told the jury "further investigations have been initiated and those investigations are far from complete".
LONDON - Britain's annual inflation rate slowed sharply to zero in February for the first time, pulled down by falling prices for recreational goods, food, furniture and oil, official data showed Tuesday."The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was unchanged in the year to February 2015, that is, a 12-month rate of 0.0 percent, down from 0.3 percent in January," the Office for National Statistics said in a statement."The main contributions to the slowdown in the rate came from price movements for a range of recreational goods (particularly data processing equipment, books and games, toys & hobbies), food, and furniture and furnishings."Market expectations had been for a CPI rate of 0.1 percent, according to economists polled by Bloomberg.Bank of England (BoE) governor Mark Carney recently warned that inflation could soon turn negative, signalling fresh risks to the economy before a general election on May 7.A sustained period of falling prices can be good for consumers because it means that their wages go further.However, deflation can also trigger a vicious spiral in which companies and households delay their investments and purchases. In turn, that can throttle demand and spark hefty job cuts.The surprise scale of February's fall is likely to push back a BoE interest rate hike, currently pencilled in for 2016, putting downward pressure on the pound.IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer described news of zero inflation as "a serious boost for consumer’s purchasing power".He added: "The Conservatives (and Liberal Democrats) will be pleased to see flat consumer prices in February as any boost to purchasing power is helpful to their hopes that voters will feel happier with their current situation and more inclined to vote for them in May’s general election."Britain's Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government faces the prospect of a closely-fought election on May 7.In power since 2010, Prime Minister David Cameron's right-wing Conservative party is currently neck and neck in polls with the main opposition centre-left Labour party ahead of the vote.
Swedish fashion giant H&M announced a sharp rise in profits Tuesday as the company continues to expand with new outlets and online sales services.The group's net profits surged by 36 percent to 3.61 billion kronor ($425 million, 388 million euros) in the first quarter (December to February) on the back of a 25 percent growth in sales to 40.28 billion kroner."We have made a very good start to 2015," chief executive Karl-Johan Persson said in a statement, adding that the growth was partly due to "strong expansion both through stores and online".During the spring, H&M plans to expand its online retailing service with eight more websites targeting Europe."It is very important to always be able to meet customers? shopping demands and expectations in the fast digitalising development that is taking place in the retail market," said Persson.The company also plans 400 new outlets, mainly in Asia and South America and said it was confident that sales will remain strong despite pressure from a strong dollar."Although the strong US dollar will affect our sourcing costs... we will make sure that we always have the best customer offering in each individual market," said Persson.
DHAKA - Bangladesh officials have summoned Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus over $1.51 million in allegedly unpaid taxes, an official said Tuesday, in what analysts saw as the latest politically motivated move against the micro-credit pioneer.The National Board of Revenue has asked Yunus to resolve the "dispute through discussions" at its office on March 29 in the capital after the economist lodged a court appeal against the unpaid bill."Professor Yunus is a very good and compliant taxpayer. But his total tax dues now stand at 117.7 million taka ($1.51 million)," tax commissioner Meftha Uddin Khan told AFP."We've asked him to settle the dispute through discussions," Khan said.There was no immediate comment from Yunus, who is widely respected among ordinary Bangladeshis as an elder statesman in the impoverished country which is reeling from months of political instability.Yunus, 74, has been at odds with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina since 2007 when he made a brief foray into the country's violent and polarised politics dominated by her family and her arch-rival Khaleda Zia.Yunus was removed in 2011 as head of the micro-lender Grameen Bank that he founded,a move widely seen as orchestrated by Hasina."I think this tax dispute is intended to prove that his integrity is not beyond doubt and he's not as perfect as often ... seen by the public," Ataur Rahman, a retired professor of political science at Dhaka University, told AFP.Khan said taxes must be paid on financial "gifts" from Yunus in the last three years to three trusts set up for his family members and for charitable purposes.But Mahbubur Rahman, a tax adviser of Yunus, said that money should be exempt because they were gifts and a ruling on the matter was pending in the High Court."We think the gift that Professor Yunus has made through his trusts should be exempted from ... tax. He has made an appeal to the High Court against the claim," Rahman told AFP.Yunus set up Grameen Bank in 1983 to make collateral-free micro-loans to rural and mostly women entrepreneurs. Its record in helping to reduce poverty earned him global fame and a Nobel Peace Prize.But Hasina has accused Yunus of "sucking blood" from the poor and in 2013 he faced a state-backed hate campaign seeking to paint him as un-Islamic and a spreader of homosexuality.
President Goodluck Jonathan on Sunday night said though there is corruption in the country it is over celebrated.Jonathan who maintained this position during an interactive session with young professionals in Nigeria and abroad held at Eko Hotel and Suites, Lagos said his administration has done well in the fight against corruption in last four years.Jonathan said, “We know we have corruption issues, but we are over celebrating it,” saying the current distribution of fertilisers through the e-wallet has prevented fraud and also said that inflation of contracts have been reduced in the system.The president added that the oil sector would be fully sanitised in the next four years, noting that the current percentage of poverty in the country stands at 33.1 per cent.The statistics according to him do not really matter but that his administration is committed to ensuring that all Nigerians have the means of feeding.He remarked that there was urgent need to educate Nigerians to end the nation’s poverty, adding that the commitment of the federal government is to prepare the youth to be able to take over the nation’s leadership.The president assured that his administration will give youth more opportunities in his cabinet when reelected and promised to do better in the health sector in the next four years if reelected back to office.
Phillip Boyle and Jamie Blyth had just come home from a few "quiet” drinks at The Southern Cross in Marton, the night before the two found themselves nearly 7,000 miles from England at the popular tourist resort of Pattaya, Gazette Live reports.Packing only a Tesco carrier bag with a few T-shirts and boxer shorts, 33-year-old Mr Boyle was persuaded by Mr Blyth to embark on an impromptu lads break to the beach resort, which lies about 100km from Bangkok.On arrival, the pair met up with a few friends who were already there."It's a last minute bad idea - but one of those bad ideas that turns into a good idea” said Mr Phillips."After lots of jokes, at around 11am the next day with a hangover, Jamie asks if I have my passport handy and comes up with the idea of us going to Thailand straight away."I thought he was joking at first and then he pointed out how there are quite a few lads from Middlesbrough over there we hadn't seen for a while."Then we got into a taxi he'd phoned and - apart from the short delay of picking up Jamie's passport - we were off to Manchester Airport.”Mr Phillips nearly backed out of the trip en route to the airport, thinking it was “all a bit rash” as no flights had been booked.But it soon transpired this was not the first of Mr Blyth’s last-minute getaways, according to the taxi driver. He had previously done four other similar spontaneous trips using the same driver to take him to Manchester Airport."I thought that was hilarious and then said 'okay I'm in'” said Mr Phillips, who travelled on two seven-hour flights with a stopover in Abu Dhabi before arriving in Pattaya. The pair plan to return to Middlesbrough on Tuesday."Some of the lads have serious girlfriends and kids and it's been pretty intense for some of them” he said."I wouldn't like to be facing the grief that some of them will be inevitably going home to”"But no-one's misbehaved to be fair" he added.
The latest inflation figure for the UK revealed record low Consumer Prices Index (CPI) inflation of 0%, while the US figure expected later on Tuesday is expected to show a negligible increase in prices from a year ago.However, both economies are recovering, and well enough that there's an expectation of interest rate rises on the horizon.The normal pattern is for prices to rise alongside economic output. So when the economy is growing, so is demand for goods and services and thus their prices.It's not just GDP, but employment is also expanding. The UK has a record high number of people in work, while US unemployment is falling and expected to recover to the pre-recession rate of 5%, according to the Federal Reserve.There was one other period that required a new term to describe an unusual time.In the 1970s, stagflation referred to high inflation while output was falling - precisely the opposite of what is happening today, but similarly goes against normal economic relationships.The reason then, as now, is oil price shocks.In the 1970s, two wars in the Middle East caused oil prices to shoot up and raise prices, which remained elevated despite slowing economic activity.Since the shocks were external, and there was little capacity for economies like the US to respond domestically, the result was the unusual combination of sustained high inflation during a recession.In the past few years, the UK also saw high inflation despite the worst recession in decades. You may recall that the Bank of England routinely described it as imported price pressure. The governor said that high energy and commodity prices were raising costs and there was zero domestically-generated inflation.Now we have the opposite - there are price movements, but these stem from cheaper imported energy. Oil prices have plummeted since last summer. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) says the UK's record low 0% CPI has been driven by energy prices (motor fuels) falling 16.6% in the past year to February. It's also down to food prices, another sizeable imported commodity, which fell by 3.4%.This means, though, that when volatile elements like energy and food are stripped out of CPI, core inflation is still positive at 1.2%. So, prices are rising and the economy isn't truly deflationary.Still, factory gate prices, or the prices of goods sold by UK manufacturers, are seeing deflation, falling by 1.8% from a year earlier. That eventually feeds through to what we pay in stores. But, so many goods are imported, the more important price indicators are most likely to come from abroad. For instance, China is experiencing low price pressures that will be exported.A little breathing space in terms of the costs of energy, food, and consumer goods is welcome after years of high inflation and below-trend growth.The big question is how worried we should be about deflation. The Bank of England says that any deflation will be temporary. In other words, it's unlikely to be 15 years of falling prices as in Japan.In any case, for now, falling prices while the economy is growing well may warrant a new term. Suggestions are welcome!
Reason to cheer: Rob Green has been recalled to the England squadRob Green admits he would trade his England recall for three points towards QPR's survival scrap.The 35-year-old hasn't played for his country since the friendly win against Norway back in 2012 but was added to Roy Hodgson's squad after Fraser Forster picked up an injury at the weekend.Chris Ramsey's Rangers are embroiled in a battle at the bottom of the Premier League table, with Sunday's home defeat against Everton leaving them four points adrift of safety with eight games remaining.However, the veteran shot-stopper insists keeping the west Londoners in the top flight remains his priority rather than adding to his 12 England caps.“I’d swap it for three points, but it’s obviously nice to get personal recognition. I’d rather be in a team winning games and get recognition for that," Green told QPR's website.“It’s not something I was looking for this season. As goals go, I wanted to be in a team that was competing and staying up, and obviously that is something we can still do.“But it’s obviously pleasing, and you never turn down the chance to play for your country. I will enjoy the week, and learn from it too.”QPR have conceded more Premier League goals than any of their rivals this season, conceding 54 times in just 30 matches.However, Green has been in outstanding form and has produced the most saves (109) in the division.“It’s been a pleasing season for me personally, although I find it difficult to talk like that after a disappointing result," he added.“But as a whole, it’s a season that I have enjoyed playing my part in. We’ve let in far too many goals, but with age you realise that sometimes there is physically only so much you can do."The Everton game was a prime example – I think they had two or three shots on target, and scored twice. That’s the nature of the game.”
Mario Balotelli has taken to Facebook to give his verdict on a Liverpool supporter apparently stopping him from getting involved in a fracas with Chris Smalling at Anfield on Sunday.The Italian clashed with the Manchester United defender in the second half, and was grabbed by a Reds fan as he was getting back to his feet by the touchline.Balotelli posted the image to his Facebook profile, with the caption: "Besides all efforts the game didn’t go our way. But one thing was real clear: I wasn’t alone on the pitch. YNWA."Shaun Leatherbarrow, who has a season ticket in the front row of the Centenary Stand at Anfield, admitted he grabbed the striker as he feared he would get sent off for retaliating to Smalling.He said: “The way I saw it Smalling sort of shoved Mario off the pitch and Mario grabbed him just to have something to grab on to.“I could tell from Mario’s body language he was ready to react and I knew he’d already had a yellow card.“I was saying ‘calm down, leave it, leave it and he was saying ‘OK, OK’.“I’m only 5ft 8in and he’s a big lad so I was struggling to get my arms around him.“Peter, the lad who sits next to me at the ground, helped me and he’s a police officer who sometimes works at Anfield on match days.“Afterwards all the lads were laughing and patting me on the back as well as having a go at Smalling.”United ran out 2-1 winners on the day, giving themselves a five-point cushion over their arch-rivals in the last Champions League place.
Male employees are likely to shun the opportunity for increased paternity leave for fear of being judged, a report claims.Of the 520 men responding to a survey by Huddersfield-based Ramsdens Solicitors, 20% of those working for a business with fewer than 10 employees took two weeks paternity leave for their last child. That compares with 57% of males employed in a large company employing 250 to 999 staff.The Labour Party has announced plans to increase paid paternity leave to four weeks – on a use it or lose it” basis – to financially support new fathers and help them play a more hands-on role in parenting. Labour has also pledged to increase statutory paternity pay from £120 a week to £260 a week.Gareth Dando, head of employment at Ramsdens, said: “Despite the Government extending the right to request flexible working to all employees in 2014 and further changes being implemented in 2015 regarding both partners’ right to take parental leave at the same time, males are still being dissuaded from taking their full paternity allowance and it seems this may be down to the size of the company they work for.”Among employees of micro-businesses who said they would not take extended paternity leave, 16% said that was because they would feel uncomfortable having that much time off work. This compared with only 11% at large businesses.Furthermore, 25% of respondents from micro-businesses said that they would feel unsupported by their boss if they were to take longer than two weeks’ paternity leave, compared with only 5% at bigger firms.Mr Dando said: “This view may be due to them understanding the pressures that their workplace would be under if they were to take more time off to help with childcare.”Some 33% of male micro-business employees believe their colleagues would view them negatively if they were to take more time off, because they would have to pick up the absent employee’s workload.In a large business, where it could be seen as easier to cover for an absence member of staff, 40% thought they would be viewed with indifference against 30% whoe thought they would be viewed positively by fellow employees.
Plenty of people have claimed that weed today is FAR stronger than it used to be – but it’s difficult to get a straight answer, as you have to rely on the testimonies of ageing hippies.But in Colorado, where they’ve recently legalised weed, a science team analysed 600 samples of today’s marijuana compared to results from the Eighties.The team – who test samples before they go on sale in Colorado’s dope shops – admit to being surprised at just how strong today’s skunk actually is.Dope has become three times stronger in the past three decades, they found.Some of the samples from Colorado had more than 30% THC, the active ingredient which gets people stoned – compared to just 10% in the Eighties samples.On average, the samples came out at 18.7% THC.MORE: Someone nearly smuggled enough weed for everyone in the UK to have 2 joints each‘That was higher than expected,’ said Andy LaFrate of testing organisation Charas Scientific.‘It’s common to see samples in the high 20s.’
Euro zone businesses ramped up activity this month, just as the European Central Bank starts printing money to spur growth and inflation, while a slowdown among Chinese factories has fuelled calls for more stimulus there.A disappointing Chinese survey of manufacturing added to signs the world’s second biggest economy has lost momentum despite two interest rate cuts since November, alongside other policy easing measures.By contrast, Tuesday’s surveys showed signs of an economic pickup in the troubled euro zone, just as ECB policymakers unleash a roughly 1 trillion euro quantitative easing plan.“I wouldn’t want to give QE too much credence at this stage. The ECB has only been buying for a couple of weeks and QE takes a long time to have any impact – if at all,” said Peter Dixon at Commerzbank.“The outright QE itself has had zero impact, growth was already happening.”Markit’s Eurozone Composite Flash Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), based on surveys of thousands of companies and seen as a good growth indicator, jumped to a near four-year high of 54.1 from February’s 53.3.That beat the highest prediction in a Reuters poll – well above the median forecast for a modest rise to 53.6 – and was its 21st month above the 50 level that separates growth from contraction.The surveys pointed to first-quarter growth of 0.3 per cent, Markit said, matching the previous three months but shy of the 0.4 per cent median forecast in a Reuters poll taken earlier this month.A sub-index measuring prices charged rose to an eight-month high of 49.0, but it has now spent three years below the breakeven level, suggesting inflation won’t be making any sudden leaps from February’s –0.3 per cent.Oil prices have tumbled over the past nine months and inflation rates across the world have followed suit. Data from Britain earlier on Tuesday showed prices didn’t move last month for the first time on record.With little, if any, upward pressure on prices economists may push further back forecasts for when the Bank of England – which was once expected to be the first major central bank to tighten policy – finally hikes borrowing costs.“The risks to our inflation calls are firmly on the downside, which raises the risk that the BoE delays rate hikes even further,” said Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank.European shares and the euro edged up after the surveys but the slowdown in China kept oil and commodities-linked assets under pressure.A similar survey due later on Tuesday is expected to show a slight tick down in factory growth in the United States, the world’s biggest economy.China’s flash HSBC/Markit PMI dipped to 49.2 in March, confounding the expectations of economists polled by Reuters who had forecast a very modest dip to 50.6 from February’s final PMI of 50.7.Some analysts already expected first-quarter economic growth to slip below the government’s new full-year target of 7 per cent – widely seen as the level needed to keep employment steady.“The deteriorating PMI confirmed that downside risks to China’s 2015 growth have started to materialise. We expect an accelerated monetary easing cycle and somewhat loosening of the fiscal stance,” said Jian Chang at Barclays.China’s economy faces increased downward pressure this year but the slowdown is stabilising, with employment and services among the bright spots, Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli said on Sunday.The country’s leaders have said they would be willing to tolerate somewhat slower growth as long as the labour market remained resilient, but the latest PMI employment sub-index contracted for a 17th straight month, hitting its lowest since the depths of the global financial crisis.

Crimean Tatars are in danger of being totally wiped out from their ancestral lands, warned Refat Chubarov, the of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis (Parliament).Chubarov told the Subcommittee on Security and Defence of the EU parliament on Tuesday that Moscow's attempt to russify the territory since it annexed it from Ukraine last year has led to systematic violations of Tatars' rights, including closing down Tatar schools and businesses.Chubarov said he feard all Tatars could be deported, as it already happened during the Second World War. Deported en masse to Central Asia by the Soviets 70 years ago, the Tatars began returning to Crimea in the 1980s to rebuild their lives in an independent Ukraine.The Tatars' self-ruling body, the Mejlis, which was disbanded by Russian authorities but still operates outside Crimea, has urged the Tatars to stay in Crimea and maintain their homeland.Last Thursday, Crimean Tatar leader Mustafa Dzhemilev had also urged the West to maintain strong sanctions against Russiațs annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula to pressure the Russian "aggressors" to leave without using military force.Dzhemilev, who was barred from Crimea after the Russian takeover, warned that "if the war starts in Crimea it will mean the extermination of the entire Crimean Tatar population in Crimea."He told a news conference before an informal briefing to the U.N. Security Council that he remains in contact with dozens of people in the 280,000-member Muslim Tatar community still living there who say life is now as bad or worse than it was under the Soviet Union.Dzhemilev last week, as well as Chubarov today in Brussels, called last year's referendum that led to Russia's annexation "fake" and said that according to recent sociological surveys, only 20 % of Crimea's population would vote in favor of joining Russia if a referendum was held now.The Tatar leaders painted a grim picture of people in Crimea seeking to remain part of Ukraine being repressed, of more than 4,000 businesses closing down and being taken over by "so-called self-defense groups," and of "very tense" inter-ethnic and inter-religious relations."Violations of human rights are flagrant and they have overpowered those taking place during the Soviet era," he told reporters after the briefing.Tatar leaders lament that Crimea used to be a popular tourist area but is now "being turned into a military base." State-of-the art Russian Iskander rockets are reportedly being transferred to a site near Yalta that was a nuclear base before Ukraine renounced nuclear weapons in 1994.The European Union repeated last week it would stick to its policy of not recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea and voiced concern over what it said was a military build-up and deteriorating human rights situation there."The European Union does not recognize and continues to condemn this act of violation of international law," EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said in a statement marking the anniversary of Russia's annexation off the Ukrainian region.She said the EU would remain committed to its policy of not recognizing the annexation, including through sanctions.
As preparations for the 2015 general elections approach the home stretch, Nigerian celebrities are also ready to fully partake in the process of deciding the leaders that will take up the nation’s affairs for the next four years.One of such celebrities, who, unlike her colleagues that have been busy campaigning for different candidates, has decided to actively participate in ensuring that the process is free and fair is Bimbo Akintola, as she has just been accredited as a Celebrities election observer.Akintola shared her ID as a ‘Celebrity Election Observer’ on Instagram with the caption ‘#freenfairelection #violencefreeelections.
As political parties prepare for the final lap of the Presidential and National Assembly elections, former national chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Dr Bamanga Tukur, has tasked politicians in the country to act in accordance with the with electoral laws and discourage the resort to violence.Tukur, who made the appeal yesterday when he hosted top politicians at his residence in Abuja, said ‎while election is a process through which the people choose their leaders, it also is serves an opportunity for the people to make decisions over who should rule them or control the affairs of Government within a given period.He stressed that politicians should appreciate that by contesting elections, they are merely offering themselves for services to the people.“All final campaigns should be devoid of hate, violence, bitterness and calumny.“All right thinking Nigerians should condemn any campaign of hatred and rancor, for it is at variance with the tenets of liberal and constitutional democracy, which we practice in the country” Tukur said.He added that it is the duty of the people to choose their leaders explaining that people should not see elections as a do or die affair.According to Tukur, such an exercise in sincere terms need no reason to be filled with rancor, recrimination, bitterness, acrimony or violence.He therefore emphasized that Nigerians from all works of life need peace adding that the Nation deserve peace and stability to be able to move to the next level.Dr. Tukur further advised that all the political parties in the country should adhere to and heed the terms of the peace accord voluntarily entered into by all the political parties.
More babies have been made, but will they have a school to go to? Photo: Peasap/FlickrParents have made more babies in northern Jutland as requested by local politicians but their efforts may have been for naught as area schools may still close down.In November, Thisted Council brokered a deal with area parents in which the municipality agreed to keep area institutions alive for the next four years if parents would  in turn get busy creating new children to fill the institutions.The parents have dutifully done their part between the sheets according to the local hospital, which reports that area pregnancies have increased by a third since November.But hopefully parents found the act itself reward enough because now officials are threatening to back out of the arrangement.Broadcaster DR reports that the Danish People’s Party has withdrawn its support for the plan in the midst of intense political debate over the number of asylum seekers in the area.“I think it is really disappointing that the passionate work and commitment we have seen from residents is now being completely burnt,” Social Democrat spokeswoman Ulla Vestergaard told DR.“No one has any idea right now what will happen with these schools and institutions,” she added.

The 1950s and 1960s star - and the first black South African to play in Europe who was compared to world greats - died four days short of his 83rd birthday in Baltimore, Maryland.Safa president Danny Jordaan said yesterday the news came as a "big shock"."We have lost one of the biggest legends in the history of South African football," Jordaan said."He went to Europe when it was very difficult, not just for a South African, but for an African to do that. Considering he matched the best in the world, he showed what we had always believed was correct - that every human being is equal."I don't think he was always appreciated like he should have been in SA. If you speak about him in the Netherlands you appreciate how big a hero he really was. Kalamazoo was one of the country's best exports. A legend has been lost."Jordaan said he was due to travel to Washington in May for a ceremony honouring Mokone. "I will have to contact his wife to see if we can arrange a memorial in SA."Mokone's wife, Louise, said the former footballer died just after his step-son Ronnie arrived in Baltimore."I would like to have a memorial in SA. I will speak to Danny about it because I'd like it to be related to sports in some way, " Louise Mokone said from Baltimore yesterday."Steve wanted his ashes brought back to SA and spilled on a soccer field. But not immediately because he requested his body be used for research."I have his trophies and memorabilia and would like to start a museum in SA, but don't know how to."Sports Minister Fikile Mbalula said in a statement: "As a nation, we have lost a legend."Mokone's clubs included Durban Bush Bucks, Coventry City, Heracles in Holland and Torino in Italy. He was compared to the world bests, such as Pele and Stanley Matthews, and had a street named after him in Amsterdam.

A family run Wolverhampton-based firm that is celebrating 45 years in the building industry has ordered a new fleet of trucks to cope with demand for its environmentally friendly services.Specialist environment contractor The McAuliffe Group, which works on rejuvenating brownfield sites for new housing projects, says it has doubled its turnover during the last two years.The company at Loxdale Industrial Estate, Northcott Road, has responded by ordering eight new tipper trucks and a heavy-duty low loader vehicle from The Hartshorne Group, which operates nine Volvo dealerships across the Midlands.Director Steve McAuliffe said: “The reason we have brought in new trucks is to cope with demand for our services from the construction industry.“We’ve taken the bull by the horns by investing and it’s going well for us. It’s very timely because we are in our 45th year of doing business.”The company was founded in 1970 by Steve’s father, Maurice McAuliffe, who started off with a single JCB digger. The firm now operates extensive plant and machinery and recently increased its staff to around 70.“We do lots of work with major housing companies and if they buy an old factory site we will go in and re-profile the land from start to finish.“We demolish the old buildings and remove any waste so that the ground workers can go in and build new homes.“We recycle everything that we pull down and we also clean up sites by doing decontamination work. Environmental issues are very important to us,” said Mr McAuliffe.The waste materials that are recovered by McAuliffe are converted into aggregates and building materials. The company also has state-of-the art pumping equipment that can remove spillages from soil.McAuliffe has been running Volvos since the 70s and Mr McAulife says he favours the vehicles because they retain a strong re-sale value. The new trucks are latest shape FM models with Powertronic automatic gearboxes. They meet latest emissions standards and will be used on a number of green projects.Shaun Robson, truck sales executive at The Hartshorne Group in Birmingham, said: “We’d like to be the first to congratulate the McAuliffe Group on its 45th anniversary.“We’re very proud to be working with a such a well-established company that is committed to being environmentally friendly.”McAuliffe’s directors are all members of the McAuliffe family, who are devoted to running the business. “We are here from 7 o’clock in the morning and if we have to work until 8 o’clock at night, we do,” said Mr McAuliffe.“We give customers what they want and they knew that when they ring our company they can speak directly to me or to one of the other directors.“The company has been going for 45 years but we are still hands-on – and customers like that.”
Diego Costa has been ruled out of Spain's upcoming matches against Ukraine and Holland with a hamstring injury.The Chelsea striker was substituted with 15 minutes remaining during Sunday's 3-2 win at Hull and Spain on Tuesday announced that he would return to the Premier League club for treatment during the international break.A statement on Spain's official website read: "Diego Costa, left the premises of the Spanish Football Federation this morning after undergoing several tests with the medical services of the RFEF."The striker has suffered a level 1 hamstring tear on the biceps femoris of the left thigh, which was previously already noted by the medical services of his club."The statement continued: "Diego Costa will return to Chelsea FC where he will undergo the corresponding medical treatment."The 26-year-old scored his 20th goal of the season with a wonderful curling effort to put the Blues 2-0 up on Sunday, but he hobbled off before Loic Remy came off the bench to secure the win for Jose Mourinho's side.The Chelsea boss said afterwards that extra care has to be taken with his star striker when it comes to his hamstring."When a striker is playing, the team needs a goal to win the game and with 15 minutes to go the striker, a guy with a lot of experience of hamstring injuries, says 'it is over for me', then it is over for him," Mourinho said."He has this problem. He tried to play the Champions League final for Atletico (Madrid, last season) and was injured again and again and again. He has this fragility."We know his hamstring is not a strong one. He works hard through the week to compensate the weakness he has there but the injury can come."Vincente del Bosque's side face Ukraine on Friday in European Championship qualifying group C, where they currently sit second three points behind leaders Slovakia before taking on Holland in a friendly next Tuesday.

In October 2012, Elisa Lopez was sexually assaulted while napping on a subway train in New York City, and the entire incident was caught on video and spread online like wildfire.Late last week, more than two years after the shocking attack, Ms Lopez was finally vindicated when police apprehended her alleged molester, identified as 43-year-old Carlos Chuva.The Queens resident was arrested last Thursday and charged with first-degree felony aggravated sexual assault.According to a criminal complaint cited by Gothamist, the suspect admitted that he was the attacker when officers showed a screen grab from the infamous subway video.The vile attack took place at around 4am October 20, 2012, aboard a downtown 4 train near Lexington Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan.Elisa Lopez, then a 21-year-old member of the Air National Guard, was on her way downtown to meet her boyfriend after attending a party in The Bronx when she briefly dozed off on the train, instinctively clutching her purse.She woke up moments later to discover a stranger caressing her thigh and face and trying to kiss her.The terrified straphanger punched the pervert in the face and fled the subway.She did not realize the extent of the sexual assault she had endured until a work friend sent her the graphic video shot by a fellow passenger aboard the 4 train.The grainy cell phone footage recorded by Brooklyn man Jasheem Smiley depicts a middle-aged man dressed in a faded denim jacket and jeans shoving his hand under the sleeping woman's skirt and groping her.The 18-second clip of the attack quickly went viral, earning Smiley public censure for capturing the assault on his iPhone instead of trying to stop it.Smiley released another video on his YouTube channel just days later defending his actions that night.‘There were 10 other people on the train that didn't do anything,’ he explained. ‘I was the one that did the most.’Smiley pointed out that after the groper got off the train, he notified the conductor about what happened and went to the police with the video.But according to the man, officers became interested in the case only after he uploaded the footage online and it attracted media attention.The assault witness explained that had he physically intervened, the suspect could have accused him of attacking him without any provocation.Smiley also claimed he was concerned for his own safety because he did not known if the middle-aged pervert had a gun or a knife or him.‘God knows I did the best I can,’ he said in the video.He did mention that he repeatedly tried waking Lopez, but the woman continued sleeping after a night out drinking with friends.On her part, Elisa Lopez broke her silence about the attack this past December, telling Cosmopolitan that she was in disbelief when she first saw Smiley's footage.‘I felt sick to my stomach. I was yelling, screaming. I was hysterical,’ she recalled.Determined to see her abuser behind bars, Lopez released a video of her own explaining the circumstances of the attack and launched a Facebook campaign appealing to fellow users for help in bringing the subway groper to justice.Lopez said she has been grappling with post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and night terrors for the past two years. She also cannot bear using the subway.Initially, she was hesitant to seek psychological treatment for fear of being ejected from the Air National Guard, but after realizing she was having suicidal thoughts, Lopez decided to go and find herself a therapist.She also turned to art to help her cope with the trauma and adopted a puppy and a calico kitten. She is currently enrolled in the City College of New York.In an interview with Pix11 about Carlos Chuva’s long-awaited arrest, Lopez suggested she now has come full circle, more than two years after the night that changed her life.‘I'm at a point where i can say that i am ready to move forward with this,’ she said with a smile.
A plane carrying 142 passengers and six crew has crashed in the southern French Alps en route from Spain to Germany.The Airbus A320 was flying from Barcelona to Dusseldorf when it disappeared from radar in the Alpes de Hautes Provence after sending a distress signal at 10.47am local time (9.47am GMT).French president Francois Hollande said that he did not expect there to be any survivors.Debris from the jet, operated by Lufthansa's Germanwings budget airline, was found near Barcelonnette, according to the French Interior Ministry.French Prime Minister Manuel Valls said he understood between 142 and 150 people were on board and feared dead.'The cause is at present unknown,' he told reporters.Police helicopters were circling the crash remains, many of which were located at Barcellonette.A spokesman for the DGAC aviation authority said the airplane crashed near the town of Barcelonnette about 100 km (65 miles) north of the French Riviera city of Nice.According to flight data from FlightAware 24, at 09:30 UTC (10.30 GMT) the aircraft was cruising at 38,000 feet at 463 kts.It started losing altitude to 37,975 by 10.31 with the speed reportedly increasing to 477kts.But 10.41 the last reported radar returns had the aircraft descending at 6,800 feet at 378kts.In ten minutes the aircraft plunged 31,200 feet in just ten minutes.Lufthansa's Germanwings unit said it was as yet unable to verify reports of the crash.The company tweeted: 'We have recently become aware of media reports speculating on an incident though we still do not have any own confirmed information.'The crashed A320 is 24 years old and has been with the parent Lufthansa group since 1991, according to online database airfleets.net.The local La Provence newspaper said the Airbus A320 was carrying 142 passengers, two pilots and four cabin crew, citing aviation officials.Lufthansa were not immediately available for a comment. Airbus had no immediate comment.Germanwings today is the low-cost subsidiary of German national carrier Lufthansa, and was first branded in 2002. The company’s history can be dated back to 1997, however, when it was known as Eurowings.The airline’s main hubs are at Cologne Bonn Airport, Stuttgart Airport, Hamburg Airport, Berlin Tegel Airport and Dusseldorf Airport with further bases are Hannover Airport and Dortmund Airport.Lufthansa have announced that Cologne-based Germanwings will be going back to its roots and re-branding back to Eurowings in autumn this year.There are a total of 81 aircraft in Germanwings’ fleet, with an average of 9.2 years, flying to 86 destinations around the world. The fleet includes the Airbus A319, Airbus A320 and the Bombardier CRJ900.There had never been a fatal crash in Germanwings’ history until the reports of today’s tragedy.Back in December 2010, a Germanwings flight was said to be ‘moments from crashing’ after the pilots were overcome with fumes on landing at Cologne.The plane had 150 passengers on board, and officials accused Germanwings of ‘playing down the incident’ to ‘avoid investigation’.
New Earswick Primary School head teacher Carole Dickson receives the Best Primary School Project award from Dave Clarke, of Yorwaste, at the Community Pride AwardsPARENTS, pupils and teachers in York have been urged to nominate the primary school projects which have made a real difference.The Press Community Pride Awards celebrate the city’s unsung heroes, who go above and beyond the call of duty to improve their community.The Best Primary School Project – for projects which have improved their surroundings and the environment – is sponsored by waste management company Yorwaste.Last year's winner was New Earswick Primary School with Yearsley Grove Primary School and Haxby Road Academy as runners up.Dave Clarke, Yorwaste transport customer service manager, said: “Yorwaste has sponsored the best primary school project for a number of years and we never cease to be amazed by the high standard of entries which are submitted by children in York.“We were particularly impressed with New Earswick Primary School’s winning project last year which not only involved the children cleaning up the village, but also tackling their older brothers and sisters at the secondary school over the mess left on the village green.“We believe strongly that if we stress to young people at a very early age the importance of looking after the environment, then this will have a positive impact in the future.”Last year New Earswick Primary School's project was deemed to have made the most difference by judges.Headteacher Carole Dickson said the project had been really well supported by people in the village, and had made a long-lasting difference to the area.She added: "We have been absolutely delighted with the support from the village, and our secondary school Joseph Rowntree, and we want to say a big thanks to them."I think there's a greater awareness now amongst the children that there is something they can do about litter."The Community Pride Awards are run in partnership with City of York Council. The main sponsor is Benenden.To nominate or for more information go to yorkpress.co.uk/pride.
What a pleasant change – a footballer putting up his hand and admitting he deserved to be sent off!Steven Gerrard (who from my ITV days I always considered a class act) came straight on Sky Sports after being sent off in Sunday’s home match at Anfield and apologised to his manager, team and supporters for arguably costing Liverpool the match against Manchester United.Gerrard, in his last season at Liverpool, went on as a substitute at half-time with United 1-0 up – just 38 seconds later he was sent off for stamping on Manchester United’s Ander Herrera’s ankle.Liverpool's Steven Gerrard remonstrates with referee Martin Atkinson after being sent offManager Brendan Rodgers accepted Gerrard’s apology. His club captain admitted: “I’ve got to accept it. The decision was right. I think I tried to avoid his tackle and I have reacted when I’ve seen his studs showing”Gerrard’s apology came after he asked to be interviewed Sky Sports who were covering the match live. A stupid, costly sending-off but I admire him for accepting the blame – often not the case in football.I am fed up to the back teeth of players and managers always blaming the referee.Managers are particularly bad at this – it’s often to deflect blame which should be aimed at their players or even themselves. And if it’s not the referee it’s often the media!I cannot remember officials or the media missing tackles, goals or making bad back passes! Sure they make mistakes, but not as many as the players!Jose Mourinho has made what I believe to be an unwarranted attack on two of my Sky colleagues, Graeme Souness and Jamie Carragher, after their Chelsea’s recent exit from Europe. It was surely to deflect Chelsea’s shortcomings in this particular match.Chelsea are enjoying a fine season. League Cup won on March 1 in the final against Spurs, the Premier League title almost in the bag as they are six points clear with a game in hand. Out of the FA Cup in a shock defeat; knocked out of the European Champions League by Paris St. Germain who had ten players for most of the second leg at Stamford Bridge in the second leg.Now Jose is a terrific manager in lots of ways – successful, charismatic, unpredictable, fascinating, bi-lingual and, the ladies tell me, good looking. Not bad for a man who started out as an interpreter for the late Sir Bobby Robson at Barcelona.He became a coach under Louis van Gaal at the Nou Camp, then assisted Jupp Heynckes at Benfica before stepping up at the age of 37 to be Benfica’s manager. He has since won so much.At Porto he won the European Champions League, the UEFA Cup, the Portuguese League(twice), the Portuguese Cup and Super Cup. Then with Chelsea the Premier League (twice), the League Cup (three times), the FA Cup and the Community Shield. His time at Inter Milan brought the European Champions League, the Italian League (twice) the Coppa Italian Cup and the Italian Super Cup and, when at Read Madrid, the Spanish League, Copa del Rey and the Spanish Super Cup.But it seems TV pundits are not allowed an opinion. That was certainly the case after this season’s European Champions League exit.Mourinho said he could not compare his playing career with Souness. Jose pointed upwards. But as managers Mourinho pointed downwards about Souness: “He is clearly a frustrated man,” added the Chelsea manager.This is not true. I have known Souness both as a player and manager, something Mourinho has not.In my opinion he is the best TV football pundit – I know I am biased but I really believe Sky have the best these days. Fearless, outspoken with honest opinions about current players.In that second leg Souness described the Chelsea players as pathetic for surrounding the referee who then sent off Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Jamie Carragher, working alongside Souness, said it was disgraceful and Mourinho’s team would never be loved. For my money they were smack on!Mourinho, in his bizarre way, blamed diets and maybe the quality of products we are eating for memories getting shorter. He said that because when these two spoke about it Jose said they had a problem for sure!Jamie, he continued “stopped playing a couple of years ago and in two years forgot everything he knew.”He then attacked Souness’s time at Benfica and reminded us it was a long time since he played but added “he was a fantastic player.”Signficantly Mourinho did not directly answer a question about whether he would ever instruct his players to pressurise a referee but did explain that the players would collectively pay any fine for their collective on field behaviour.We just have to take his word for it and we will never know outside the club.I spent the Cheltenham Festival working for Eventmasters interviewing Champion National Hunt legend AP McCoy both before and after racing each days.There will never be another jump jockey like him. He is retiring from the saddle at the end of the season. He has not fixed a date yet but I would expect it to be after the Grand National at Aintree on April 11.I featured AP as one of my Sporting Heroes subjects on Sky Sports. He is obsessed with winning rides. Nothing else has mattered.He was very professional in our talks and previews at Cheltenham but clearly his mood is determined by results, and one winner throughout the four days of the Festival was not great. However he did select some winners for the clients!I really like AP McCoy. What will he do in retirement? My guess is he will prepare for a future as racing manager for his retainer, the great owner JP McManus.But it is all close to his chest at present. One thing is for sure, he will not train horses.
A former Lagos State governor and National Leader of the All Progressive Congress, APC, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu has called on Nigerians to see the forthcoming general elections as a common sense revolution they need to seize to effect the changes needed through their Permanent Voters Cards, PVCs.Tinubu stated this in Kano on Monday evening while speaking with reporters shortly after commissioning the Kano Corporate Security Institute and a number of other projects executed by Governor Rab’u Musa Kwankwaso’s administration. He urged Nigerians to come out en masse to vote for credible leaders.Calling on Nigerians to vote for the APC, Tinubu said it is the only way the country can be rescued from socio-economnic and political quagmire brought about by the poor leadership of the ruling Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, led by President Goodluck Jonathan.Tinubu said: “My message is that they should see the forthcoming election as a common sense revolution; common sense revolution to reform, re-change, get relieve, security of lives and property, eliminate corruption, and deception, recovery of the economy.”Continuing, the APC chieftain said: “This is the first nation that is moved from the platoon of economic prosperity. For oil to be selling at the highest price per barrel ever experienced in the world and to plummet to below 50 per cent and taking the country to recession at the same time; and if you cast your mind back to some few years back, various governors of this country and the entire population are being deceived about the excess crude.”“You said you want to save for the rainy day, they say we are saving for sovereign wealth—if there is a save for sovereign wealth and if there is a save for the rainy day—Is it not a Tsunami now to move from exchange rate of 110 to 210, 220?“What is the position of our foreign reserve, where is the savings as regards to the rainy day from the excess crude oil account? Where is the sovereign wealth and how much are they spending to support the Naira every week?“Why did they have a U-turn and move away from what they called the Dutch auction and the manufacturers that will keep the economy buoyant and going are not being supported because they are having a low foreign exchange to even support the factory and the manufacturing industries? Those are the areas that Nigerians will have to shine their eyes, be determined and create the revolution with their PVC. Please vote for change.”The former Lagos State governor, however, praised Kwankwaso for what he described as the unique development going on in Kano under his administration, adding that he was not only impressed but proud that such experience is coming from an APC governor.“What I discovered today during the commissioning is the fact that security and the training is giving priority; and not just an ordinary priority in the area of just human prospects, but organizing a society, building a society to have confidence in themselves and being trained in modern day-to-day challenges of our modern time, which will bring a lot of economic development.“We all know that without security, there can be no direct foreign investment and economic progress in any society. In a state like Kano—that is a very large state, with a high population density, vehicular density, industrialization is very important; and to have to educate and develop the skill of those who are to provide security, intelligence information and be able to cope with those challenges, the far-sightedness of the government—in the long-run, Kano has been lucky.“I am extremely not only impressed but I am very proud that we have a vision, a commitment for a vision and sincere value in this government under Rabi’u Musa Kwankwaso,” he concluded.
FORMER BBC presenter Phil Sayer admits he is lucky to be alive after surviving a major health scare.He bravely took part in last year's Great Manchester Run despite being told on the eve of the event that he had oesophageal cancer.After undergoing surgery and two intensive course of chemotherapy treatment, he is determined to be back on the start line for this year's 10k challenge on Sunday, May 10.It will be a poignant appearance for Phil and wife Elinor Hamilton, from Bradshaw, after coming through the ordeal.Phil was a DJ at Piccadilly Radio and BBC Radio Manchester for many years and a familiar face on TV reading regional news bulletins.He said: "This type of cancer is often without obvious symptoms until it’s very advanced. To be honest I'd never felt better, yet there was cancer in there."If it is diagnosed too late, then surgery is no longer an option. Mine seems to have been caught just in time. The surgical procedure — around eight hours on the operating table — involves removing much of the food pipe and part of the stomach. "He was also fortunate his voice, which is his living, was not affected, though there was a risk of damage.Phil and Elinor are both voice-over artists.They record radio and television commercials, e-learning projects and other spoken-word audio from their own studio.Additionally, Phil records the automated announcements used on hundreds of railway stations across the UK, while Elinor's voice is heard over the PA system on the London Underground.Phil added: "The 10k is a big challenge and I'll try to run it, but I just want to get round from beginning to end. It's great to be here a year down the line with every confidence I've still got a future."Nine-year-old twin sons Alex and Ben are also doing their bit by taking part in the two-mile Junior Run in Heaton Park on Saturday May 9.The family is raising funds for The Oesophageal Patients' Association (OPA) highlighting the work of the charity which supports and re-assures patients.The OPA plans to help many more patients as it celebrates its 30th anniversary.Oesophageal cancer is the fifth most common cancer with 12,900 people diagnosed each year.To sponsor Phil and Elinor go to www.justgiving.com/teamcliftypops2.To enter the Morrisons Great Manchester Run go to www.greatrun.org/Manchester.
HOMEOWNERS that suffered from local flooding in from April 2013 to March 2014 could benefit from £5,000 of Government funding to help protect their homes.The council’s cabinet approved recommendations last night that could help up to 300 Southend-on-Sea homeowners and businesses access funds to carry out flood protection works. Full Council will now discuss the recommendations on Thursday.The council will underwrite the costs of administering and delivering the scheme (£500 per property or up to £150,000 for administration and up to £1.5m for the actual works) which will pay for expert external assistance to help local homeowners and businesses take up the grant, arrange bulk-buying and oversee the contracts and installation of flood resilience measures to the value of £5,000.The council will use Government grants to cover the administration and costs of the works, but needs to underwrite the costs at this stage. The delivery of the scheme would be carried out by the council’s appointed consultant for Flood Risk Management issues, URS.URS will now write to 300 properties where internal flooding is known to have occurred within this period, telling them more about the scheme and assistance available and about financial relief that they could also be eligible for.Martin Terry, councillor for public protection, waste and transport, said: “Anyone who has been affected by flooding will know how distressing the experience can be, even without the added anxiety of how you will pay for the damage and protect your property in future. For many local residents, this repairs grant and support scheme could offer some measure of financial relief and add resilience to their homes or places of work, so that they’re better protected and have greater peace of mind if similar floods occur in future.“In the last couple of years, I’ve met countless people whose lives were shaken by unprecedented flash flooding – from pensioners whose homes have been inundated to businesses whose trade has been significantly damaged. That’s why I want to ensure that everyone who is eligible to receive financial relief or access grant to protect their properties has a fair opportunity to stake their claim.”In November last year, the Council encouraged residents and businesses in known flooding hotspots to report flooding incidents to them. Now the Council is now making contact with these respondents and all other know flooding victims to ensure that as many affected people as possible are aware of the application process and are able to apply for relief.For more information or if you believe you could also be eligible for a grant please visit www.southend.gov.uk/flooding or email council@southend.gov.uk
We are all set for the penultimate stage in the mega event. New Zealand take on South Africa in the first semi final of the World Cup 2015 from Auckland.
Britain’s annual inflation rate slowed sharply to zero in February for the first time on the back of falling prices for recreational goods, food and furniture, official data showed Tuesday.“The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) was unchanged in the year to February 2015, that is, a 12-month rate of 0.0 percent, down from 0.3 percent in January,” the Office for National Statistics said in a statement.
On fire: Giroud is having no trouble finding the netOlivier Giroud says he is unaffected by criticism of his displays as his form in front of goal continues.The Frenchman is in arguably his hottest streak since arriving in north London, netting nine goals in his previous nine games for the Gunners, including a match-winning brace at Newcastle on Saturday.His 13 league strikes have come in only 19 outings, five of which have been from the substitutes bench, and have left Arsenal with one foot in next season's Champions League.“Since I have been at Arsenal, this is perhaps my best period. I have to continue like that. I do not want to stop there,” Giroud told RMC Sport .“I scored 16 or 17 goals in the league last year. I would like to do better and especially help the team achieve our targets. This is the most important.“Finish second or third would be fine, although we will be hoping Chelsea slip up. Winning the FA Cup is also an objective. I continue my progress. I feel very well at Arsenal. It is important to continue to progress.”The 28-year-old came under particular scrutiny after Arsenal's home leg of their ill-fated Champions League last-16 tie against Monaco.He missed a host of chances in the 3-1 defeat, which was followed by an all too familiar heroic failure in the principality, as the Gunners crashed out on away goals.Giroud believes his form since that night shows his mental strength to come back from a disappointing display.He continued: “I did an interview a week before the match against Monaco. We had covered everything and the journalist said me: ‘Giroud, this is not the same name as Aguero or Diego Costa’.“I know who I am, I know what I'm saying. People who know me know that I am not pretentious.“Obviously, it's was not at the good moment because I lacked efficiency in that game. I did a little teasing. But it's good to have shown mental strength to come back even stronger and prove that critics do not reach me.“I created a shell, whether in good or bad times. I know when I'm good or not. I do not need people for that.”
The parents of five-year-old Ashya King, who were jailed when they took him abroad for brain cancer treatment, have declared their son has made a “miracle” recovery.They said his life was saved because he was given innovative treatment not available to him on the NHS.The Proton Therapy Centre (PTC) in Prague, where he received the treatment last year, said it was “thrilled” to hear news that a recent scan showed no sign of a tumour.Ashya’s mother Naghmeh, who alongside her husband Brett sparked an international manhunt last summer by removing the boy from hospital in Southampton without medical consent, told The Sun the news was “incredible”.“If we had left Ashya with the NHS in Britain, he would not be with us today. He was too weak and would not have survived,” she said.Ashya was finally allowed to undergo treatment at the PTC for brain cancer after a long legal battle fought by his parents and he has since been recovering in Spain.Jana Kulhankova, marketing director at the centre, said she had not seen the latest scan but has been in regular contract with Ashya’s doctor, Hernan Cortes-Funes, since his treatment ended.“Ashya’s doctor told me last week that Ashya is doing so well that he is able to release him for rehabilitation,” said Kulhankova.“If the scans are showing that Ashya is cancer-free, as Mr King says, than we are thrilled, that is what we have worked for.“We have no reason to doubt Mr King — he does all that is best for his child.”Ashya’s father Brett said his son’s condition now justifies their actions in taking him from Southampton General Hospital last August to Spain, where they have a holiday home.He said: “We have saved his life,” adding that they would do the same thing again if they felt they had to.The Kings were arrested in Spain after fleeing the UK and spent several nights in prison away from their son, before being released.A High Court judge approved the move to take Ashya to Prague for proton therapy, which the PTC said is more effective than the radiotherapy Ashya was being offered on the NHS.It limits the collateral damage of radiation to other vital organs, such as the heart and liver in Ashya’s case. This would lead to less severe long-term side-effects including heart and breathing problems.The therapy was not available for him on the NHS, although the health service later agreed to fund Ashya’s treatment.The family, who have previously spoken of their apprehension over returning to the UK for fear social services would get involved, are staying in Marbella where Ashya will continue his recovery.
Cancer-gene testing gives women much more control over their future health. But it also presents them with difficult decisions.Angelina Jolie has the BRCA1 gene, which gave her a 50% chance of developing ovarian cancer at some stage.The average risk for a woman is just 1.4%, so BRCA significantly raises the risk.But Jolie says that wasn't the only reason she opted to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed.Three women in her family have died from cancer, including her mother.And having already had a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer - again because of a high genetic risk - the options would have been broadly familiar.She would have again considered the alternatives, including drug treatment and regular check-ups to reduce the chances.But there is currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer.There is a blood test for a tumour marker called CA125. But it is only raised in 85% of women with ovarian cancer and only 50% of those with early stages of the disease.The symptoms - bloating, pain in the pelvis or lower stomach and difficulty eating - are also vague and can easily be attributed to other causes.So many of the 7,100 women diagnosed each year are picked up at a late stage.That's reflected in the relatively low survival rate at one year - just 72%.So, on paper there would seem to be a lot in favour of preventative surgery.But against that women need to prepare themselves for a sudden menopause.Jolie says she has had a hormonal implant to help with the symptoms, and it's clear she is mentally prepared for a new stage in her life.By going public with her decision she will undoubtedly help many other women in the same situation.When she had her breasts removed, there was a big jump in women in the UK doing the same; doctors called it the "Angelina Jolie effect".And it would seem likely that Jolie's decision will again lead to an increase in healthy women opting to have preventative surgery.
Is David Cameron's candid admission that he won't seek a third term in Downing Street his greatest mistake of the election campaign? Come off it. This isn't even his greatest mistake in March.Remember Lord Bates, the Conservative minister who said that the children of immigrants - kids born in Britain - should be counted in the immigration statistics? He argued that these children showed why tighter controls needed to be placed on migration.The problem with Lord Bates' logic is: where does it end? Are the grandchildren of migrants not proper Brits either? What about their great-grandchildren. It all comes back to the Conservatives' biggest electoral problem: that ethnic minorities, even those which are personally affluent, distrust the party and are unlikely to vote for them. It cost the party a majority in 2010 and could do even more damage in the years to come. And it contributes to the toxicity of the Tory brand; the party is now so hated that none of the SNP, Greens or Plaid Cymru will even contemplate an alliance with them in the House of Commons.Lord Bates gave Cameron an opportunity - he could have sacked a junior minister and sent a message that he was a genuinely different kind of Conservative. Instead, he went silent.Elections are won and lost as much on what doesn't happen as what does. But news, by definition, is set by what happens. So "David Cameron does nothing to improve the Tory brand among city-dwellers, ethnic minorities and Scots" isn't a headline  but  "David Cameron triggers a few days of arid speculation about the  Conservative leadership"  is. Regardless, it is the former, rather than the latter, that is really hurting the Conservative party.
A former Attorney General of Bayelsa state, Chief Anthony George – Ikoli SAN has filed a suit before a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja challenging the eligibility of the Chairman of Silver Group, Ben Bruce in contesting the Bayelsa East Senatorial District election.Chief George -Okoli is asking the court to disqualify Ben Bruce from contesting the election on the ground of his dual citizenship.Bayelsa East Senatorial district comprises of three local governments namely Brass, Nembe, and Ogbia Local governments. Four people contested for the senatorial slot; they are Bruce, George-Ikoli, Madam Irene Digitemi and Mr Nelson Belief. The leadership of the PDP at the state had allegedly prevailed upon other candidates to step down for Bruce on account of his closeness to President Goodluck Jonathan.The originating summons filed before the court by Chief George-Ikoli seeks the court to determine the following issues:Whether having regard to the combined provisions of Sections 66(1)(a) and 28(1) of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), an aspirant for the elective office of the Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who whilst voluntarily acquiring the citizenship of another country (that is the United States of America) and in the process of which he (the aspirant) declares on oath, the absolute and entire renunciation of citizenship of and allegiance and fidelity to Nigeria can without more be eligible and seek election to the office of Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria;Whether an aspirant to the elective office of the Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, who has declared under oath, that “he will support and defend the constitution of the United States of America, and he absolutely and entirely renounces and abjures all allegiance and fidelity to every prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, (including the Federal Republic of Nigeria) of whom or which he was heretofore a subject or citizen” is eligible by the clear provisions of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 (as amended);Whether a citizen of the United States of America whose citizenship is voluntarily acquired by subscription to the “Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America” and which oath absolutely and entirely abjures allegiance to a foreign prince, potentate, state or sovereignty, of whom or which he was heretofore a subject or citizen is eligible by the plurality of the provisions of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended) to contest for the elective office of Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria;Whether the third defendant is not wrong to accept the nomination of the first defendant by the second defendant as its nominee for election to the office of Senator representing Bayelsa East Senatorial District at the forth coming 2015 National Assembly elections in view of the renunciation of the citizenship of Nigeria by the first defendant’s subscription to the absolute, unconditional and entire oath of allegiance of the United States of America;Whether the first defendant having voluntarily subscribed to the absolute oath of allegiance to the United States of America and acquired its citizenship is not hereby ineligible to contest for the office of Senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria; and Whether the second defendant is not wrong to present the first defendant as its candidate for the election to the office of Senator representing Bayelsa East Senatorial DistrictIn a 15 paragraph affidavit deposed to by Chief George-Ikoli, he alleged that after the primary elections at which he came second, he undertook an independent investigations of the entire process leading to the primaries and discovered that the first defendant had disclosed in the affidavit he deposed to in INEC form C.F 001 that he had voluntarily acquired the citizenship of the United States of America and owes allegiance to that country.He stated further: “I was shell shocked to know that the third defendant cleared the first defendant to run for Bayelsa East Senatorial District election when it is apparent on the face of the affidavit that he had voluntarily acquired the citizenship of a country other than Nigeria”.He therefore asked the court to declare that the candidature of the first defendant suffers legal disability, and therefore an order disqualifying him from contesting forth coming Bayelsa East Senatorial District elections.
UNITED Democratic Movement (UDM) leader Bantu Holomisa has taken exception to National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete’s allegation that he is negative about the establishment of an ad hoc committee on Nkandla and will withdraw his party from any participation.Mr Holomisa made it clear in a letter he sent to Ms Mbete on Monday that since she had not responded to or acknowledged his previous letter on the matter, but decided to launch a scathing attack on him, that the UDM would excuse itself from what he termed a flawed process.Last year President Jacob Zuma instructed Police Minister Nathi Nhleko and the National Treasury to determine what costs, if any, he owed for the nonsecurity upgrades to his private Nkandla residence.This was after Public Protector Thuli Madonsela found that Mr Zuma and his family had unduly benefited from the R246m security upgrades to Nkandla.Two other investigations, one by the Special Investigation Unit and the other by an inter-ministerial task team, completely absolved Mr Zuma of any wrongdoing.Rather, those reports pointed fingers at mid-level Department of Public Works officials and Mr Zuma’s architect Minenhle Makhanya.Parliament set up an ad hoc committee just before the May 7 national elections last year to examine the public protector’s report. The committee met for two days as the ruling African National Congress MPs used their voting muscle to shut it down before it got into the crux of the issue.Last week Ms Mbete met with political party representatives to discuss the report that Mr Nhleko was about to table in Parliament.Those discussions resolved to establish another ad hoc committee to re-examine the issue.In his letter to Ms Mbete on Monday, Mr Holomisa states that this process is flawed.He says that the National Assembly had already resolved, based on the previous ad hoc committee’s recommendation, that Cabinet must determine what were or were not security upgrades."The House resolution, does not refer this matter to any other forum or committee other than Cabinet. This clearly means what you wanted party leaders to do, has been directed to the Cabinet by the National Assembly you are presiding over. It is always important that we stick to House resolutions and not usurp powers not given to us," Mr Holomisa’s letter states.Democratic Alliance (DA) Chief Whip John Steenhuisen said his party would prefer to have Mr Nhleko’s report interrogated before an ad hoc committee."Otherwise how does Parliament interrogate a report. This report is Cabinet’s report."We need to examine what is owed by Mr Zuma and, more importantly, the methodology used to get to whatever number Mr Nhleko is recommending."The DA has said it believed Mr Zuma owed about R52.9m on the upgrades to Nkandla. Mr Steenhuisen said his party would not participate in any closed-door meeting or attempt to censor the report.Media reports this weekend stated that Ms Mbete wanted the report to be censored to leave out sensitive security measures.However, Mr Holomisa, when interviewed on SABC radio on Monday morning said that the security upgrades could just be left out and then the issue of what were not upgrades could be dealt with.Inkatha Freedom Party MP Liezl van der Merwe said her party would discuss how to deal with the issue at its national executive committee meeting last night.African Christian Democratic Party MP Steven Swart said his party had not formulated a view yet on the Nkandla committee issue.
JUSTICE Minister Michael Masutha has confirmed that the highly controversial Traditional Courts Bill will return to Parliament this year after having been substantially revised.The earlier version of the bill lapsed in Parliament after ferocious criticism from opposition parties, women’s rights groups and even African National Congress (ANC) ministers including then justice minister Jeff Radebe and then women’s minister Lulu Xingwana.The bill was said to be unconstitutional for creating a second, parallel justice system and for offending the rights of women, particularly in rural areas. It was said that President Jacob Zuma had offered traditional leaders the bill in return for electoral support.Mr Masutha promised there would be wide consultation with all "stakeholders".In a written reply to a parliamentary question late last week, posed by ANC MP Mathole Motshekga, about when the bill would return to Parliament, Mr Masutha said: "I intend to introduce a revised Traditional Courts Bill into Parliament towards the end of the 2015 session … around November or as soon as possible thereafter."The bill will be preceded by a dialogue with all stakeholders and the broad public. The outcomes of this dialogue will inform the contents of the revised bill. The dialogue and the contents of the bill will be communicated with women’s groups, rural communities, traditional leaders, academics, the legal profession and representatives of civil society, in particular, in addition to being made available for general public consultation."Democratic Alliance MP James Selfe, a member of Parliament’s justice committee, said he believed that in its original form the bill was unconstitutional and "if it returns in anything like that (state) it will still be unconstitutional and we will oppose it with the utmost vigour."However, it is possible to recognise and give a role to traditional courts so long as they conform to the constitution."In mid-2012, Ms Xingwana said the original bill was discriminatory and oppressive towards women and should scrapped. "We fought to ensure that we have a right to speak and express our concerns."This bill will really be taking us 20 years back to a time when women … did not have any say in the running of their country and were silenced…. We all know there are cultural practices which are harmful to women and people with disabilities. For example … ukuthwala … where women and children are forced into marriages."
Johannesburg - Three men were sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment each for murder and kidnapping by the Bafokeng Magistrate's Court, North West police said on Tuesday.Tshepo Bethel Maputo, 26, Jacob Obakeng Lesele, 27, and Lawrence Olebogeng Dlamini, 28 were sentenced on Thursday for the crimes committed in 2013, Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said.“The accused were involved in a fight with a 21-year-old victim at a liquor outlet in Phokeng.”They accused the victim of trying to steal a sound system from their car.“The victim was put inside the boot of a car and taken to Kanana dam where he was assaulted. He was left dead on the banks of the dam.”The court declared the men unfit to possess a firearm.
Most debts, such as clothing accounts, cellphones and credit card debt, prescribe after three years - if there has been no payment or acknowledgement of it and no summons in respect of it - and the consumer is then not obliged to pay the debt.
Gunmen in eastern Afghanistan killed at least 13 people in a midnight attack on a highway as at least nine militants died in a suspected US drone strike near Pakistan, authorities said.The highway attack happened in Wardak province's Sayad Abad district, where Taliban fighters hold much territory and launch frequent attacks on security forces. However, no group immediately claimed responsibility for the assault, which comes after several recent attacks targeting buses in the country.The gunmen opened fire on three separate vehicles in the attack, including a bus travelling from Kabul and heading to Ghazni province, said Attahullah Khogyani, a spokesman for the provincial governor. He gave the death toll and said the gunfire wounded at least two civilians.Last month, gunmen in southern Afghanistan kidnapped 30 members of the Hazara ethnic community travelling on a highway in Zabul province. Security forces have been trying to secure their release ever since the attack, the latest to target Shiites in the predominantly Sunni country.Meanwhile, two intelligence officials in Pakistan said the suspected US drone strike in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province killed at least nine militants from the Pakistani terror group Lashkar-e-Islam. The group recently announced it would join forces with the Pakistani Taliban to fight government forces in that country.It was not immediately possible to corroborate the officials' claims about the strike in the rural, mountainous region. Drone strikes have killed civilians in the region in the past.Ahmad Zia Abdulazai, a spokesman for the provincial governor in Nangarhar, said he was only aware of an air strike yesterday afternoon which killed two suspected insurgents.US officials rarely discuss their drone strikes in Afghanistan and Pakistan as many are run by the CIA. Afghan forces have taken the lead in securing their country after US and Nato troops formally ended their combat missions in the country at the start of this year.
Paul Murphy has said “we’re going to fight on this issue and protest in massive numbers when the Government refuse to listen”. Photograph: AFP/Getty ImagesMinister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin has said the Government will introduce a mechanism to ensure people who comply with water charges are not disadvantaged because others refuse to pay.Speaking on his way into Government, he said people could not be allowed to refuse to pay if they were in a position to do so.“There can’t be a position where any of us decide not to pay our bills,” he said.“If you come to a supermarket check out and say, ‘No, not paying the bill’ and walk off, that’s not the way the system works.”The Government had made remarkable efforts to modify the charges system for people who were at the “end of their tether,” he said.“In principle we have to have a mechanism to ensure that people who are compliant, the vast majority of people who pay their way in this country, are not in anyway disadvantaged over people who’ve come to the conclusion there are things they don’t have to pay for.”Irish Water will be able to deduct water bills directly from wages and welfare payments under strengthened compliance measures being considered by the Government.The introduction of attachment orders to increase compliance with water charges marks a step change in the Coalition’s approach to those who do not pay their water bills.While sources said the proposals have yet to be finalised, attachment orders on wages and welfare payments are seen as likely to be included in new measures to be published by Minister for the Environment Alan Kelly.Irish Water would have to have to get a court order to deduct unpaid bills at source.Taoiseach Enda Kenny said on Tuesday morning Minister Kelly would bring his proposals to Cabinet shortly.He said he would prefer not to comment until he saw the proposals.Socialist TD Paul Murphy said the protest on Saturday showed the Government’s “carrot and sticks” strategy does not work.“We now have a big stick being wheeled out in an attempt to intimidate people into paying. I think people will react against that kind of bullying behaviour,” he said.“We don’t know how Minister Kelly or anyone else is going to draw distinction between those that can’t pay and won’t pay.”Mr Murphy said the water charge was not about investment but privatisation.“Here you have people being hammered after six years of austerity, people can’t take anymore and they are correct to say we’re going to fight on this issue and protest in massive numbers when the Government refused to listen...mass non-payment.”Mr Murphy told RTÉ radio an alternative way to raise money for the country’s water needs would be financial transaction tax, which he claimed would raise €500 million.
THE first group of Project Gambia’s 2015 trip have a jam packed day ahead of them.After landing in The Gambia following a safe flight yesterday afternoon and a night’s rest in their hotel, the group will spend the morning visiting Kanifing School where they will present awards to the worthy students.After that the staff and students of Ridgewood High School on the trip will head to Kotusilo village, a poor area of the Gambia which is located next to a rubbish dump.The group will see firsthand what it is like living in abject poverty as the village has very basic conditions – no running water or electricity.After lunch back at their hotel, they will then take a trip to the Kotusilo clinic for the first time to take a donation of medical supplies as well as paint one of the outside walls.The supplies which will be handed over by the project were generously donated by Stourbridge primary schools.You can read our story about the primary schools' medical supplies donation here.Each day the groups are out in The Gambia, a student will write their own blog post detailing their own thoughts and experiences.Blog posts and daily information on the trip will be available on both the Stourbridge News website and at projectgambia.org.uk.The Stourbridge News has also joined forces with Project Gambia to help raise money to buy and install a water pump at the farm in the Gambian village of Sintet.Our Well of Life appeal needs to raise £10,000 to fund the pump and irrigation system to serve drought-stricken farming land.Members of Project Gambia will be visiting Sintet this week where they will see the location of the impending installation of the much needed pump.To make a donation now visit www.justgiving.com/welloflifeappeal/ or text PROG15 and your amount, either £10, £5, £4, £3, £2, £1, to 70070.People can also donate cash or cheques in person at the Stourbridge News offices, at St John’s House, St John’s Road, Stourbridge.Cheques need to be made payable to Project Gambia Trust Ridgewood, and you’ll need to write Well off Life Appeal on the back.If you are carrying out an event to help raise funds for the Well of Life Appeal please call our reporter Dan Sharp on 01384 358223, or email dan.sharp@stourbridgenews.co.uk with details.
Cristiano Ronaldo is not shy about telling off his team mates. Ask Gareth Bale… or Sami Khedira… or in fact, any Real Madrid reserve with the temerity to be in the vicinity of the great CR7.Now it seems the names of every Real Madrid player have gone into Ronaldo's bad books, following Los Blancos' 2-1 defeat to Barcelona in Sunday night's El Clasico.This new footage (above) shows the Ballon D'Or winner storming off the Nou Camp pitch at full time, offering Karim Benzema his frank assessment of where Real Madrid went wrong in Spain's biggest game.According to Spanish TV, he can be seen saying:The exact translation into English is a little unpleasant. But in the most basic terms, Ronaldo was saying:Just in case that verdict on his side's lack of courage and bottle wasn't clear enough, the Portuguese superstar was kind enough to add in a rather graphic hand gesture, which seemed to imitate the appearance of one rather unpleasant part of the body - the part of the body that Cristiano thought his side were missing.We'll let you take a look. It's delightful.
A man has died and another is in serious condition in hospital after they were hit by a car while they were recovering a broken down vehicle.They were in the process of recovering the vehicle in Scotland Street, Glasgow, when the collision happened at around 6.20pm yesterday.The two men, aged 62 and 48, were taken to the city's Southern General Hospital.The 62-year-old died and the 48 year old man is in a serious but stable condition.The driver of the BMW was not injured but was left badly shaken by the incident.Police appealed for information about the collision which happened on the the westbound carriageway of Scotland Street, near to Shields Road and involved a Mercedes recovery vehicle.The road was closed for several hours for crash scene investigations.It is not yet known whether the man who died was a recovery worker or the driver of the broken down vehicle.
The actresses – who both star in the HBO series – put on a glamorous display on the event's red carpet. Emilia wowed in a slinky black floor-length gown which hugged her curves in all the right places.  With its dramatic sleeve detail the sophisticated gown ensured the 28-year-old stood out from the crowd.The star – who plays Daenerys Targaryen in Game of Thrones – added a pop of colour with a bright red lip and slicked her dark tresses into a stylish low bun. Meanwhile, Gwendoline looked incredible in a stylish green floor-length gown, which the 36-year-old paired with some stylish flat yellow shoes.  Belted around the waist, the dress emphasised the actress' slim figure.The star added a chic monochrome blazer to finish her look.  Gwendoline – who plays Brienne of Tarth in the drama – wore her short blonde locks in a stylish quiff and added a slick of pink lipstick.  Speaking at the London season 5 premiere last week, Gwendoline said: "In season five we're going to see certain characters come to the forefront and explode in your face." On her fabulous character, she added: "She doesn't have an ego. She's all honour if you cut through her, like an honour cheese. A delicious cheese!"
Macmillan Cancer Support said Britain was struggling to even match the survival rates many other nations had in the 1990s. The figures, which cover the period from 2005 and 2009 compared to the 10 years previous, looked at breast, lung, colon and stomach cancers. Examples of Britain's poor performance include a 19 per cent survival rate of stomach cancer in the UK in the four years after 2005, compared to 31 per cent in Italy a decade before, as well as 30 per cent in Austria and 23 per cent in Germany. For colon cancer, 54 per cent of people survived in the UK in the recent figures, lagging behind Finland (59 per cent), Italy (58 per cent) and France (57 per cent) in the earlier results. Macmillan's chief executive Lynda Thomas called for all political parties to commit to tackling the shameful rates. She said: "This analysis exposes the harsh reality that because UK cancer survival rates are lagging so far behind the rest of Europe, people are dying needlessly. "What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable. If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can and should bridge the gap."With the general election in our sights, Macmillan is urging all political parties to make cancer a top health priority and commit to improving UK cancer survival rates and outcomes in order to match the best in Europe." It was previously thought one in three people would develop cancer at some point in their lives. But studies underestimated the risk of a disease which kills 160,000 in the UK every year and it is now believed half of people would contract it. The alarming “milestone” applies to those born in the early 1960s and beyond. It means a child born today has a 50 per cent chance of developing cancer at some point in their lifetime. Based on the current population, 32million will be diagnosed with 16million dying from the condition. Experts warned an ageing population and failure to address chronically unhealthy lifestyles means the NHS could be placed under unprecedented pressure. Some of Britain’s leading cancer specialists agree the alarming prophecy highlights an “urgent” need to bolster services. Men born 55 years ago have a 53.5 per cent risk of being diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime. For women it is 47.5 per cent. For those born in 1960 the risk of getting cancer is 34 per cent more than those born in 1930. While age remains the biggest risk of developing some form of the disease, lifestyle choices like poor diet, obesity, sunburn and lack of exercise are blamed for soaring rates.Dr Ian Campbell, a family GP in Nottingham, said: “It’s distressing that we are failing to offer the best cancer care possible.  “The NHS doesn’t have limitless resources, we can’t do everything we would like, but clearly life-threatening disease like cancer deserves nothing short of the best possible care. “I am also concerned the pressure we in General Practice have had. To delay referring patients for specialist investigations will inevitably mean some cancer diagnoses are at best delayed and at worst missed altogether.  “We have to agree to fund the NHS adequately to ensure we remain the best health care system in the world.” Lung, pancreatic and oesophageal cancer survival rates remain poor, while those diagnosed with testicular cancer now have a 90% chance of beating the disease. Cheap package holidays and Britain’s obsession with fake tans are blamed for an increase in melanomas, while head and neck cancers are “emerging” types of the disease.  Growing older is the biggest risk factor for most cancers but four in 10 cancers diagnosed each year in the UK could be prevented by changes in lifestyle. In 2012/13 NHS England had a budget of £105billion of which £5.68bn was spent on cancer services - roughly one in £18.Sarah Woolnough, of Cancer Research UK, said: “These figures show the UK still lags behind many other countries even though our cancer survival is improving.  “It’s vital the Government prioritises cancer and invests more into cancer services so our survival rates can match the best in the world.” Medical experts say the situation in the UK has improved in the years after the study covers. However, they admit more could be done. The Department of Health said: “As this research shows, when this Government came to office cancer survival rates were the worst in Western Europe – but we’ve invested an extra £750million and those rates are now at an all-time high.” NHS England's national clinical director for cancer Sean Duffy said: ""We have come on leaps and bounds since this 2009 data highlighted by Macmillan, but we have an ambition to save even more lives and it's time to take a fresh look at how we can do better. "This is why we have already established an independent taskforce to develop a new cancer strategy for the next five years."
Greece and the European Union could reach a deal as early as this week to allow the release of badly needed aid funds for Athens, European Parliament President Martin Schulz said Tuesday."In my opinion, by the end of the week we will reach a new understanding that will be enough to unblock the most urgent funds," Schulz said in an interview published in Italy's La Repubblica newspaper.Greece is desperately seeking the last tranche of a 240-billion-euro ($255-billion) EU-IMF bailout, amounting to about seven billion euros, but Brussels is refusing until it first aepproves Athens's new package of reforms to its crisis-ridden economy.A Greek government spokesman said Athens would submit a new list of reforms "by Monday at the latest" to its creditors.New Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras says the budget cuts and structural reforms demanded over the last five years in exchange for two massive bailout programmes have not helped, but instead brought his country to its knees.However, creditor institutions say Greece needs to pursue stringent fiscal reforms to put its financial house in order after years of mismanagement led to crisis and fears that the country will have to exit the euro single currency.
Stereophonics continued their return to live performance with a star-studded gig at London's Royal Albert Hall last night.The Cwmaman band were joined on stage by Sir Tom Jones - who helped them relive their 2000 duet Mama Told Me Not To Come - and Rolling Stone Ronnie Wood to help raise money for Teenage Cancer Trust.The Valleys' rockers also treated fans to two new songs from their upcoming, as-yet-untitled ninth album - C'est La Vie and Song For The Summer.The 'Phonics kicked off with Catacomb from their Graffiti On The Train LP and closed with their career-rejuvenating 2005 single Dakota, rounding out a hits heavy set that ensured the crowd left happy.Here's what social media made of the group's triumphant night in the Big Smoke.
Last week the Bank of England's chief economist Andy Haldane told us that the next move in the official interest rate was at least as likely to be down as up - because of the growing risk that inflation would remain well below the 2% target for longer.So what do inflation figures for February tell us about whether the greater danger is prices that are falling, deflation, or prices that are set to rise too fast?Well with the official inflation figure announced as a big fat zero - the lowest since records were first properly kept - interest rates look set to be lower for longer, and the official Bank of England rate of 0.5% could even be nudged nearer nought.So why has inflation vanished?Well the Office for National Statistics says that the biggest contributors to the drop in inflation from a trivial 0.3% to 0% were food and non-alcoholic drinks, furniture and household goods, recreation and culture (books, games, toys, hobbies and "data processing equipment").What is striking is that transport - the price of petrol and diesel - was not a factor this month in the drop in the inflation rate, because oil prices have risen a bit.So the driver of falling inflation looks to be the strength of sterling, especially against the weakening euro - which is reducing the cost of imports.The important point is that, for now at least, the fall in the price of food, games, petrol and energy, if it persists for a few months, is good news for most of us - because it increases our spending power and our pounds go further. In other words we feel and are a bit richer.But if stagnation in prices were to go on for longer, if it were to turn into fully fledged deflation, that would be worrying.The point is that if we thought that the price of things we don't normally have to buy at any particular moment - household goods like washing machines for example, or motor cars - was on a firmly downward path, we would probably defer purchases of those things, and that would depress economic activity.We would be experiencing Japanese-style bad deflation, of the sort that can undermine prosperity for years and even (in Japan's case) decades.Right now, we are some considerable way from bad deflation - although across the Channel the European Central Bank is increasingly anxious that pernicious deflation is the looming monster in its midst.As for the Bank of England's Mr Haldane, his concern, which he said was a personal view, is that the relationship between growing employment and wage rises has weakened - such that the strength of the UK's economic recovery and the fall in unemployment might not be leading to sufficiently rapid wage growth that would force inflation back to target.So in other words the big test of whether this is good or worrying deflation will come in the next few weeks, when a disproportionate number of employers decide what they are going to pay their people over the coming year.Or to put it another way, any signs that a slight weakening in wage growth, seen in the last official figures, is becoming a trend would mean there is slim chance of an interest rate rise till the autumn of 2016 or later - and there could even be more quantitative easing (creation of money) and an interest rate cut.
In August and September 2013 the Shetland Public Partnership Forum (PPF) carried out a survey among patients of the Lerwick Health Centre to establish the cause of much concern over the service being provided.An amazing 908 people responded to the survey and the message was clear, 78 per cent were unhappy with the appointment system and 73 per cent were unhappy with the walk-in clinic.The PPF raised four cases for change: the appointment of a dedicated practice manager; better team working; improvements in the amenities; and surgeries outside of normal office hours.There have been improvements to amenities within the centre which are ongoing and two issues are outstanding: practice manager and the out-of-hours service, both of which are still being pursued.The better team working case has resulted in two main initiatives, firstly as from last autumn health care assistants have been reorganised to provide more responsive assistance to the general practitioners (GPs). Specifically this has meant that when blood samples have to be taken the patient can have this done straight away rather than having to make a separate appointment.The second change resulting from this case comes into effect from Monday. As from this date all patients with an acute (short-term) illness will be given an appointment with an advanced nurse practitioner (ANP).Also from this date there will no longer be any walk-in clinics at the Lerwick Health Centre. Anyone phoning the surgery and needing to be seen on that day will be given an appointment with an advanced nurse practitioner.There are four new ANPs joining Joan Sandison who has been providing an advanced nursing service for many years. Together they will be able to see up to 100 patients each day which should cope with the number of patients needing seen without them having to wait for hours.The Public Partnership Forum has worked with the GPs, staff and management at both the Lerwick Health Centre and more widely across NHS Shetland to bring about this change.This is a major change to the way healthcare is delivered in Lerwick and we urge patients to give the new service their support. Inevitably it will take a little time for the new appointment system and the ANPs to settle in, please be patient.The GPs have not gone away. There will always be at least one doctor in the health centre whenever there are ANPs taking clinics. The ANPs work under very strict guidelines and should the initial assessment of a patient indicate that a doctor needs to be consulted there will be one immediately available to do so.If a doctor is called in to see a patient with an ANP the doctor can give guidance to the ANP or even take over the consultation. General practitioners will continue to be available for any patient who needs a home visit and for treating patients who have complex or chronic health needs.The Public Partnership Forum wishes all the staff at the Lerwick Health Centre much success as they undertake this new way of working and we welcome the new advanced nurse practitioners.
A conman car dealer who offered to sell people's luxury cars but did not pay them has been jailed for fraud.Nick Morley defrauded up to 35 people while running NM Jags and was called "thoroughly dishonest" and a "practised fraudster".Most of the victims duped into the sale-or-return scam were Jaguar owners, Bristol Crown Court heard.He was jailed for five years and eight months and banned from holding the directorship of a company for 10 years.Dave Trotter, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: "People would advertise their cars in various publications, such as Autotrader, which are these days done online."There'd be a member of staff within the business who would then contact the seller saying 'we can sell your car for you and get you a better return' and 'we can take the hassle away from you'."And all they end up getting is double hassle because regularly there'd be no payment or a battle to get any payment."He said: "I made a mistake in trusting him. I was taken in by a good website. I talked to his employees and they all seemed to know what they were talking about."One of Morley's employees, Michael Horton, was also convicted for his part in the fraud and is awaiting sentence.Morley, from Bristol, ran NM Jags dealerships across Bristol at Temple Cloud, Hartcliffe Way, Whitchurch and in Weston-Super-Mare and had a turnover of between £5-6m.
Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canDressed in red, had crazy hair and some dressed up!Clerkhill, Buchanhaven and Dales Park schools join in the funThe charity held its big fundraising day on Friday, March 13 and the pupils were more than happy to do their bit.Buchanhaven School held a dress red day, a raffle to win a football shirt and sold red noses to raise some cash.They also arranged a Soak the Teacher event in which the teacher with the most money raised in their name was soaked in ice bucket challenge style.All of the teachers involved were nervous throughout the day but Mr Loney, the school’s deputy head teacher, was the unlucky winner.Pupils had great fun as they watched Mr Loney being soaked at the end of the school day, but he was a good sport and even wore flippers and a snorkel for the occasion!Over at Dales Park, pupils hosted a fun afternoon filled with various stalls and games to raise money.Some pupils also dressed funny for the day and the school raised £245.95.Meanwhile Clerkhill School held a Pie the Teacher event in which head teacher Mr Cordiner and three other teachers were the unlucky participants.At the end of the event, it was revealed that the school raised £1,065.27.See our website for a video from the Pie the Teacher event.
Manchester based editing and recording specialist, Editors Keys, have achieved their goal of creating the world’s first backlit shortcut keyboard.Having completed a successful Kickstarter campaign last year the product will assist editors all over the world.The goal of securing £10,000 funding towards the production of the keyboard was met within just 48 hours after the launch and in 72 hours 200 per cent funding was achieved.Company director Mark Brown said: “We couldn’t be more excited about how the campaign has gone. It’s been fantastic to have the benefit of direct feedback from our customers, which also helped us to develop a better product before we launched it.”Since the completion of the Kickstarter campaign, the interest for the keyboard has continued to grow and talks have now begun with some of the major production studios of Hollywood to start using specially designed versions of the keyboards across their suites.The campaign has been a great stepping stone for the small business based in Manchester’s Barton Arcade with support from the likes of Coldplay producer Rik Simpson and Optical Express. Bosses said it has meant a lot in terms of expansion and exposure.
The owner of a Chinese restaurant in Nairobi that operated a ‘No Africans’ policy has been arrested after media reports about the establishment triggered an outcry on social media.Zhao Yang was charged with operating a restaurant without a valid licence only hours after the Daily Nation, Kenya’s biggest newspaper, published a front-page story about the restaurant.Co-owner Esther Zhao told the newspaper that Africans posed a security risk and needed to be kept out after 5pm. “We don’t admit Africans that we don’t know because you never know who is Al-Shabaab and who isn’t,” she said, referring to the Somali-based terror group blamed for a number of attacks in Kenya in recent years.“It is not like it is written on somebody’s face that they are a thug armed with a gun.”Staff were quoted saying the restaurant’s security detail were under strict instruction not to let in any Africans in the evening, although one or two “loyal customers” were allowed.The story triggered outrage across the internet. Under the hashtag #noblacksallowed, Twitter users called for the restaurant to be shut down.“I don’t understand how this article isn’t ironic. This can’t be real,” one reader, Aisha, said. Most commentators demanded the deportation of the restaurant owners.“There is a proverb, loosely translated, which says ‘if you hate the cow, you should also shun leather’,” one said. “Let the Chinese go do this in China. This is Kenya, and if there is something they do not like, they are free to leave.”Like most countries on the continent, there has been an extraordinary rise in Chinese economic engagement in Kenya over the past decade. Trade volumes have grown from $186.37m (£125m) in 2002 to $3.27bn (£2.2bn) in 2013 and the growing number of Chinese expatriates has been accompanied by the mushrooming of numerous Chinese-operated restaurants and hotels.Although many Kenyans have welcomed Beijing’s investment in major infrastructure projects including a new $5.2bn railway to replace the track built by the British more than a century ago, some Chinese have been blamed for a rise in poaching in the country’s national parks.Zhao faces a prison term of 18 months or a fine of just over $1,000 if found guilty of operating the restaurant without a licence. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights called on any Kenyans who had been barred from the restaurant to get in touch because it planned to lodge a civil suit.
Protesters are concerned about the sudden appearance of the flag and cherrypickerCampaigners have slated T In The Park organisers after a Scotland flag was raised next to an osprey’s nest near the Strathallan Estate in what they claim appeared to be a desperate effort to try and scare off the birds.Ospreys are due to return to the nest near the proposed festival site any day now and if they do an exclusion zone would have to be set up around it, scuppering DF Concerts’ chances of getting planning approval for hosting the festival on the estate this summer.DF Concerts have previously suggested accusations they were deliberately trying to scare the protected birds of  prey off the estate were “absurd”.But a photograph taken at the site yesterday showed a Scotland flag, balloons and a string of CDs all sailing in the air close to the nest.A spokesperson for the Strathallan T Action Group claimed the photograph proved DF Concerts were “up to no good”.She told the PA: “There is a cherry picker close to the nest which has been raised to its full extent and they have attached a Scottish flag, a couple of balloons and some CDs to catch the light and scare the birds away.“I know it is not illegal to try and prevent birds from coming to the nest but this is shocking.“There is no chance the birds are going to nest with this kind of disturbance going on.”The PA contacted DF Concerts to ask exactly what was happening on the estate but their media team had failed to return our call by the time the paper went to press.

FINANCIAL services company Anchor Group moved quickly on Monday to distance itself from allegations placing asset manager Clarus Capital at the centre of a Ponzi scheme based in Mauritius.In a letter to his shareholders, Anchor Group CEO Peter Armitage said Cobus Kellermann, the alleged mastermind behind the scheme, was the controlling shareholder of Clarus Asset Management."We have managed two equity funds and a property fund on an outsourced basis, which is disclosed on the fact sheets of these funds. I believe Coronation, Efficient, Contego and Atlantic have performed similar outsourced services to ourselves," Mr Armitage said.He said allegations against Mr Kellermann related to offshore activities and there had been no accusations or inferences regarding these local investment funds, which are regulated under the auspices of the Financial Services Board."My name was listed on the Clarus website, which they did when we started managing their funds, for their marketing purposes. Unfortunately I agreed to this. I have never been involved in Clarus, other than Anchor managing some of their funds, and have never met any of the other Clarus individuals other than Cobus," he said.Mr Armitage told Business Day that Anchor Group administered about R300m of Clarus’s unit trusts out of a total of R1.35bn worth of funds that Clarus had under its belt."The funds we manage are 100% okay. There is just no room for impropriety," he said.Mr Armitage said Momentum Asset Managers and Standard Bank were trustees of the funds administered by Clarus.A spokesperson for Momentum Asset Managers said the company would issue a statement on Tuesday.A Standard Bank response to Business Day queries stated it was still determining exactly what the relationship was, if any, with Clarus.Mr Kellermann did not respond to calls and messages. The Clarus website appeared to have been taken down.Mr Kellermann was singled out as the mastermind behind the scheme by internet site offshorealert.com that reported that a number of companies he was involved with were being investigated by the Mauritian and British police concerning irregular dealings and criminal activity.Offshorealert.com reported that the Belvedere Asset Management that is owned by Mr Kellermann and his Irish business partner. David Cosgrove, had about R200bn under its control. Mr Cosgrove did not return any calls.
WHAT was a light-hearted Bafana press conference on Monday turned sour when coach Shakes Mashaba asked if he could "end it on a sad note".The hastily arranged briefing in Milpark had given the gathered hacks a delightful theme — one of harmony in the Bafana camp after prodigal son May Mahlangu had reported for duty despite being injured.Thulani Serero and Kamohelo Mokotjo, two players who have also had run-ins with the coach recently, were expected to arrive on Monday night. But Mashaba saw an opportunity to again speak directly to his critics, whom he said were not in the room."Nobody would have expected me to say this. I am Ephraim Mashaba. Those who still doubt my qualities of coaching the national team are wasting time," he said."People are still questioning whether I am the right person to coach this team or not. Who is the right person? I am a South African by birth. I deserve to be here and my (skin) colour does not stop me from coaching the national team. I want people to know that. And it is one section, I will deal with them in time."Mashaba ended his remarks with a "thank you", but left many with questions unanswered. The coach has been under fire since Bafana’s return from the Africa Cup of Nations in Equatorial Guinea, where they failed to go beyond the group stages following defeats to Algeria and Ghana as well as a draw against Senegal.His tactics, especially the decision to rotate the three goalkeepers in all three matches, were questioned and led to the South African Football Association vowing to intensify its search for a technical director and playing the role of mediator to bring back four overseas-based players he had sidelined in Serero, Mokotjo, Mahlangu and Ayanda Patosi.The technical director post remains vacant, while the press conference has highlighted the successful mediation process — which Mashaba overshadowed with his attacks on his detractors — ahead of the two friendly matches away to Swaziland on Wednesday and Nigeria in Nelspruit on Sunday.Still, the coach will feel he might have finally got through to his players about their loyalty and wearing the national team jersey with pride."We haven’t sat down with May yet because now is not the right time. We appreciate him coming all the way even though he is injured. We will discuss all these issues — Mahlangu was suspended from Bafana for withdrawing because of fatigue in November — when he is playing again," said Mashaba.Another player on the injury list is right back Anele Ngcongca, while Dean Furman’s English club, Doncaster, asked for the midfielder to be excused so he can be available for two must-win games in their bid to gain promotion from League One. Mashaba said he would not be calling up replacements.After resisting the urge to question the Bafana selection policy for some time now, Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane felt he had an open window at the weekend to speak on the criteria.Sundowns are undoubtedly the form team in the Premiership and have also scored 14 goals in four matches in all competitions.A former national team coach himself for two years after the 2010 World Cup, Mosimane reiterated his backing for Bafana, but he is unhappy that Mashaba is ignoring his players.Midfielder Bongani Zungu is the only Sundowns player deemed good enough to warrant a call-up for the coming friendlies."Where are our players in the national team? If Teko (Modise) is not going to win the footballer of the season award then I don’t know," Mosimane said. "It is unbelievable. You look at the Bafana team, we hardly have a player. Even in the Africa Cup of Nations, none of my players (Zungu and Themba Zwane) played. Which team scores goals? Which team is on form? (But) We don’t have players in Bafana."
Sharks and Bulls doing well but ‘my heart’s with the Stormers’Sharks and Bulls doing well but ‘my heart’s with the Stormers’INJURED Springbok captain Jean de Villiers is backing the Stormers to continue to do well in the Super Rugby tournament, but he admits the Sharks and Bulls are also hitting form.The Stormers had a bye last week and have just arrived in New Zealand. They are preparing in Queenstown to take on the Highlanders in Dunedin on Saturday.Last weekend the Sharks and Bulls both won by a point over the Chiefs and Western Force and have both vaulted into the play-off race. The Bulls have bounced back with three consecutive wins after losing their first two games of the campaign and the Sharks won over two consecutive weeks for the first time this season."It’s been a closely contested campaign," De Villiers said. "The Bulls are getting better and the Sharks are back to winning ways, they have one of the strongest squads in the tournament and hopefully they can keep firing."The Stormers have shown the intent and desire that they possess. My heart lies with them and if they can pull it off this season, it will be great."I’ve watched some Super Rugby but I’ve also tried to distance myself so that I can feed the hunger I have to play again."With the Stormers it’s also difficult because you’re part of the squad but also not a part of it. They have been fantastic, and see how they’re playing with the youngsters coming through."De Villiers, who will miss the entire campaign as he recovers from a severe knee injury sustained while playing for the Springboks against Wales last November, is also pleased with the player-resting policy in place."I like this player-resting policy, not only because it’s good for the Springboks but because it’s also good for the Super Rugby competition," De Villiers said."No player can be at his optimum for 16 weeks, it’s tough to keep your standard high. By forcing the guys to rest you can get the best out of them when they play, not idling at 70%-80%."
New York - Petroleo Brasileiro SA had the outlook on its credit rating cut by Standard & Poor’s as the oil producer faces difficulties in financing investments amid Brazil’s largest-ever corruption probe.S&P cut the outlook on Petrobras’s BBB- rating, the lowest investment grade, to negative from stable, according to a statement on Monday. The announcement comes a month after Moody’s Investors Service chopped its rating on the state-run oil producer by two levels to junk grade.Petrobras should have weaker cash flow and higher leverage in 2015 and 2016 as capital markets remain “restricted,” weighing on plans to increase production, S&P said. Petrobras has been shut out of debt markets after it delayed an earnings report because of difficulties deciding on the size of corruption-related writedowns.“The ongoing corruption investigations not only squeezed financing of Petrobras’ investment plan, but also weakened its main contractors’ creditworthiness and slowed the construction of the oil rigs to ramp-up production,” S&P analysts led by Renata Lotfi wrote. “We expect that cash flows could deteriorate further.”While S&P affirmed the oil producer’s credit grade, the ratings company chopped Petrobras’ stand-alone credit profile, which doesn’t take into account government support, to B+, four levels below investment grade. The likelihood the government would provide “timely and sufficient extraordinary support” to the company is considered “very high”, S&P said.The plunge in the real, which has dropped 15 percent this year, is likely to have an additional negative impact, S&P said.The ratings company also affirmed Brazil’s BBB- sovereign rating on Monday, with a stable outlook.
Johannesburg - Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi says President Jacob Zuma’s call for a tripartite alliance special meeting to thrash out differences besieging the coalition can work only if accompanied by concrete action.Vavi and SACP second deputy general secretary Solly Mapaila welcomed Zuma’s call for an indaba of leaders of the alliance on Monday.Vavi said that while he and all those genuinely in search of unity within the alliance would welcome a special meeting, it could prove futile unless there was political will to implement whatever agreements or resolutions were made.“This proposal for a week-long introspection in that context will work if accompanied by concrete action to make it happen,” Vavi told The Star on Monday, when asked for his response to Zuma’s proposal.Zuma made the proposal for an alliance summit on Sunday while addressing hundreds of people at the reburial of SACP stalwart JB Marks in Ventersdorp, North West.The president was quoted as saying that he, as the leader of the main alliance partner, the ANC, would summon the SACP and Cosatu leaders to a meeting.“Our enemies are ready to destroy us, and if we’re not untied, we will be easy prey,” Zuma was quoted as having said.“We can’t as leaders stand and say ‘I don’t care what happens as long as I disagree with so-and-so’; it is the end of the story,” Zuma added.The president’s call for a special meeting could be construed as an admission that the ANC’s task team, which had been appointed to mediate between Cosatu’s warring factions, was failing.Cosatu has been at the epicentre of the ructions within the tripartite alliance, with the labour federation fractured by differences between a faction aligned to Zuma himself and another opposed to his administration’s “capitalist and neo-liberal policies”.Cosatu president S’dumo Dlamini is seen as a strong Zuma ally, while Vavi has openly criticised Zuma’s administration for its alleged ambivalence in implementing Cosatu’s resolutions, notably those taken at the federation’s 11th national congress in 2012.On Monday, Vavi wagged his finger at the ANC, laying the blame for the divisions paralysing the alliance squarely on the governing party.He said: “Cosatu’s 11th national congress, like others before, developed proposals on how to make the alliance work as the engine of transformation.“In the past, (we wrote) three letters, requesting a meeting on these proposals. (These) were not even acknowledged by the ANC,” Vavi said.He added: “But to me, the most urgent challenge remains the unity of workers.“Cosatu is imploding, and that’s a more urgent challenge, even though I acknowledge that these challenges are interconnected.”Mapaila said the SACP was pleased with Zuma’s proposal, although it was not something entirely new as “the alliance secretariat” had been working on convening a meeting.“The meeting is important in that whatever resolutions and programmes you implement on the ground, no (alliance) partner can dispute it,” he added.The SACP, notably its general secretary Blade Nzimande, has often been accused of fomenting divisions with Cosatu.Mapaila scoffed at this suggestion on Monday, saying the SACP has always been committed in the unity of the tripartite alliance and Cosatu.
AGRICULTURAL NEWS - Being able to provide a steady supply of quality and quantity products will help you on the road to success.Finding an outlet to sell your fruit and vegetables is important if you want to switch from growing for yourself (subsistence) to making money from your efforts, but as many growers have found, this is often easier said than done. For one thing, it involves planning.Find a market before planning your crop. In other words, it’s not a case of growing the vegetables, then finding somewhere to sell them. You first need to find out what’s needed (the demand), then you must plan for the required quality and correct quantity, and make sure you can provide a continuous supply for your outlet.This last point is very important. Think how hard it would be if you had to find a new outlet for your produce every month – it’s the same with markets. They need to know you can supply them what they want on a regular basis. So there must be a continuity of quality, quantity and supply.There are many projects to help emerging farmers market their produce, but do some research on your own to know what options you have – especially since these are decisions you have to make before planning your crop. In this way, you’ll get the best out of whatever project you choose.Read the brief overview of the markets available to a fruit and vegetable producer in the 8 April 2011 issue.
An anti-child abuse campaigner has been convicted of waging a cyber-stalking crusade against attack victim Shy Keenan.Mother-of-eight Penny Mellor, aged 53, of Coven Mill Close, Wolverhampton, had denied stalking the anti-paedophile campaigner but was convicted at the end of an eight-day trial.Now she must wait to hear her fate. Sentencing has been adjourned at Chelmsford Crown Court for reports until 16 April. In the mean time, Judge David Turner QC imposed an interim restraining order on Mellor banning her from contacting Ms Keenan or her family.She was also banned from posting or documenting any personal information on the internet or other media outlets, from commenting about Ms Keenan's autobiography Broken or any other article she publishes and from sending any correspondence about Ms Keenan, her book or any article.The judge agreed that Mellor could report any crime in good faith, to respond to inquiries of her by the authorities and to seek her own legal advice about Ms Keenan’s autobiography, Broken, or any Ms Keenan article.Mellor told the judge she was in contact with her MPs about books which contain graphic descriptions of pornography without any censorship or warnings and which were available to children. She had also lodged a complaint about how Essex Police had handled her complaints.Mellor's campaign work has included supporting Sally and Steve Clark and Angela Canning in the late 1990s/early 2000s. The two mothers were jailed for the murders of their cot death babies and later released on appeal after question marks over the expert's evidence.Mellor’s trial has cost over £16,800 and the judge said she must give details of her financial affairs. He commented: "You have put the public to some serious expense all of which was, frankly, avoidable. These things have consequences."After the verdict, Mellor told the judge she wanted to appeal her conviction. He said she would have to prepare her case and ask permission from the Court of Appeal. "I will do that," she replied.During the trial high-profile child rights campaigner, Esther Rantzen gave evidence on behalf of Mellor.Jurors heard how the abuse took place between January 1 and March 16, 2013.Mellor sent Ms Keenan distressing tweets and published statements about her in emails sent to work associates.Ms Keenan revealed to jurors that within hours of her own son dying, Mellor had sent her a text saying she had murdered him.
A  United States (US) drone strike killed at least nine Pakistani militants in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province early on Tuesday.According to official reports, the killed militants were identified as LI Commander, Fazal Amin and Wajid from the Malik Din Khel clan of the Afridi tribe.Others include commander Shamat Khan, Commander Sahar Gul and Shakir from the Sepah tribe.Tuesday’s drone strike was near the site of fierce fighting on the Pakistani side of the border in recent days. Fighter jets have been pounding positions in the Tirah Valley in the Khyber region, and the military said it has killed scores of militants.At least seven soldiers have also been killed.Two Pakistani intelligence officials confirmed Tuesday’s strike in the Nazyan area of Nangarhar near Pakistan’s Khyber Agency.They said the nine militants belonged to the Pakistani Taliban and Lashkar-e-Islam, which announced an alliance with the Taliban earlier this month.No one tracks drone strikes in Afghanistan – many of them take place in remote regions and are not reported – but Taliban commanders said that fighters there were being increasingly targeted since late last year.The strikes came amid warming relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, traditionally hostile neighbors who accuse each other of harboring insurgents to act as proxy forces.Relations improved after Afghan President, Ashraf Ghani was elected last year. Pakistan said that  it is supporting potential peace talks between the Afghan government and Afghan Taliban.Diplomats hoped Pakistan could pressure Afghan Taliban with bases in Pakistan to negotiate.But Pakistan has also said it wants to see action taken against Pakistani insurgents with bases in Afghanistan.

Fake Facebook profiles will be set up by council officers in Staffordshire to try to befriend benefits cheats to catch them out.Fraudsters around the country have already been exposed with 'single mothers' posting pictures of their weddings and 'disabled' claimants walking freely on the Great Wall of China.Now cheats in a Cannock have been warned after council bosses became the latest to sanction the move.Cabinet members at Cannock Chase Council nodded through the changes to the authority's Surveillance Policy which included a new section on how regulatory staff can take advantage of social media to snoop on those they suspected were making fraudulent claims.As well as benefit cheats the practice could also be used to weed out illegal traders and fly-tippers.Council solicitor Alastair Welsh, said: "The increased use of social media means that certain information on individuals can now be found on social media sites and applications such as Facebook."Much of this information is publicly available - anyone can access it through the internet - however, some information can only be obtained by passing through certain privacy controls such as requesting to be an individual's 'friend' on the site."The policy has been amended to inform officers as to when such circumstances may be classed as covert operations and require authorisation."The report goes on to say that where it is 'necessary' and 'proportionate' council officers can use a fake identity and issue a friend request to someone under investigation.Although they can only do that once all less intrusive options have been ruled out and a District Judge or magistrate has signed off on the move.Council leader George Adamson said: "This was part of a general update to the policy. As a council we would obviously use it as little as possible when we think there is some sort of offence."Social media is far more important than it was five years ago and we have had to update our systems appropriately."South Staffordshire Council already has this power as policy but legal chief David Pattison said it had not been used in three years and stressed it was a last resort.In April last year a Northumberland woman was ordered to pay back £35,000 in fraudulent disability benefits after she posted a picture of herself standing on the Great Wall of China despite claiming she could not walk further than the length of a car.A month later a woman in Exeter claiming to be a 'single mother' as part of a ruse to swindle £65,000 in benefits was caught out because her Facebook page said she was married.Another mother in Coventry was outed in November when she posted pictures of her wedding online despite illegally pocketing nearly £60,000 over nine years declaring herself as a 'single mother-of-three'.
In an interview on the Money Show with Bruce DJ Sbu whose real name is Sibusiso Leope clarified that he had nothing to do with creating the cover.Sbu claims he just retweeted it after becoming aware of it on social media.“You need to remember the struggles of small businesses in this country, I did not fabricate any cover, I see images of myself on social media all the time. I am extremely disappointed in Forbes’ Chris Bishop for issuing that statement. I am extremely hungry; I don’t conform to the rules. I saw the image, it’s brilliant, and I retweeted it."DJ Sbu's #mofaya is indeed profiled on Forbes.com, honouring the energy beverage companies that are from Africa and produced in Africa by Africans.In another 702 interview Forbes Magazine editor, Chris Bishop said:"One morning we woke up and all of a sudden there’s this cover that we know nothing about, endorsing a drink that we know nothing about. People were asking me sending me messages about this cover and I had to say no, we know nothing about it. ” said Chris.“The cover in question was fabricated by DJ Sbu and is in no way an endorsement by Forbes Africa or its affiliates. The fabricated cover bares resemblance an October 28, 2013 Forbes US cover featuring Twitter CEO Disk Costolo,” said the magazine.Bishop said their legal team is writing to DJ Sbu about a cover depicting him posing with his new energy drink Mofaya on Forbes Africa.
HARARE residents are spoiling for a fight with the city council after the latter recently disconnected water supplies to 1 200 households mostly in Mbare and other high-density suburbs over unpaid bills, NewsDay has learnt.The disconnections targetted residents of Mbare National, Ardbennie, Avondale, Avonlea, Strathaven, Emerald Hill, Marlborough, Goodhope, Greencroft, Msasa Industry, Bluff Hill, Tynwald, Westlea, Mabelreign and Sunridge, most of whom have had erratic water supplies for the past few years.Angered by the move, the Harare Residents’ Trust (HRT) yesterday urged affected families to reconnect the water on their own, describing the disconnections as inhuman.HRT director Precious Shumba said: “As HRT, we urge every disconnected residents to reconnect their water. They have to make sure that each person gets at least 20 litres of water per day as stipulated by the United Nations Resolution A/RES/64/292. Council is trying to raise funds to finance the obscene salaries for people like town clerk Tendai Mahachi.”The move is also likely to put council on a collision course with Local Government minister Ignatius Chombo who recently ordered local authorities not to disconnect water supplies over unpaid bills.But, council spokesperson Michael Chideme told NewsDay that the decision to disconnect water came about after it was realised that some residents had stopped paying their water bills in July 2013.“Each defaulter is on average owing $500 while the majority have not paid a penny since July 2013 after the write-offs,” Chideme said.He said they would continue going around the capital city making sure that all defaulters were disconnected.“Yes, we can confirm that the city is going round disconnecting water for defaulters. The reason is we need money to finance service delivery. We are not able to provide water when people are not paying,” Chideme added.“We know it is a basic human right, but we need residents to appreciate that the provision has to be funded by the consumer. This is not a way of punishing people, but to encourage everyone with an overdue account to pay.”Chombo could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Tunisia’s Bardo museum has delayed its planned reopening after last week’s attack on foreign tourists due to security concerns, its head of communications, Hanene Srarfi, said.“We have been surprised at the last minute, but the interior ministry says that for security reasons we cannot receive a large number of visitors,” she told AFP on Tuesday.However, an official ceremony marking the reopening of the museum would still go ahead.Officials at the Bardo museum had planned to allow the public back in on Tuesday, six days after an attack that killed 21 people.“We have no date” for the reopening to the public, Srarfi said. “The interior and culture ministries decided that this afternoon would be an official event for the media and public figures … for the public it’s still too early,” Srarfi said.Tunisian authorities had announced at the weekend that the Bardo would reopen to the public on Tuesday, less than a week after two gunmen rampaged through the museum, killing 20 foreign tourists and a Tunisian policeman.The incident has raised deep fears for Tunisia’s crucial tourism industry.Officials have said there were security failures on the day of the attack on the museum, which is next to the Tunisian parliament.On Monday, the prime minister, Habib Essid, sacked the heads of police for Tunis and the area around the museum.
What concerns you most about your future health?Chances are it is not the condition of your heart or even the risk of cancer.Today, the greatest fear for people is that they may end their days slipping into dementia.The idea of losing control of one’s thoughts or being unable to remember loved ones causes understandable anxiety, and it happens to an increasing number of people.According to the Alzheimer’s Society there are already more than 800,000 people with dementia in the UK and that number is set to double over the next 35 years.Fears about becoming one of them has led to a surge of people turning up at dementia clinics.Figures published by the Royal College of Physicians earlier this month show there’s been a four-fold rise in the number of patients seeking help at these specialist centres.They’re anxious about their forgetfulness and unsure of what it means.So how can you tell if you — or someone close to you — is just a bit forgetful or in the early stages of dementia? And what can you do to cut your risk of developing the disease in the first place?Over the coming weeks, these questions and many more will be answered in this major Good Health series, helping you understand everything you need to know about this disease, its diagnosis and how best to treat it.We’ll also look at other conditions, from depression to thyroid problems, that are often wrongly diagnosed as dementia.And if you’re one of the legion of silent heroes caring for someone with dementia, we’ll also focus on how to cope with the challenges you face.As dementia becomes increasingly common, we all need to know how to live well with this disease...we hope to help you find the way.THERE ARE 200 TYPES OF DEMENTIADementia is not a single disease, but is an umbrella term for a group of conditions that damage the brain.In fact, there are more than 200 types of dementia. Alzheimer’s disease, which accounts for 60 to 70 per cent of cases, is the most common form.One of the main features of Alzheimer’s — and all forms of dementia — is that the brain shrinks. Initially this affects the hippocampus, the area of the brain associated with memory.There is also an overproduction of tau, the protein made by nerve cells in the brain to maintain their shape.The excess tau forms ‘tangles’, which affect the normal connections between neighbouring cells.In addition, there is a drop in acetylcholine, a chemical messenger vital for memory.Structures called amyloid plaques, clumps of a protein produced by nerve cells, are also found in the brains of those with Alzheimer’s.After Alzheimer’s, the next most common form of the condition is vascular dementia, which accounts for 20 per cent of cases and is linked to lifestyle — it’s a bit like heart disease of the brain.It occurs following a stroke or when the blood vessels supplying the brain become furred up or blocked.If blood supply is cut off to a part of the brain, the brain cells die off within just six minutes.With this, as with some other forms, there may be no memory loss at all — patients may, for example, have problems finding the right words to express themselves or have balance problems, making them prone to falls.Some people suffer from ‘mixed pattern’ dementia, a combination of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia.Whereas all forms of dementia involve some form of damage to the brain, what differentiates them is where that damage occurs.DO WE ALL GET IT EVENTUALLY?Dementia is not a normal part of ageing.It’s true that as we age, even healthy brains shrink from the age of 50.Between the ages of 50 to 65 the average brain may lose 4oz or 5oz in weight.The levels of chemical messengers, called neurotransmitters, also drop and the brain’s ability to absorb glucose, which it needs to function, is reduced.This is why some notice a slowing down of their mental functions or they can’t do things as quickly as they used to.This can lead to the ‘tip of the tongue’ problem when you can’t remember a word or name.This is incredibly common and in most cases does not mean that person is developing dementia.In dementia, the brain cells die off faster than they normally would and there will be greater shrinkage of the brain. This leads to a far more extreme deterioration than simple ageing.Why some people go on to develop dementia while many others don’t is not known for sure.Lifestyle factors such as having high blood pressure or raised cholesterol increase the risk, as does being a woman — two-thirds of people with dementia are female.Genetics can play a part — but only in a small percentage of cases.We will cover the various causes in more detail in the weeks to come.HOW CAN I TELL I'VE DEFINITELY GOT IT?This is the key question. There is no definitive test for dementia.The only way to know for sure if someone has had it is after death, in an autopsy.But doctors do use memory tests as a basic screening device to identify those who may be at risk.The test your GP is most likely to use is the Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test, developed in the U.S. in 1983 and updated as the 6CIT- Kingshill Version by Dr Patrick Brooke, a British GP.Here we reproduce the test, with the caveat that you should always see your GP with any concerns.Ask someone to put these questions to you and then score each answer to give a possible total out of 28.1. WHAT YEAR IS IT?2. WHAT MONTH IS IT?At this point in the test, a name and address is given and the person is asked to remember it. It should have five components, for example: Peter Smith, 56 High Street, Luton.3. WITHOUT LOOKING AT A CLOCK, WHAT TIME IS IT TO THE NEAREST HOUR?5.SAY THE MONTHS OF THE YEAR IN REVERSE ORDER6.TELL ME THE NAME AND ADDRESS I GAVE YOU EARLIER8-9 Some evidence of memory problems — see your GP.10-28 High evidence of memory impairment that needs further investigation.WHY DIAGNOSIS IS SO IMPORTANTAs most people know, there is no cure for dementia. But you shouldn’t think that this means getting diagnosed doesn’t matter.The expert view is that it’s vital to get a diagnosis in order to start getting support in place, especially as roughly a third of people with dementia live on their own.Also, there are drugs such as Aricept that can help to slow down the progression of Alzheimer’s disease.Getting the right diagnosis also matters if other conditions such as depression are compounding the underlying dementia — treatment for the depression, for instance, can make a big difference.Diagnosis also allows help — practical or financial — to be put in place.To get a diagnosis, the first port of call is your GP, who may carry out the Six Item Cognitive Impairment Test.After this, the GP may order blood tests to rule out other conditions such as a vitamin B12 deficiency, as the body needs this vitamin to make crucial brain chemicals.You may then be referred to a dementia or memory clinic; a co-ordinating centre with a full range of assessment, diagnostic, therapeutic and rehabilitation services able to accommodate the different types and the different severities.Here, further assessments will be done, and possibly also a brain scan that can rule out other causes of the symptoms and spot signs of shrinkage.This, however, may not be conclusive as in the early stages this shrinkage may not be obvious. So diagnosis may be delayed by months as doctors wait to see if the memory gets worse.Scientists are now working on new ways to try to improve the way dementia is diagnosed.Already in some European countries doctors are using lumbar punctures, where cerobrospinal fluid is removed from around the spinal column and tested.In this case, it is for the presence of two proteins — amyloid and tau — which are associated with Alzheimer’s, says Professor Simon Lovestone, professor of translational neuroscience at the University of Oxford, who is leading the trial.He adds that the tests are used in the UK but not widely.Professor Lovestone is heading an international collaboration funded by Alzheimer’s UK working on a simple blood test to confirm if memory lapses are early signs of dementia.Researchers have already identified proteins that if present in a blood test could predict those with memory problems most likely to develop dementia.‘We now know that there is a set of ten proteins that can predict whether someone with early symptoms of memory loss, or mild cognitive impairment, will develop dementia within a year, with a high level of accuracy of around 85 per cent,’ says Professor Lovestone.‘Our next step will be to test our findings in even larger sample sets, to further improve accuracy and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, before we can develop a reliable test suitable to be used by doctors.’It is not known when it will be available.Finding a new reliable test that can pinpoint the disease early could change the way the disease progresses.‘Alzheimer’s begins to affect the brain many years before patients are diagnosed with the disease. Many of our drug trials fail because by the time patients are given the drugs, the brain has already been too severely affected,’ says Professor Lovestone.He predicts that simple phone apps could be used in the future. ‘Apple has recently launched the M Power, which can help diagnose Parkinson’s disease by the way patients pronounce ‘Aah’ [changes in speech patterns can be a symptom of Parkinson’s disease].‘It’s possible a similar sort of screening tool could be developed for dementia, including Alzheimer’s.’A sniff test could also be on the horizon. It has been shown that the part of the brain involved in smell is one of the earliest areas to be affected in those with Alzheimer’s.Researchers have run a trial comparing how well people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease and people without the disease identify 12 aromas including banana, apple and motor oil on.The researchers, from the University of Leicester, found that those with Alzheimer’s were less able to identify the smells — and that the test could distinguish between those who had Alzheimer’s and those who did not with an accuracy of 86.7 per cent, according to data published in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease.The researchers say it may, in combination with other diagnostic tests, help to improve early detection of Alzheimer’s in the future.Dr Souter is a retired GP and fellow of the Royal College of General Practitioners.Adapted by LUCY ELKINS from Your Guide To Understanding And Dealing With Dementia by Dr Keith Souter, published by Summersdale, £8.99.

I kept saying, ‘Why me?’ It was a total shock. I mean, I wasn’t an "old" person.But looking back, I can see that I was having problems long before I was diagnosed.My boss had started pulling me up on minor things, such as grammatical errors, about six years before that.Three years later my GP diagnosed me with dysthymia — a form of depression. I thought it was just the stresses and strains of my life.My daughters Debbie, who’s 38, and Katy, who is 35, suspect I was simply misdiagnosed.At the time, I was aware I was becoming forgetful. I’d go upstairs, then forget what I’d gone up for.After my diagnosis of depression, I started going to my GP about my forgetfulness.Two years later, I was referred to a neurologist. I had memory tests, and scans that showed my brain had shrunk and the blood vessels leading to it had narrowed, which was highly abnormal for somebody my age. That was the main reason for my diagnosis of Alzheimer’s.They don’t know why I got it. I might just have unlucky genes.I’ve been on Aricept tablets since 2009 to try to delay the progress of the illness, but over the past five years my health has deteriorated noticeably.Just over a year ago my daughters got carers to come in to help with my meals after they started noticing that I would put things in the oven and forget about them.I also don’t go out by myself. A year ago, I went to the supermarket. I paid for the groceries, but just couldn’t work out how to get out of the store. I got terribly upset.Routine is crucial. I have a calendar to put all my appointments on. When I get up I circle that day, and notes remind me to take my purse and keys if I am leaving the house.I don’t want to sit at home feeling miserable. I have a bucket list that includes trips away, seeing musicals and going to the cinema. My mantra is to enjoy life while I can.Symptoms depend on the type of dementia and the area of the brain that is affected, but typical signs include:MEMORY PROBLEMS: When we talk about memory problems and dementia we basically mean short-term memory — that is, memory for recent events. Long-term memory — recalling something that happened 20 years ago with clarity — is the last to remain intact.This disparity comes about because when something gets committed to memory it gets imprinted on the circuits of the brain cells. The longer ago it is, the more it gets reinforced and imprinted. That’s why people with dementia can remember things from the past, even their childhood, but won’t recall what someone has just told them.Short-term memories by definition have not been imprinted, so when brain cells die off the most recent memories are lost because they are in the cells that go first.Not all memory problems are a sign of dementia. Issues with day-to-day memory can be a sign of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). This is not a diagnosis in itself — it can come about for a variety of reasons such as heart failure or diabetes, and only a small percentage of those with MCI will go on to develop full-blown dementia.To determine if someone has early dementia or MCI there needs to be a referral to a memory clinic for memory tests that will be repeated at a later date to see if there has been any deterioration — which might signify dementia.DIFFICULTY COMMUNICATING: Another possible sign of dementia is struggling to find the right word or finding conversations hard to follow. As a result, those affected retreat from conversations with family and friends. This occurs because the temporal lobe, the part of the brain which deals with language understanding, is commonly affected by the damage of dementia.STRUGGLING WITH EVERYDAY TASKS: Common actions such as driving can become difficult. It’s as if they forget the steps needed. As the condition worsens, even simple things such as unlocking a door may become confusing and sufferers may, for instance, put a meal in the fridge or milk in the oven.NOT KNOWING WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK IT IS: Losing a sense of time or place is another common symptom. People may lose track of the day, date month or even the year. They may also get disorientated, so that they can be confused about where they are, even when they are somewhere familiar to them.UNABLE TO CONCENTRATE: People with dementia often stop long-cherished hobbies that demand concentration, such as reading, crosswords, or even cooking, as they may find it hard to focus or concentrate.EMOTIONAL CHANGES: Sometimes dementia can change people’s personality, making stoical types weepy and tearful, and placid characters irritable. Unpredictable mood swings are another problem. Depression and anxiety are also common.REPETITIVE QUESTIONS: Some people get caught in the ‘loop phenomenon’, where they ask the same question or do the same action over and over again. Inappropriate behaviour can also occur. The person may shout, scream or become aggressive and suspiciousness is common.
An attack of the giggles can sometimes appear at the strangest moments.Whether it's during a speech or in a meeting, helpless laughter is one of our most insightful behaviours, according to neuroscientist Sophie Scott.In a recent Ted Talk in Vancouver, Professor Scott revealed that laughter often isn't to do with comedy value, but with our relationships with others.According to David Robson at BBC Future, Scott's study of people in Nambia revealed that laughter is a key cultural mechanism that helps social bonding.When Scott asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and describe the emotions, laughter was the most recognisable.'People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people's jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,' she told the BBC.The University College London professor's current research aims to distinguish the difference between fake laughs used during conversation, and involuntary giggles.She has carried out brain scans on volunteers listening to expressions of disgust, a real belly laugh and a realistic fake one.So far, her research has found that volunteers were almost always able to identify a false laugh.She has also discovered that less authentic tones are more nasal, and belly laughs never come through the nose.Meanwhile, MRI scans revealed how hearing real and fake laughter activates two different areas of our brains.Fake laughter triggers more brain activity – in the medial prefrontal cortex, associated with problem-solving – as we try to work out why the person is doing it.Genuine laughter simply activates auditory areas in the temporal lobe – where we process all sound.But both activate the brain's mirror regions that mimic other's actions, and she says this is the reason behind why laughing can be so contagious.'You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you're with someone else,' she claims.To further her work, Scott has recently set up an experiment at London's Science Museum, where she will be asking visitors to judge the authenticity of different clips of people laughing.And she believes far more research needs to be done on this cultural tic.'If you search on the Web of Science database for papers on the emotion of fear, you'll get back 6,477 published papers,' Professor Scott writes on Ted.'Search for papers on laughter and you'll get a paltry 175. Why the disparity? Well, one reason might be that laughter, like other positive emotions, feels less important than negative emotions.'Sometimes people think that laughter is a ridiculous, trite, pointless topic to research…I think it's a fascinating social behaviour, it is essential to study.'In a separate study last year, psychologist Dr Carolyn McGettigan from the Royal Holloway University of London measured brain responses of volunteers as they listened to genuine laughter on YouTube clips.Each participant was asked to pick clips they found funny.This ranged from comedy shows, such as Flight Of The Conchords, and even the Eurovision Song Contest.The results were then compared to how their brains responded to fake laughter.The findings revealed participants, none of which were told the study was about laughter perception, could unconsciously tell when the chuckles were insincere.Dr McGettigan said: 'It's fascinating to consider the way our brain is able to detect genuine happiness in other people. 'Our brains are very sensitive to the social and emotional significance of laughter.
The Walking Dead penultimate episode – Try – hit screens last night, and all of a sudden, it’s difficult to tell who the bad guys are anymore.Walkers are barely in episodes any more, but who cares about walkers? As anyone who watches the show knows, it’s the living you have to worry about.With only one episode left to go in season five, things are already balanced on a knife edge in the idyllic (for about five minutes) Alexandria.It looks like it’s all about to kick off inside the walls, never mind outside. And it’s all because we no longer know…We’ve seen Rick lose it a bit – and get it back for the most part – a couple of times over the last five or so seasons.He’s been through a lot in fairness, but come on, he’s the protagonist.Two things we can always be sure of: a) he’ll never die, and b) we’ll always root for him. But should we?He wasn’t in Alexandria five minutes and he was already planning to take it over. I honestly do not know what Deanna was thinking handing him essentially all the power over the entire community by letting him be one of two people allowed to carry a gun – the other being his lieutenant, Michonne – someone Deanna knew just as little about.If you think about it, Rick has been nothing but a disruptive influence since he got there. First, he’s hiding guns before he even goes into the place. Then he decides that he fancies the first woman he sets eyes on, even though she’s married with kids. He even kisses her at a party where literally the entire population of Alexandria was in the next room.Sure, his intentions to rescue Jessie are noble – he doesn’t want to see a woman getting battered, but really he just wants to get into her pants. He tells her as much, admitting he wouldn’t do this for just anyone. Only attractive ladies.And while Deanna’s reasoning might have seemed cold and cowardly on the face of it, she is justified in making that decision as a leader in the new world.Indeed Rick has made much colder decisions. Deanna is completely correct – Alexandria needs a surgeon, and while it’s tough on Jessie, she doesn’t seem to be complaining. It’s really not for Rick to decide – especially since his solution is ‘kill him’.No trial, don’t try intervene, talk to him, even beat him up – just straight up execute him. This simply is not how society works, pre or post apocalypse.Rick has already sewed his seeds of bad influence within his group, none more so than with Carol, whom he has robbing weapons and even chocolate.The fact can’t be ignored – Alexandria seemed to be doing just fine before Rick got there… and it looks like Michonne agrees with me.Plus some other unanswered questions from the penultimate episode:How did Nicholas find Rick’s gun? And what is he planning on doing with it?What was the story with that balloon? They even have helium tanks in there?Who leaves a tuna casserole on a bereaved person’s front door, rings the bell and then runs?People get killed EVERY WEEK sneaking around with weapons drawn in The Walking Dead – just how stupid are Carl and Enid to be running around in the forest?What is the problem with Sasha hunting walkers? isn’t that the point?Why the hell would Sam run to Carol during the fight? She threatened to feed him to zombies!And what is the story with these W guys? That girl was alive when they fed her to the walkers! that’s pretty grim, even for this show.MORE: The Walking Dead season 5 episode 14: 8 unanswered questions from Spend
Heavy rainfall that hit commuters on Tuesday afternoon saw the day notched up as the wettest so far this month, with up to 26 millimetres of rain falling in some parts of the city by 7pm.Commuters faced a miserable trip home after rain passed over the city just as the work day ended. In 10 minutes from 4.40pm, five millimetres of rain fell on the city, taking the total since 9am to 16.4 millimetres. Sydney Olympic Park had recorded 21.6 millimetres and Prospect Reserve 26 millimetres.By 7pm Tuesday had already become the wettest day of the month, surpassing March 2, when 11.4 millimetres of rain fell. Intermittent heavy rainfall as well as thunder and lightning was expected to continue until about 9pm and deliver up to 30 millimetres of rain across the Sydney metropolitan area, Bureau of Meteorology forecaster Mohammad Nabi said."There will be another five to 15 millimetres [overnight], picking up the number to 30 millimetres for several locations across the metro area," Mr Nabi said."We've got decent rainfall falling throughout the metro area, and we keep hearing thunder and seeing flashes of lighting - that's all as per forecasts and this will carry on for at least another three to four hours into the evening, and start easing off from about 9pm.By 5pm, the State Emergency Service had recieved 36 calls for help, mainly from the Illawarra region."It doesn't look like anything too intense at this stage. We've had a few leaky roofs, a few sandbagging requests and a few fallen branches," an SES spokeswoman said."Numbers of calls may increase, but it looks like the worst of the weather has passed."The bureau expects the weather to improve on Wednesday and then be largely fine for the rest of the month."Come tomorrow we'll just be left with a change, and early shower, but no thunderstorms," Mr Nabi said, predicting the rest of the week would be fine with a chance of rain on Sunday.Outside Sydney, a severe thunderstorm warning was issued for parts of the Hunter, Central Tablelands, North West Slopes and Plains and Central West Slopes and Plains. The wild weather could affect people in Scone, Mudgee, Tamworth, Gunnedah, Narrabri and Coonabarabran."A line of thunderstorms has developed west of Coonabarabran. This line of thunderstorms has the potential to produce severe thunderstorms with damaging winds, large hailstones and heavy rainfall that may lead to flash flooding," the bureau said in a statement Tuesday.
The Thai industries sentiment index (TISI) dropped for the second consecutive month in February to 88.9 from 91.1 in January as businesses of all sizes expressed concern about an economic slowdown.Supant Mongkolsuthree, chair of the Federation of Thai Industries (FTI), said on Tuesday that the index was based on a survey on 1,168 operators.The index over the next three months also fell from 100.4 in January to 99.2 in February. It was below 100 for the first time in 10 months.Mr Supant said small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large operators were concerned about the sluggish economy, delayed spending and weak purchasing power.He urged the government to quickly disburse budgets, find new export markets and facilitate border trade.In February, automobile output was 175,351 units, rising by 2.79% year-on-year. Of the total, 108,731 were exported, up by 11.32%. Domestic sales were 63,948 units, down 10.8% year-on-year but up 7.08% from January.
A YORK man who was arrested on suspicion of murdering Claudia Lawrence remains in custody this morning.North Yorkshire Police arrested the man, aged in his 50s, in the York area yesterday, and searches were taking place at a house near the city throughout the day.Police said yesterday the searches could last several days, but have this morning confirmed the searches at that property have concluded. It is not yet clear whether further searches are taking place at other locations in connection with the arrest.
Dakar - Karim Wade, the son of former Senegal president Abdoulaye Wade bidding to follow his father to the top office, was sentenced to six years in prison on Monday in a deeply divisive graft case.The flamboyant former minister was found guilty of "illicit enrichment" and fined the equivalent of more than 210 million euros ($230 million). His assets are also to be confiscated.He was however cleared of the main corruption charge -- initially said to involve one billion euros but later whittled down to 105 million euros -- by a special anti-corruption court in Dakar.The ruling came just two days after the opposition Democratic Party of Senegal (PDS) chose the 46-year-old as its candidate for the country's next presidential election, a date for which has yet to be set.Sympathisers have long condemned the corruption case against the younger Wade as politically motivated and when the verdict was read out it in court it was met with cries of dismay from dozens of opposition supporters, with some breaking down in tears.Outside the courtroom, supporters overturned garbage bins and set fire to a tyre before being dispersed by police firing tear gas."This is a political sentencing. They have for a long time been trying to stop our candidate from contesting the presidential election," said Oumar Sarr, a senior official from Wade's party.But government spokesman Oumar Youm said the court's decision must be respected. "Justice has spoken," he told the private RFM radio.With tempers running high, Justice Minister Sidiki Kaba later told reporters that the conviction would not affect Wade's civic rights, allowing him to pursue his presidential bid.The minister added that the judges had reached their decision independently and the case was not part of a "political plan to bring down an adversary".Wade's lawyer Mohamed Seydou Diagne told AFP he would appeal to the Supreme Court in a bid to have the ruling annulled.Wade himself was not present in court but his father, who will soon turn 89, showed up for the verdict. He dismissed the court's ruling as a "charade", according to local media.There was tight security in the building with police and gendarmes deployed both outside and inside.Senegal's President Macky Sall, who beat Abdoulaye Wade in a tight election in 2012, had warned that his government would stifle any unrest provoked by the court ruling.Karim Wade went on trial in July 2014 charged with illegally acquiring companies and real estate while serving in various government posts during his father's 12-year presidency.He has been in custody since April 2013, with prosecutors demanding a seven-year prison term.After a successful career in finance in London, Karim Wade returned to Senegal two years after his father's 2000 presidential victory and was soon tapped for a series of increasingly important public positions.Those included simultaneous appointments to key ministerial portfolios, earning him the nickname "minister of heaven and Earth".He was also chosen to head the National Agency for the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (ANOCI), which successfully oversaw the transformation of Dakar in time to host the 11th Islamic Summit of 57 Muslim countries in 2008 -- but was also criticised for a lack of financial transparency.Backed by his father, Wade was also selected to oversee the construction of a new international airport in Dakar, the restructuring of Senegal's chemical industry and the creation of a special economic zone.But the younger Wade, whose mother Viviane is French, also inspired mistrust and derision among voters over his long stays in Europe and his lack of mastery of the country's main language Wolof.Voters made their disdain clear in 2009, when Wade campaigned to become the mayor of Dakar -- a bid interpreted as setting the stage for higher national political ambitions, but which resulted in an electoral drubbing.
Madrid - Real Madrid have suspended a club member and banned him from their installations pending an inquiry after three men insulted players and struck at least one of their vehicles as they were leaving the training ground on Sunday.Players including Wales winger Gareth Bale and forward Jese were targeted along with coach Carlo Ancelotti after they arrived back in Madrid following their 2-1 defeat at Barcelona in the La Liga 'Clasico'.Footage published in Spanish media showed one man striking Jese's car window and yelling insults. When Bale and Ancelotti left they were also insulted and two men tried to punch and kick Bale's vehicle as security guards looked on.Sergio Ramos, one of the club captains, briefly stopped to ask the men what they were doing before driving on.Real said on their website on Monday one of the three men had been identified as a club member and had been suspended pending a disciplinary committee hearing which would decide whether or not to expel him.Also read: Spurs star Mason gets first England call-up"Real Madrid has also informed the National Antiviolence Commission of the incidents and identified the perpetrators, asking that the sanctions they consider appropriate be applied," they added.Real's defeat at the Nou Camp left them four points behind leaders Barca with 10 games left.
JOHANNESBURG - Dozens of people living at the Marlboro Gardens Stadium on Monday said the government they voted for has turned its back on them.Almost 100 people have been ordered to vacate the area after living there for two months.They were initially evicted from a block of flats in Alexandra.The community gathered to sing and pray in efforts to comfort each other and ask God to help them with their situation.Mothers living in the stadium hall which is separated into three sections have pleaded for sympathy from government.PICTURE: Some evictees sat outside the stadium hall singing and dancingMother of three, Mabel Ntuli, said she works as a cleaner and doesn’t earn enough to rent or buy a home.Community member Agnes Mothapo said she's heartbroken because she too has children and worries about the ill and elderly living at the stadium.“It’s very painful, this won’t be happening if they kept to their promises.”Government has initiated a meeting with the Marlboro Gardens community to find an amicable solution.
NATIONAL NEWS - Two teenagers were arrested in connection with the murder of a 15-year-old school pupil in Gingindlovu, KwaZulu-Natal police said on Tuesday."Two suspects aged 18 and 19 were traced and arrested after they were located to a homestead in Gingindlovu where they were hiding," said spokesman Colonel Jay Naicker.The victim was returning home from school last week with his friends when they were attacked by pupils from another school, Naicker said."He was stabbed and taken to hospital where he later died.

Cape Town - Without clear policy changes to create economic opportunities for all, the City of Cape Town’s new anti-racism campaign could end up being nothing more than a “talk shop”, says the Institute for Race Relations.And the ANC in the city has called on the South African Human Rights Commission to intervene and lead the campaign, as they claim mayor Patricia de Lille is unable to reach out to the broader community.Mienke Steytler, spokeswoman for the institute, said: “Talking and getting people together is important but changing people’s lives is what will really matter. And that will only happen when they have jobs and can live dignified and true lives.“The main issue is economic inequality - the more unequal South African society becomes, the more likely racial incidents are.”The ANC’s Tony Ehrenreich said that while race was an important issue in the city, it would take more than a few “posters and pamphlets” to break down the divides.“The mayor can’t even talk to the ANC in the City of Cape Town, how will she be able to reach out to the broader community?”Ehrenreich said the anti-racism campaign needed to be non-partisan and above party politics. The ANC wanted the commission to convene the anti-racism dialogue.“De Lille is trying to politicise the issue of race relations. It is a reflection of how she engages publically.”While commission spokesman Isaac Mangena did not comment on the commission’s possible involvement, he said: “Racism is a national problem affecting every citizen in this country. And as the commission we welcome any efforts by groups or individuals to come up with solutions to deal with this problem. We should all work towards ridding our nation of all racial prejudices, and for once forget about political affiliations, and join hands to deal with what is becoming a national problem.”At the launch of the Inclusive City campaign on Human Rights Day on Saturday, De Lille acknowledged that “campaigns such as these sometimes have a tendency to fix everything”.Policy interventions, such as free and subsidised basic services to poorer residents, would address material conditions in the city, while the campaign would encourage “constructive dialogue” about racism and include discussions about prejudice and racism with the property, hospitality, university, media and retail sectors.De Lille later wrote an open letter to Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa, asking him to show evidence of the racist incidents in Cape Town that he referred to during a parliamentary question last week.That sparked outrage on social media,but De Lille said on Monday she wanted Ramaphosa to provide details so that the city could work with him to deal with the problem. She referred again to her earlier statement that she would “use that evidence in my engagements and take direct action”.“It is up to our country’s leaders to provide direction on these matters. I take your allegations seriously and ask you to join me in tackling these issues head-on.”Vuyisa Qabaka, director of the South African Black Entrepreneurship Forum, took up the debate on social media. “The city’s campaign is deserving of our collective support, but I’m not sure that the campaign goes far enough. I fear that the campaign is a self-serving, box-ticking exercise that will not resolve the issue.”Qabaka said numerous incidents of racism were being dealt with in the Wynberg Magistrate’s Court while complaints involving an upmarket hotel and a Kloof Street nightspot were still unresolved. Cases included the assault of a gardener by a white motorist and allegations that a 19-year-old urinated on a black taxi driver from the balcony of a nightclub in Claremont.De Lille said the city would share information about individual rights as part of its campaign. “We want people to know that they cannot be discriminated against, that their dignity must be protected and respected and that they can associate with whomever they want.”But the campaign has been slammed as an election ploy by the Western Cape ANC, whose deputy secretary, Maurencia Gillion, said: “The ANC Western Cape welcomes any dialogue on racism as it is a monster destroying the roots of the young tree of our democracy and moral fibre. There is however something fishy about the DA’s latest gimmick on this issue.”Steytler said the campaign was commendable since it included many sectors in finding solutions. But the Institute of Race Relations wanted it to include the police and politicians – those with “political will” and “citizens’ safety in their hands”.Without policy reforms that created jobs, improved access to education and empowered citizens, racial tension would continue. Through these reforms the equality gap would start to close, leading to less frustration, tension and anger, which were expressed as racial incidents.
The parties appeared before a full bench of three judges in the High Court in Pretoria on Monday to decide on a report by Prof Ann Skelton of the Centre for Child Law.She investigated the case, and together with three of the parents and experts recommended that each child remain with the family who raised them.The fourth parent, a father, said he had never met his biological daughter, nor did he take part in the therapy sessions as others did, according to the report.He asked the court to postpone the case for three months as he wanted to consult his own psychologist and a traditional expert.The father said the son he was raising had to undergo certain cultural rituals, but did not know how to go about the matter as he is Zulu and the son was of a different culture. He wanted advice from an expert in this regard.The children, a boy and a girl, would turn five in August.Two East Rand mothers learnt their babies were swapped in 2010 at the Tambo Memorial Hospital in Boksburg.This emerged when one of the mothers tried to claim maintenance from the man she believed was her son's father.Paternity tests revealed that not only was he not the boy's father, but she was not his mother.
Most debts, such as clothing accounts, cellphones and credit card debt, prescribe after three years - if there has been no payment or acknowledgement of it and no summons in respect of it - and the consumer is then not obliged to pay the debt.
Hobart Victoria have endured a nightmare day four of the Sheffield Shield final, losing James Pattinson to an injury that  clouds expectations of his winter return to the Test team and allowing Western Australia to surge back into contention to win the shield title.The Bushrangers' position at the start of day four, at 3-288 and needing only to occupy the crease, was unrecognisable to what they confronted at the end of it: a 280-run deficit against a team driven to complete the perfect record of West Australian teams this summer, after the Matador Cup and Big Bash League. The equation for the final day is clear. If the Warriors snare the Bushrangers' final 10wickets before the target is reached they win the shield. The Bushrangers must either pass the target of grind out a draw.Their ability to do the latter is in question after their concession of 7-93 on the first half of day four that allowed the Warriors to earn a 40-run innings lead and then race to 2-240 by stumps, thanks largely to a rapid drought-breaking century from opener Marcus Harris, who finished unbeaten on 129. There are 104 overs  due to be bowled on the final day, less two for changeover if the Warriors do not declare overnight.The outlook for Pattinson, beyond being available to bat in Victoria's second innings, is much less clear. He was forced into an early exit from the bowling crease after an apparent recurrence of the hamstring injury he suffered on February 27 and had been cleared to return from in order to play in the shield final.Pattinson was midway through the second over of his second spell when he aborted his run-in just before his delivery stride. Even though there was only one more ball to be bowled before tea the 24-year-old immediately turned and left the field. The Bushrangers confirmed the cause of Pattinson's exit was a "slight hamstring injury", again in his left leg.While the right-armer was delighted to return for the shield final the match had, even before the suspected injury, not been a good one for him. He had not taken a wicket in his 31.5 overs across both innings and had been his team's most expensive bowler. He had nevertheless bowled with good pace.Expectations at the start of the day that the match would peter out into a draw were challenged in the seventh over as Marcus Stoinis was bowled for 47 by Ashton Agar and captain Matthew Wade was trapped leg-before from the next delivery.The Bushrangers then benefited from a 39-run partnership compiled over 18 overs that looked to have steadied their innings. It ended when Peter Handscomb gave Nate Rimmington a return catch for 48. Daniel Christian (27) and Peter Siddle (three) also fell before lunch amid the disciplined Warriors bowling.That four of the five wickets came in the first over of the bowling spell was a tick for the captaincy of Adam Voges.After lunch the Bushrangers managed only 22 runs for the final two wickets before being dismissed for 381. From there on, the WA batsmen, especially Harris, furthered their team's position.Cameron Bancroft made a typically gritty 38 from 89 balls and Michael Klinger a busy 56 from 56.Left-hander Harris  brought up his century off just 107 balls. It was his first in the shield since November 2012. Since that milestone he had averaged just 20.28, reaching 50 in just two of his 37 innings.In the final, however, he has justified his selection with his dashing century in the second innings and 81 in the first.

Bangkok - The slump in global natural rubber prices is probably over because producers are finding it harder to cover their costs and will cut output, according to Michelin & Cie, Europe’s largest tyremaker.Rates have reached a floor of about $1.50 a kilogram, Luc Minguet, senior vice-president and chief procurement officer, said in an interview in Singapore on March 23. Futures averaged $1.584 in the past year and were at $1.431 on Monday.“At this level of prices, we see supply starting to adjust, simply because people at plantations cannot make a living,” Minguet said. “They reduce their production.”Futures have tumbled 75 percent from a record in 2011 as maturing trees boost latex output and the economy of China, the world’s biggest consumer, expands at the slowest pace since 1990. The plunge has cut costs for tyremakers such as Michelin and Goodyear Tyre & Rubber Company, and spurred efforts by Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia to limit supplies.Prices on the Singapore Exchange for technically specified rubber used in the tyre industry fell 5.5 percent this year, extending four annual losses, after reaching a peak of $5.75 in February 2011. Output from new plantations rose in 2013 and 2014 and demand was a little lower than expected, said Minguet, who is scheduled to speak at a Singapore conference on Wednesday.An expansion of plantations across Southeast Asia from 2004 to 2011 has caused a supply surplus from 2011 through 2016, according to the Singapore-based International Rubber Study Group. The glut is poised to drop to 51 000 metric tons next year from 77 000 tons in 2015, it estimates.Global demand for tyres will probably expand about 2 percent to 5 percent in the next five years because mobility is important for people and the number of cars will increase, said Minguet, who’s been with Michelin for 12 years. Tyres account for 70 percent of natural rubber demand, the IRSG estimates.Fluctuating oil prices and the “gloomy situation” in China are among factors that make the outlook for 2015 unclear, Minguet said. China’s economy has cooled as officials rein in local-government debt, crack down on graft and strengthen environmental laws. The targeted expansion of about 7 percent this year would be the smallest increase since 1990.The market should be “very, very close” to balance this year or next, said Jean-Noel Quillet, managing director of Michelin’s unit in Singapore which procures natural rubber for the group. “There’s an adjustment going on.”Global sales of light vehicles and trucks weighing less than six tons will probably rise 3.5 percent to a record 90 million units in 2015 and increase a further 4.9 percent next year, May Arthapan, a Bangkok-based director at LMC Automotive Thailand, said in an email on March 18. Sales in Asia will expand 5.3 percent to an all-time high of 40 million units, data show.“Tyre manufacturers are concerned that prices are so low because there is a risk that plantations will be dug out,” said David Shaw, head of research at UK-based Tyre Industry Research. “We’ll see an increase in production of tires as time goes on and if natural rubber isn’t available, that increases business risks,” he said in an interview on March 23.While tyre sales for trucks and passenger cars grow slightly in North America and are flat in Europe, car tyre sales continue to increase in new markets such as China, India, Southeast Asia, Brazil and Mexico, Minguet said.“We are willing to grow in China, and we are growing in China,” Minguet said. “We have significant investment plans in China, both for passenger car and truck tyres,” he said, without elaborating. Passenger car tyres contribute about half of Michelin’s sales and truck tyres about a third, he said.
Johannesburg - Eugene de Kock’s lawyer is still trying to find him.On Monday, Pretoria lawyer Julian Knight again wrote to Minister of Correctional Services Michael Masutha, asking for De Kock to be released on parole.Knight disputed comments attributed to the minister that De Kock had been released on parole, saying that was untrue and contrary to instructions he had received from De Kock.Knight said his client “has not yet been provided with his parole conditions, assigned a parole officer and/or transferred to community corrections for placement and monitoring”.On Friday, The Star independently confirmed that De Kock had not been handed over to Correctional Services’ community corrections centre or assigned a parole officer.Knight believes that De Kock is in the custody of the State Security Agency (SSA).“Having our client transferred to the care of the State Security Agency does not constitute release on parole,” Knight wrote to the minister.He again warned the ministry that he would bring an urgent application to have De Kock produced before a court so that the court could decide on the legality of his continued detention.Last week, the SSA referred queries from The Star to Correctional Services, while the SAPS eventually said it did not have him in custody.On January 30, Masutha publicly announced that he had approved De Kock’s parole application.Masutha was quoted in The Times on Monday as insisting that De Kock is out on parole.“I can confirm that he is out on parole,” he reportedly told the newspaper.In response to queries from The Star last week, Justice Ministry spokesman Mthunzi Mhaga would not say what had happened to De Kock.“We have acceded to Mr De Kock’s plea not to give details of his release, so no media enquiries will be entertained on his release except queries on the minister’s decision on his parole,” said Mhaga at the time.The ministry has ignored further requests for comment since then.He was the commander of the secret police hit squad unit based at Vlakplaas near Pretoria, and was sentenced to two life terms plus 212 years for various offences, including murder. He was subsequently granted amnesty on some matters.
Drivers had a return to winter this morning, as many early morning commuters had to dig the deicer out for their cars.Despite temperatures rising to their highest point of the year so far at the weekend, it was back to frost this morning.But the sun soon melted the frost, leaving a clear and bright Tayside.Throughout the day the mercury will rise, bringing with it some rain before the cold sets back in tonight.And the Met Office is predicting the chilly starts will last until the end of the week, with rain during the day.A forecast for Tayside on the Met Office website for Wednesday to Saturday said: “A frosty start then a dry day with long periods of sunshine. Feeling on the cool side with a southeasterly breeze picking up in the afternoon.“Cloudy Thursday with patchy rain and hill snow, becoming drier. Dry, cold start Friday but patchy rain spreading eastwards. Mainly dry with sunny spells on Saturday.”
When Kevin Crook began to suffer debilitating cluster headaches in January this year, he admits he has never felt pain like it.“I can barely describe the pain,” admits the 48-year-old from Wolverhampton. “It’s like someone is trying to gouge your eye out and at the same time trying to stick a red hot poker in your temple. A migraine is like a walk in the park, in comparison .“It’s a little known medical condition and there are very few experts out there, so I’m very lucky to have seen Julie.”Kevin has been unable to continue his work as a maintenance technician since his diagnosis in January because of the daily agony that the cluster headaches bring.But things are already looking up since he was referred to Julie Edwards, a clinical nurse specialist for headache at City Hospital, Birmingham.“The medication my GP gave me wasn’t helping me and someone I know who works at City Hospital told me about Julie and said she was highly recommended,” he says. “I went back to my doctor to see if I could go and see her and it was sorted within just a few days.”At his initial consultation, he underwent numerous tests and Julie also checked his medication, and recommended changes to help keep his condition under control.“She is incredibly caring and since my first meeting with her, she has phoned several times to see if I’m OK and checking up on me,” says Kevin, who is married to Tina. “She is an angel.”“I went on a forum called ouch.co.uk for sufferers of cluster headaches and asked about the treatment I was getting. When I mentioned Julie’s name, many of them said how lucky I was to have her treat me because she is one of very few people who understand the condition.”The past three months have been very stressful for Kevin and Tina but he says that Julie’s reassurance and pro-active approach to treatment has given them hope that he will soon be able to live as normal life as possible again.“She told me she has a Plan A and a Plan B. For me, and people like me, she is a godsend,” added Kevin. “The work that she and most other nurses do is completely overlooked. They really care and deserve recognition for what they do .”When Frederick underwent treatment for stomach cancer in March 2011, he couldn’t have been in better hands, he says.The chemotherapy nursing team at Heartlands Hospital who looked after him were “worth their weight in gold”.“I was a guinea pig and underwent experiments with numerous drugs and various new medication and research into beating this dreadful disease,” says the 81-year-old from Sheldon.“At one stage of my treatment I spent 14 hours in the outpatients – ward 19 – being drip fed medication.“I had to extend my time by some of three hours but the nurse would not end her 12 hour shift until my medication was consumed. This meant my nurse was obliged to work three hours without being paid.“All the medical team were are superb but the nurses work very long shifts and I had very good treatment throughout. I am extremely grateful for all the help that this team gave me through my treatment.”Since undergoing surgery four years ago, Frederick, who lives with his wife Wendy, aged 79, he has returned every 12 months for a check-up, when he has continued to receive excellent care.“People moan about their jobs and working long hours, but they should see what nurses do,” he says. “They deserve the award.”HOW TO NOMINATE YOUR NURSING STARDo you know a nurse who repeatedly goes the extra mile?

Cancer survival rates in Britain lag more than ten years behind those in many other European countries, experts warn.Even for breast cancer – one of the most treatable forms of the disease – the figures are still well below those reached by France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s.For lung cancer, the rates are so far behind that patients in Britain are now half as likely to survive as those living in Austria.Macmillan Cancer Support has described the situation as ‘shameful’ and warns too many patients are dying needlessly here when they would survive had they been treated elsewhere in Europe.And despite billions being spent to improve cancer survival rates over the last 15 years – £640million invested by Labour in the early 2000s and £750million by the Tories – Britain does not appear to have gained any ground.In 2002 Labour increased National Insurance tax by 1 per cent as part of a budget introduced by then Chancellor Gordon Brown specifically to pay for major improvements in the NHS, notably cancer care.But only this month figures showed that waiting times for scans are at their highest in seven years while a report by MPs warned of ‘unacceptable’ variation in care.Data analysed by Macmillan shows that 81 per cent of breast cancer sufferers in Britain survive five years. This is a lower rate than France, Sweden and Italy in the late 1990s, when the figure was 83 per cent.In these countries the survival rates are now 86 per cent or higher. For bowel cancer, 54 per cent of Britons can expect to survive five years, whereas in the late 1990s it was already 59 per cent in Finland and 55 per cent in Norway, the Netherlands and France.The five-year survival rate for lung cancer here is currently 10 per cent but in several countries, including Austria, Germany and Italy, it was at 11 per cent by the late 1990s.Lynda Thomas, chief executive of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘Frankly, this is shameful. What we can see here is that better cancer survival rates are not unachievable.‘If countries like Sweden, France, Finland and Austria can achieve these rates, then the UK can, and should, bridge the gap.’ Experts are not sure why our figures remain so far behind but it may partly be that doctors are not detecting the illness early enough, before it has spread to other organs.It may also be down to patients not being offered the newest, most effective drugs nor the latest surgical procedures, which are routinely available in other countries.This is particularly true for the elderly who are often denied chemotherapy or surgery on the grounds that they are considered too frail.Experts are worried improvements made to survival rates have stalled because the NHS cannot cope with the ever-increasing numbers being diagnosed with cancer.It is estimated that about half of us will get cancer at some point in our lifetimes.The figures are taken from a comparison of survival rates of European countries carried out by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, known as the ‘Concord programme’.Meanwhile, the latest monthly NHS statistics showed 18,740 patients waited longer than six weeks for tests to diagnose cancer such as X-rays, CT scans or ultrasounds – up 40 per cent in a year and the worst figure since February 2008.It follows a report by MPs warning of ‘unacceptable’ and ‘unexplained’ variation in cancer detection and treatment across England – particularly for the elderly.Sean Duffy, of NHS England, said: ‘We are diagnosing and treating more people than ever before and as a result the NHS is helping more people than ever survive cancer.’
Honda took a prototype of the new Honda Type R and flung it around in just 7:50.63, trouncing the record for a front wheel drive previously held by the Renault Megane RS 275 Trophy-R which had stood at 7:54.36.This year Scots driver Gordon Shedden and his partner Matt Neal will transfer into the Honda Type R for the BTCC after giving up the estates they were racing in last season and they are not surprisingly hoping for glory.To celebrate the achievement of the Type R which has 306hp under the bonnet and a top speed of 170 mph, Honda are inviting Type R owners and fans to the Ring for a special weekend in May to watch a WTCC race.The entry price of the ticket will include a VIP pass allowing access to the paddock, a hands-on experience with the new Type R and a Q&A session with drivers, Gabriele Tarquini and Tiago Monteiro.Now watch that Type R on the Ring.
A BOOK aimed at fulfilling posthumously a wish from former president Nelson Mandela is to be published in 2016, publisher Pan Macmillan said on Tuesday.Mandela died on December 5 2013 at home in Houghton, Johannesburg. He was 95 and a world figure who had spent his childhood in rural SA and had been incarcerated for 27 years at the hands of the country’s apartheid regime. He won the Nobel Peace Prize, jointly with SA’s last apartheid president FW de Klerk, in 1993.Pan Macmillan described the book as a sequel to Mandela’s autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom.The book, still untitled, would fulfil Mandela’s dream of publishing a full account of his years as SA’s first democratically elected president, 1994-99. Pan Macmillan said the book came partly from the wish of Mandela’s widow, Graça Machel, to fulfil this dream. It is to be compiled from his personally written but incomplete draft of the book and from the archives held by the Nelson Mandela Foundation."The sequel to Long Walk to Freedom will not only tell Mandela’s story from his release (from Pollsmoor Prison) to his retirement from government, but it will also be a rallying cry that will remind readers everywhere what he stood for — and how it is still possible for his vision and his political philosophy positively to change not only SA but the world," said Pan Macmillan editorial director Georgina Morley."Madiba started working on a manuscript provisionally titled The Presidential Years in 1998," Ms Machel said in an embargoed statement from Pan Macmillan. "He wanted to put on record his own reflections of those important years (1994-99) when he was President of SA. The book he had in mind was to be a natural progression from his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom. Circumstances did not allow him to complete the project. I am very pleased that a team comprising former senior advisors of his have accepted the responsibility for completing this unfinished task on his behalf."Pan Macmillan obtained UK and Commonwealth Rights to the sequel to Long Walk to Freedom from Jonny Geller at Curtis Brown, representing the Nelson Mandela Foundation and PQ Blackwell.Pan Macmillan had "already had the privilege of working with the Nelson Mandela Foundation on three books", said Ms Morley. These were Conversations with Myself; Nelson Mandela By Himself: The Authorised Book of Quotations; and Long Walk to Freedom (the picture book).
BEIJING - In China, few activities escape the watchful eye of the state -- and soon, that will include square dancing.Ever-growing numbers of enthusiastic dancers -- usually "damas", or elderly women -- have gathered on the street corners of China's cities in recent years to gyrate in unison.Often clad in matching outfits and wielding fans or other props, they gather around dinnertime, performing choreographed moves to sometimes thumping dance music piped through a portable boombox -- or even a live band.But if the General Administration of Sport and the Ministry of Culture have their way, the nightly routine will be strictly regulated."Square dancing represents the collective aspect of Chinese culture, but now it seems that the overenthusiasm of participants has dealt it a harmful blow with disputes over noise and venues," fitness official Liu Guoyong told the state-run China Daily newspaper Tuesday.Liu is the chief of the General Administration of Sport's mass fitness department."So, we have to guide it with national standards and regulations," he said.According to the China Daily, Chinese authorities have hired an "expert panel" to choreograph 12 state-approved square dances.The dances "will be introduced to local fitness sites in 31 provinces and municipalities in the next five months", the newspaper said, adding that authorities have yet to decide standards on music volume, dance times and venues.Square dancing has become an improbably hot topic in China, with stories on dancing "damas" -- not all of them flattering -- lighting up state media.Some urban dwellers have complained that the elderly groovers blast their music until late at night, disturbing the peace and quiet of local residents.In the central Chinese city of Wuhan, a simmering dispute between enthusiastic "damas" and their irritated neighbours made headlines in 2013 when the residents threw coins, rocks -- and ultimately, faeces -- at the group in a bid to make them stop.Last year, photos of a group of middle-aged Chinese women performing a square dance routine outside the Louvre in Paris set off a debate over whether the pastime had gone too far.A video of several women attempting to perform a square dance on board a crowded passenger train in China went viral last year, sparking further controversy."All the negative comments on square-dancing are about reckless practising without caring about the public benefits," fitness trainer and square dancing expert Wang Guangcheng told the China Daily."The unified drills will help keep the dancing on the right track where they can be performed in a socially responsible way," he added.
No need to incur debt to get good matric resultsIS IT advisable for SA’s fledgling black middle class to invest hundreds of thousands of rand a year in their children’s education at expensive private schools?After many conversations on this question, I am starting to sympathise with the view that spending R150,000 to R200,000 a year on a child’s education is unnecessary. One can get a good and competitive education by paying, at most, in the lower tens of thousands of rand. Also, it is possible for children to get distinctions without their parents investing vast amounts. In fact, children in cheaper schools can perform better than many whose parents have invested hundreds of thousands in posher schools.Here is an example. Khulekane Madi, a 20-year-old from Tshepisong, Soweto, scored only 30% in grade 10 mathematics and 20% for accounting, yet in matric he got 100% in the accounting exam and 94% for maths. Madi was able to improve his marks by taking extra lessons offered by the Kutlwanong Centre for Maths, Science and Technology, a nonprofit organisation founded in 2001 by former school principal Tumelo Mabitsela. The cost of these extra lessons were paid by a number of private companies, including Investec.Mondli Guliwe, 23, another graduate of the programme, says when he was young he did not want to study at university. Guliwe, who was raised on his grandmother’s pension, matriculated at the PJ Simelane High School, where his tuition cost about R400 a year. Guliwe was getting 30%-40% for maths when he started extra lessons in the second half of grade 10. In grade 11, he was getting about 60% and in grade 12 he was getting As.There are many other examples of children from poor communities who have excelled through extra lessons.Take Kagiso Trust’s Beyers Naudé Schools Development Programme in the Free State, which has been intervening at previously underperforming schools. In 2013, a number of its schools in the Free State made the province’s top 10 in mathematics, accounting and physical science.All these examples and many others show that if parents take a keen interest in their child’s education and supplement it with extra lessons, there is no need to incur debt to get good matric results.So what are people buying from expensive schools if children in townships are also getting distinctions? Many will argue that it is not only the education, but the access to networks. Some of these expensive schools enrol children of CEOs and senior politicians and some parents buy access to this exclusive club. I find this "access" issue problematic since much of the emerging talent in businesses in a transforming SA does not come from very expensive schools.Take Funeka Montjane and Themba Baloyi, for example, two of the three South Africans who made it into the World Economic Forum Young Global Leaders class of 2015. They come from very disadvantaged backgrounds. A chartered accountant by qualification, Montjane grew up poor in KwaNdebele, Mpumalanga, selling mopane worms and chillies to supplement her family’s income.She was raised by two grandmothers, one a domestic worker who earned R100 a month in the 1980s, and a second who sold peanuts and soup. She was the first person in her family to go to university. She is now CE of personal and business banking at Standard Bank.Baloyi is the brains behind Discovery Insure, the short-term insurance division of Discovery Holdings. He founded it and became its executive director at the age of 34. Baloyi grew up in a poor community in Newcastle, KwaZulu-Natal that had no running water. His grandmother had inspired a culture of entrepreneurship, education and hard work. To put bread on the table, she had him and his cousins push a wheelbarrow and dig for coal on land owned by the chief. She then sold the coal for a profit.One may say these are exceptions. But the point is that Montjane and Baloyi’s parents or guardians took a keen interest in their education from a young age. If all parents took a keen interest in their children’s school affairs and the black middle class contributed back to its old schools, the Montjanes, Baloyis and Madis would not be exceptions.The black middle class would be saving money to take their children to Harvard or Oxford rather than an expensive local school.
The 79-year-old is to address the 54-member nations of UEFA at their annual Congress knowing most of the delegates are backing the other three candidates: Jordanian Prince Ali Bin Al Hussein, Dutchman Michael van Praag and Luis Figo of Portugal.Blatter will make a speech at the start of Congress in his role as FIFA chief but has rejected an offer to address delegates as a presidential hopeful.He said he had no need to campaign as his 40-year record at soccer's governing body spoke for itself.Blatter may be right because, despite his organisation facing one crisis or another, he is the overwhelming favourite to win a fifth term of office in the election at the FIFA Congress in Zurich on May 29.But he will be under no illusions when he faces his fellow Europeans on Tuesday that not all of them believe he is fit to carry on as president."It will be very bad indeed if he continues," Van Praag told reporters on Monday. "I believe that if the present president of FIFA goes on we will keep on having these things again and again and again."I'm of the opinion Mr Blatter is responsible for this and he will never be accepted by anyone in the world as the person to turn FIFA around," added the 67-year-old chairman of the Dutch FA.Although attention is to focus on Blatter at the start of Congress, UEFA will also be re-electing Michel Platini as president for a third term.The former France international was once an ally of the FIFA leader but the pair have drifted apart and Platini is now endorsing Blatter's opponents.Among other elections on Tuesday is one for three UEFA representatives on FIFA's executive committee that will almost certainly see two critics of Blatter voted on to the most powerful group in world football.German FA chairman Wolfgang Niersbach will be elected unopposed while England's David Gill is expected to win a seat reserved for the British vice-presidency in a two-way battle against Trefor Lloyd Hughes of Wales.Incumbent Angel Maria Villar Llona of Spain will also be re-elected unopposed.
E-commerce giant Amazon has announced a new, portable version of its streaming box that is the size of a USB stick and plugs directly into a TV's HDMI port.Similar to the Google Chromecast - which also plugs into a TV and is used to stream content from a mobile device to a larger screen - the Fire TV Stick contains the Fire TV interface that is found in the firm's already on-sale streaming box, including apps for Netflix, BBC iPlayer and Sky News.Streaming television shows and movies is becoming increasingly popular, with recent data from YouGov showing one in three UK adults downloads or streams content every week.Amazon says that since it launched its original streaming hardware, the Fire TV, it has become the most popular item in its category on Amazon.co.uk. The software included also contains access to games and Amazon's subscription-based TV and movie streaming service.The US-based firm's founder and chief Jeff Bezos said: "When we launched Fire TV in the UK last September, it quickly became our fastest-selling Amazon device."We're excited to introduce Fire TV Stick in the UK. Fire TV Stick is the most powerful streaming media stick available, with a dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM, 8GB of storage, dual-band and dual-antenna wifi, included remote control, voice search with our free mobile app and an open ecosystem."The team has packed a huge amount of power and selection into an incredible price point - Fire TV Stick is just £35."In an early marketing push for the device, which Amazon confirmed will go on-sale on April 15, for the next two days customers who are also members of the firm's premium delivery and streaming service, Prime, can order the Fire TV Stick for £19.Those who are not Prime members but wish to sign-up for the service can buy the Stick for £7. While Amazon Prime is free for the first 30 days, the service then costs £79 a year.Amazon ran a similar deal in the US when the Fire TV Stick launched there at the end of 2014. In comparison, Google's Chromecast costs £30, while another rival stick from Roku costs £45.Amazon has been making large strides outwards from its traditional online retail and e-commerce business in recent years; first launching the Kindle e-reader before moving into tablets and then the first smartphone last year. However, the Fire Phone received mixed reviews.A move into using drones to deliver products has also come a step closer, as last week the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) awarded Amazon a certificate to test the remotely piloted vehicles.
NHS hospitals have paid doctors and nurses record sums amid a spiralling crisis in Accident & Emergency departments, new figures show.Locum medics were able to charge up to £3,200 each per shift, with agency nurses on unprecedented rates of up to almost £1,900 a day, as casualty units struggled to cope this winter, an investigation has found.The figures show that as hospitals suffered the worst A&E performance on record over Christmas and New Year, several NHS trusts became almost entirely dependent on agency staff.At one trust, almost three quarters of doctors’ shifts were filled by temporary workers, the investigation by Sky News found.Health officials are fearful that the problems could recurr over Easter, when many NHS services will close for a four-day bank holiday, heaping pressures on casualty units.GPs have been asked to work extra shifts on Holy Saturday, and hospitals have been ordered to discharge as many healthy patients as possible, to cope with surges in demand.Senior medics said hospitals are being forced to pay “super premium” rates, much of which went to agencies, amid “desperate” shortages of staff in A&E departments.Experts said some agencies were able to collect fees of up to £100 an hour before paying doctors and nurses.The figures, revealed under Freedom of Information laws, show record sums paid out for individual shifts.United Lincolnshire NHS trust paid £3,257 for one doctor to work a shift of 12 hours, and remain on call to work for 12 hours, between Christmas and New Year.Over the same period, Royal Berkshire NHS Foundation trust paid £1,875 for a nurse to work 12 hours - the equivalent of £156 an hour.The daily fees for a nurse is believed to be the highest ever paid by the NHS.Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and North Bristol NHS trust each paid nurses rates of more than £1,700 per shift.The fees for doctors are believed to be the highest for at least five years, since Stafford Hospital paid inflated rates to plug a staffing crisis in the wake of the scandal over poor care.NHS trusts defended the payments, saying they sums had become “the market rate” amid shortages of staff.Royal Cornwall Hospitals NHS Trust paid £2142 for an A&E doctor to work 10 hours, while Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust paid £2099 for one medic to work a shift of nine hours, the figures show.At Airedale NHS Foundation Trust 71 per cent of the shifts between Christmas and New Year were covered by a locum doctor. Heart of England NHS Foundation trust and Royal Bolton Hospital trust each filled more than half of their medical shifts with locums.Many trusts were heavily reliant on agency nurses. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust had to find agency nurses for 43 per cent of shifts between Christmas and New Year, King’s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust used them for 32 per cent of shifts and Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust for 25 per cent.Dr Cliff Mann, President of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: “Market forces really are quite extreme currently, with the lack of permanent people to employ.“It means hospitals are desperate to try to find people to fill these slots and are having to pay super premium rates for that to happen.”The figures were obtained by following a Freedom of Information request. 75 out of 140 NHS trusts replied to questions about how their emergency departments were staffed between December 24 2014 and January 1st.
THE message was simple - Get Esmé to Chile.And a few hundred music lovers certainly helped her half way across the Atlantic.Esmé Pringle has been selected by Project Trust to work as an assistant English teacher in Chile for 12 months.The 17-year-old will be based across schools in socially deprived areas of the capital Santiago, with the aim of providing a high level of education.Esmé, from Innerleithen, has undergone an intensive selection process at the charity’s base on the Isle of Coll.But she must raise £5,000 by the end of August to be allowed to fulfill her year’s charity work.At the Mac Arts Centre in Galashiels she raised almost half of her total.As well as three bands - Umbel, Curdled Milk and the Border Boogie Band - the crowd also took part in Blind Llama Darts - throwing darts at a map of South America whilst wearing a llama head, with the nearest Santiago winning - and a prize-draw raffle.Following Friday’s fundraiser Esmé told us: “I didn’t realise just how much work was involved in putting on a night like this and everyone’s been absolutely amazing.“It’s really starting to sink in now that I’m actually going to Chile.”It was very much a family affair with dad, Grant Pringle, not only MC-ing the evening but also performing with Esmé’s brother, Isaac, in Umbel.Esmé also took to the stage with her own band, Curdled Milk, before headliners, the Border Boogie Band, delivered their usual blistering set.Esmé added: “It was a brilliant night. Umbel were cool, despite the fact my dad and brother were playing!Dozens of shops and companies have heleped the Peebles High Dux Girl in her fundraising quest.And dad, Grant, was full of praise for all of them.He told us: “I’ve been overwhelmed by the support we’ve received for Esmé.“It’s been a fantastic night and I’m so grateful to everyone at Mac Arts for their hard work behind the scenes.“I can’t thank everyone enough for coming along, spending money at the bar and boogying to the bands. The bar was dry by the end of the night which explains some of the shapes being thrown on the dance floor later on!”Esmé still has more than £1000 to raise before August and it expected that a ceilidh will be staged in June.Donations can be made to justgiving.com/esmepringle
Asian markets experience mixed fortunes after surveys indicated weaker manufacturing growth in China and Japan.The region's two largest economies saw factory activity expand at a slower pace in March, suggesting that their recoveries may be losing momentum.Hong Kong's Hang Seng index ended down 0.4% at 24,399.6, while Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 0.1% lower at 19,734.05.The Shanghai Composite reversed earlier losses to close up 0.1% at 3,691.41.That marks the 10th consecutive daily gain for the mainland benchmark.Australian shares also closed higher, with the S&P/ASX 200 rising 0.2% to 5,969.08, thanks to a rally in gold mining stocks.South Korean shares followed that trend with the Kospi index ending up 0.2% at 2,041.37 - its highest finish in six months.China's factory activity fell to an 11-month low in March after new orders decreased, a survey indicated.The flash HSBC/Markit Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) fell to 49.2 in March, down from February's figure of 50.7. A figure below 50 indicates contraction in the sector.Julian Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said the PMI reading was "the latest in a string of disappointing data out of China"."Looking ahead, we expect the deceleration in growth to moderate in coming months as policymakers step up fiscal spending and carry out further cuts to the required reserve ratio and benchmark interest rates in order to prevent growth this year from slipping too far below their annual target," he said in a report.Japan's manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index by Markit fell to 50.4 on a seasonally-adjusted basis from February's figure of 51.6.
The Bank of Scotland’s latest business monitor found that the economy slowed in the three months to the end of February but is anticipated to grow close to pre-recession levels over the next six months.It reported that in the three months ending in February, 33 per cent of the 408 firms surveyed saw an increase in turnover, 34 per cent experienced static turnover and 33 per cent experienced a decrease.This gave a net balance of 0 per cent, down from the +16 per cent of the previous quarter and the +18 per cent of the same quarter a year ago.The net balance is calculated by subtracting those that report a decrease from those that report an increase.It was the worst result for turnover in 21 months, suggesting the Scottish economy experienced a sharp jolt to growth at the start of this year, the business monitor said.Turnover for firms in the production sector was down significantly while the services sector also showed a sharp slowdown.Firms also reported a fall in volumes of repeat business and new business while export activity increased slightly.Businesses remain optimistic for the next six months, with 34 per cent expecting to see turnover increase, compared with 20 per cent who expect a decrease. A further 46 per cent expect it to remain static.Bank of Scotland chief economist Donald MacRae said: “The Scottish economy slowed at the start of 2015 but is expected to return to moderate growth in spring.“Expectations have fallen slightly but remain close to pre-recession levels, suggesting that growth will pick up in the second quarter of the year.”
A HOUSE in Bradford has been badly damaged after clothes and bedding left on a gas fire set a first-floor bedroom ablaze.Firefighters from Fairweather Green were called to the incident in Fearnesides Street, Manningham, around 9.45pm last night.Crew commander Steven O'Keefe said the occupants of the house had gone out, but had left a pile of bedding and clothes too close to the fire.The blaze was well-developed by the time the crew arrived, as the house, and its neighbouring properties, did not have any smoke detectors."The crew did a great job in getting in so early to limit the fire, but there is still a lot of smoke and water damage," said Mr O'Keefe."It is vital that people check everything is safe before they leave the house, and they need to ensure they have working smoke alarms."We will be in the area over the next few days to fit smoke alarms where they are needed."No-one was injured in the incident.

NRL teams may carry replacement players on their reserves benches next season for the first time since 1990, while the number of interchanges could be reduced to as few as six.The NRL has instigated a comprehensive review of the interchange rules in a move aimed at making the game safer and more exciting. A recommendation will be put to the ARL Commission by the middle of the season to enable clubs time to restructure their rosters and NRL head of football Todd Greenberg confirmed the review would consider both the number of interchanges and the composition of the bench."We won't do this piece of work in isolation to the composition of the bench," Greenberg said. "People need to understand that composition of the bench may be made up of both interchange players and substitute players."That hasn't been in the game for a long time and we will do that in consultation with our medical staff and the chief medical officers of the clubs to ensure that there is that balance between the interchange and also to make sure when players are injured and can no longer participate that the clubs aren't disadvantaged." Replacements were allowed on the bench from 1970 until 1990, with the number varying between two who had played in a lower-grade game to four, who initially comprised of two fresh players and two who had played at least half a game before  becoming all fresh reserves.The interchange rule was introduced in 1991 and has shifted between six and 12 interchanges, andbeing unlimited at times.Greenberg agreed the changes could be the most significant to the game since the number of interchanges was altered from unlimited to 12 in 2001 before being capped at 10 in 2008."It is a big decision for the game, it will have a big impact on the game but equally I think it will have great positives for the game as long as we do the work behind the scenes," he said. "These are changes we are looking at for the future of the game."Dr Kevin Norton, a professor of exercise science at the University of South Australia, has been commissioned to head the review and Greenberg said the NRL was working in consultation with England's Rugby Football League and the NSWRL, QRL and Country Rugby League."The game has made a statement today which talks of a strong intent to look at the future of interchange and the composition of the bench, and to do that we will require a significant and detailed piece of work, and it is important that people understand that is consultation with a range of key groups, including our counterparts in the UK," he said.
Depraved Scott Wood, 47, subjected his victim to a series of harrowing sex assaults in the mid-80s.In his late teens Wood, who until recently worked at Nissan’s Sunderland plant, tempted the youngster with cigarettes and sweets before sexually assaulting him on a number of occasions.As Wood was jailed for eight years and forced to sign the sex offenders’ register for life, his victim’s mum told the Echo: “My son has lived with what happened for 30 years and it still affects him to this day.“It’s like a life sentence for all of us.”The victim was a schoolboy when he was abused by Wood.He was unable to tell his family what had gone on after Wood had warned him it would get the boy into trouble.The abuse stopped suddenly, but it was only a number of years later, as a man, that the victim felt able to let his family know of the horrendous ordeal he had been put through.His mother said: “My son came to me one day and told me he had been sexually abused as a child.“When he said it was Scott Wood I didn’t know what to say.“He said he used to give him money, sweets and cigarettes and then abused him when they were alone together. He groomed him.“Then I think he put the fear of God into my son so that he wouldn’t talk about it to anyone.”In 2013, the victim contacted Northumbria Police and gave a statement, leading to Wood’s arrests and charge by the Crown Prosecution Service.The victim and members of his family took to the witness box to give evidence at the hearing.“Harrowing isn’t the word for what that was like,” said the victim’s mum.“We’re a law-abiding family and to have to appear in court like that was such a shock to the system.“But we got through it together and when the verdict came we were over the moon.”Despite pleading not guilty to all charges, a jury at Newcastle Crown Court convicted Wood, of Poplar Street, Chester-le-Street, of four sex offences against a child under 16 after a two-day trial.He will now spend the next eight years behind bars and will remain on the sex offenders’ register for life.“My son was preyed on by Wood and it’s been 30 years that he’s had to live with it,” added the woman.“But he feels proud of what he has done in speaking out about things and it’s such a relief for him and all of us.”The family also said that if there are any other victims of Wood’s deplorable acts, they should come forward and notify police.“I can’t praise Steve Smith and the other staff at Northumbria Police enough,” said the victim’s mum.“They were brilliant with us and if there are any other victims then I hope they do come forward.“The help and support from the police we’ve had is amazing.”A spokesman for Nissan confirmed to the Echo that Wood is no longer employed by the company and the offences against the boy took place before he worked there.
A BLACK Country charity is looking for volunteers to help out at its various fundraising events throughout the year.Compton Hospice is currently recruiting for volunteers for its Compton in the Park, The Big Compton Campout, Halloween Scarefest and The Compton Christmas Market and Grotto events.Event volunteer duties can include anything from running admin desks, stalls and gates, to set up and clear down of events, event catering, promoting the hospice and generally assisting the fundraising team.Vicki Wootton, hospice fundraiser, said: “To run a successful fundraising event we rely heavily on the support of volunteers to help lend a hand.“Volunteers can help out just for a couple of hours at one event, or get involved in as many as they like- we also provide applicants with full orientation, support and recognition.”For more information, or to apply to be a volunteer, call Vicki Wootton on 01902 774532.
Tunisia’s ambassador to South Africa, Mohamed Ayari, lamented last week that “they hit us where it hurts most – tourism – almost the backbone of the economy”.He was sure the terrorists who had attacked the Bardo Museum on Thursday, killing 23 people, 20 of them foreign tourists, had timed the attack to coincide with the eve of the tourist season which begins in May. And he noted that they had succeeded in part, because one cruise ship operator had cancelled future stops in Tunis.A day later, Ayari was more hopeful because his government had announced that, apart from one Polish tour group, there had been no further cancellations.And, he was also pleased by the large demonstration in sympathy with the victims which took place in Tunis a day after the attacks.Ayari made the point that the attackers seemed to be aiming at undermining Tunisia, precisely because it is the only success story of the Arab Spring, which started there more than four years ago.Tunisians toppled the corrupt dictator Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali, as the Egyptians were to topple Hosni Mubarak and the Libyans Muammar Gaddafi, among others.But whereas the other revolutions were bloody and the outcomes chaotic, as in Libya, or entirely uncertain, as in Syria, or were reversed, as in Egypt, Tunisia’s Jasmine Revolution was largely peaceful and achieved democracy and stability. It seems to have reconciled the competing demands of liberalism and Islamism which have torn other Arab countries apart.That accommodation is not without its tensions and problems though, and there can never be an absolute guarantee of ultimate success, But so far, so good. Yet, in the view of the Tunisian government, it is this very success which appears to have provoked whoever was behind Thursday’s machine gun attack on Bardo Museum – perhaps Islamic State (IS), perhaps al-Qaeda or Ansar el Sharia or some combination.Because it belies their narrative that the only way of getting rid of corrupt and oppressive governments is by violence. That narrative took a knock when the Arab Spring began.Then the failure of the popular uprisings everywhere else heartened the jihadists. Now only Tunisia continues to defy their logic and so mayhem must be sewn to ensure the prophecy fulfils itself.Or so that argument goes. One wonders, though. The large numbers, perhaps majorities of those who participated in popular uprisings in Tunisia and elsewhere, did not share the ultimate objectives of the jihadists. For most of the peaceful revolutionaries, the aim was to replace corrupt and oppressive dictators with freedom and good, honest governance. Not another form of oppression in the form of sharia authoritarianism.At the start of the Arab Spring, there were alliances of convenience, perhaps naïve beliefs in compromises and a common objective.By now, though, four years later, the democrats have surely become wary of revolutionary alliances with the jihadists. As they have seen in Syria, with the rise of the barbaric IS, erstwhile allies can be worse than common enemies.That might explain why, according to Western intelligence sources, Tunisia has become the single largest source of IS foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, reports Africa Confidential. And the Guardian has written that most of those Tunisian IS volunteers come from middle class rather than working class or poor families.These are people who are evidently not persuaded by the success of the Jasmine Revolution, presumably because its outcome, democracy and a better material life, is not what they ever had in mind anyway.What they had in mind was sharia, an Islamist state, a caliphate. The very success of the transition may have given them the greater freedom to pursue that goal.Jihadism, this all suggests, should be treated as an ideology, not a sociological phenomenon, not a reaction to or a method for eradicating oppression and corruption but an end in itself,to be fought not so much politically and economically but ultimately, militarily.
Two ruthless robbers who held a terrified student at knifepoint for 20 minutes and frogmarched him to a cash point have been locked up for a total of 12 years.The victim was watching a video on his mobile phone as he walked from a friend’s house along Merridale Road, Wolverhampton, when the pair struck at 8.50pm.He was wearing earphones but felt a tap on the shoulder and when he turned around he found to find he was face to face with James Oakes, who pulled out a kitchen knife and warned: “Give me everything or I will stab you – I am not messing about.”Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the student handed over his mobile, wallet and earphones out of his pockets during the confrontation on July 22 last year.Mr Justin Jarmola, prosecuting, said Oakes, aged 39 and with 18 previous convictions involving 50 separate offences, took a bank card out of the wallet and alerted Shaun Watson, who was standing nearby while the initial attack occurred on the student.The two men then marched the victim at knifepoint to the cash point in nearby Chapel Ash where they kept watch as he withdrew £150 from his account under instructions and gave them the money.He was then ordered to walk the short distance to Lord Street, where his wallet and bank card were returned and he was warned not to tell anybody.“He had been held for around about 20 minutes,” said Mr Jarmola.Watson, aged 26 and with 10 previous convictions for 20 offences, was on bail after being convicted of another robbery in which a young man had a mobile phone stolen at knifepoint outside a Tesco store in Madeley, Shropshire, on August 17, 2013.Mr Danny Smith, for Oakes, of no fixed address, said: “He was not thinking straight because drugs were clouding his mind.”Miss Hannah Wood, representing Watson, from Glebelands, Donnington, Telford, added: “He was not aware of the robbery or the fact his co-accused had a knife until the man called him over.“He then provided support as the victim was marched to the cash point.”Oakes, who admitted robbery and possession of a knife, was jailed for four years by Judge Stephen Eyre, QC.Watson received a total prison sentence of eight years for the Wolverhampton robbery, which he admitted, and the Shropshire robbery, which had been denied.
UEFA president Michel Platini on Tuesday warned of an "insidious" rise of extremism in Europe which he said had brought a new risk of troubles in football stadiums.Platini, who is to be reelected unopposed to a third term leading Europe's governing body, said governments had to stop a return to football's dark days when "hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots" in many European stadiums.The former football star highlighted the 30th anniversary of the 1985 Heysel stadium disaster in Brussels, one of the darkest days of football history, when he was playing for Juventus against Liverpool."Europe is seeing a rise in nationalism and extremism the like of which we have not witnessed for a very long time," Platini told UEFA's annual congress in Vienna."This insidious trend can also be observed in our stadiums, as football is a reflection of society. Given its popularity, our sport is a barometer for the ills of our continent. And that barometer is pointing to some worrying developments."Crowd troubles and racist abuse have mounted in stadiums across Europe in the past two years. Police clashed with fans in Rotterdam and Kiev in European competitions in recent weeks."In these battles that we are fighting, we feel as if we have been left to fend for ourselves somewhat. And yet, these are battles that can only be won with the help of the public authorities," Platini added.The UEFA president said that governments had to take action "so that we can avoid reliving the dark days of a not-so-distant past ? a past where hooligans and all manner of fanatics called the shots in certain European stadiums."In recent months, we have all been struck by certain images that I thought were a thing of the past. Some of us experienced that past at first hand. In my case, it was exactly 30 years ago."Platini was a key player for Juventus in the Heysel stadium where 39 mainly Juventus fans were crushed to death following troubles in the stadium.Platini called for tougher and European wide bans on known troublemakers in stadiums."We need tougher stadium bans at European level and ? I will say it again ? the creation of a European sports police force," he said.
Sorry, we're having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canThe smash happened on the A183 Chester Road, near to the junction with Hylton Road, just after 9am.Northumbria Police say the silver Nissan Mirca overturned, with the 18-year-old driver of the car helped free by the emergency services.He suffered minor injuries in the incident, which left nearby railings damaged.Efforts are now being made to recover the car.
An organisation representing emergency care doctors is calling for four steps to be taken to address the challenges facing emergency departments.The Royal College of Emergency Medicine (RCEM) in Scotland is calling for better funding and staffing.It comes on the day the latest weekly A&E waiting time figures were published showing a slight improvement.Health Secretary Shona Robison described the measures as "in line with the work we are already doing".The four-point plan is part of Royal College's Step campaign.•Safe and sustainable staffing levels must be achieved•Terms, working conditions and funding must be fair and effective•Exit block and overcrowding must be tackled•Primary care facilities must be co-located with Emergency Department servicesDr Martin McKechnie, vice president (Scotland) of RCEM, said: "This campaign is essential for providing immediate support to, as well as ensuring the future of, Scotland's emergency departments."The college welcomes the support the Scottish government has given to increasing staffing and tackling crowding in our emergency departments."We now need real action to be taken to champion our talented emergency medicine workforce, otherwise we will continue to lose staff to emigration and to other specialties."The latest weekly waiting time figures for Scottish emergency departments suggested 92% of people were treated within four hours, an increase from 90% last week.However, the figure is still short of the Scottish government's target for 95% of people to be treated and discharged within four hours.In January, the Scottish government announced £100m to help health boards and local authorities tackle bed blocking to help people move out of A&E and through the system.Last month, Ms Robison said this winter had seen "unprecedented pressures" in hospitals.Scottish Green MSP Alison Johnstone said: "Our health service is under enormous pressure and I urge the Scottish government to listen carefully to what A&E staff are saying."I have previously raised with ministers the problem of delayed discharge, and this must be a key area for investment to free up capacity in emergency departments."In response to the Royal College's call, Ms Robison said: "I welcome the Royal College of Emergency Medicine acknowledgement of the support the Scottish government has given to increasing staffing and tackling crowding in our accident and emergency departments."The four points suggested by the college are relevant and in line with the work we are already doing to improve A&E performance as it faces challenges like increased demand and an ageing population."For example, we have continued to drive increased recruitment. Since September 2006 the number of emergency medicine consultants has risen from 75.8 whole time equivalent staff to 205 - an increase of 170.6% and we are committed to working with the RCEM on this issue."The new emergency department workload tool, which will be rolled out later this year across Scotland, is being designed with doctors and nurses to help ensure that hospitals continue to have in place appropriate staffing to meet the variable workload demands."Fixing the exit block from the emergency department and how a patient moves back into the community is also a priority. We have committed £100m specifically to help tackle delayed discharged and are piloting innovative, world-leading ideas on patient flow."
Scrap metal dealers are being asked to help police catch two men who stole the ceremonial chains of the mayor and mayoress of Bury, Greater Manchester.A robber hit the mayor's driver with a hammer as he loaded a briefcase containing the chains into the mayoral car in Radcliffe on 30 October.He then jumped into a waiting green Volkswagen Polo in the town's Stand Lane area, which then drove off.Police fear the chains, worth about £200,000, may be sold or melted down.The mayor's driver suffered a fractured shoulder blade during the theft. No arrests have been made since the incident.The mayor, Councillor Michelle Wiseman, and her daughter Danielle, who is serving as mayoress, had been attending a service of remembrance on the day of the theft.The mayor's chain was given by Queen Victoria in 1877 with the mayoress's chain a gift to mark the monarch's Diamond Jubilee 20 years later.Det Con Martin Brown said: "It has been four months since these chains, which are of enormous historical and monetary value, were stolen during a violent robbery."Although the scrap metal is dwarfed by the historical significance and heritage of these chains, the culprits will only profit from this theft by selling the chains on the black market or by melting them down."I would appeal to metal dealers, not just in Bury but throughout Manchester, to be vigilant and if you come into contact with anyone offering you these chains then please do the right thing and call us."

Six IRA fugitives connected to two of the most notorious atrocities of the Northern Ireland Troubles were among those given “get-out-of-jail cards” under a controversial scheme that MPs have described as possibly unlawful.The six IRA “on the runs” are suspects in the 1983 Harrods bomb that killed six people outside the London department store and the Enniskillen massacre four years later in which 11 people died, the Guardian has learned.Security sources in Northern Ireland say one of the six, who is wanted for questioning over the 1987 Poppy Day explosion in the County Fermanagh town, is at present living in England.The six were among almost 100 IRA activists who were given “letters of assurance” from Tony Blair’s government as part of moves to secure Sinn Féin’s support for policing and justice reforms under devolution.In a report published on Tuesday, the Northern Ireland affairs select committee said it was questionable whether the scheme was lawful and concluded it had distorted the legal processThe republican party had petitioned the then Labour government to introduce the scheme in order that 95 republicans wanted for almost 300 crimes including murder would no longer fear arrest and conviction if they returned to Northern Ireland or Britain.Sinn Féin argued that the 95 were strong backers of the peace process and their removal from police wanted lists would bolster support for new policing and justice arrangements within the wider republican community.The committee’s report into the scheme criticised a number of figures and institutions including the Northern Ireland Office (NIO), the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Tony Blair’s government for the way it was run and their roles in relation to it.The report stated: “It is questionable whether the “on-the-runs” (OTR) scheme was lawful or not, but we believe its existence distorted the legal process. We accept that there was a difficult peace process going on at the time, but believe that there still has to be transparency and accountability in government and in the legal process.”It accused both the then government and the NIO of cloaking the scheme in secrecy and discriminating against the rest of Northern Irish society just to placate one party – Sinn Féin.It also severely criticised the current Northern Ireland secretary, Theresa Villiers, over her refusal during hearings to the committee to disclose the names of individuals on the scheme who were specifically granted the royal prerogative of mercy. The committee described the secretary of state’s decision not to reveal these names as wholly unacceptable.The parliamentary committee, which includes a number of unionist and nationalist MPs from Northern Ireland, said the scheme should never have been run the way it was designed.In the report, the MPs recommend that future governments ensure “that all necessary steps are taken, including, if necessary, introducing legislation to ensure the letters have no legal effect”.Sir Laurence Robertson QC, the chairman of the committee, said the victims of IRA violence had been let down by the way the government operated the OTR scheme.“If any scheme had been put in place at all, which is questionable, it should have been properly introduced and correctly administered. It also should have been open and transparent. This scheme was none of those things.“Regardless of the intentions, this scheme has caused further hurt to people who have suffered far too much already, and has led to further suspicions being raised.”The six IRA OTRs currently being investigated are linked to the Harrods and Enniskillen bombs. One security source in Northern Ireland told the Guardian: “These are the two major incidents under investigation in which these individuals are connected to and wanted for questioning. These are new cases and will fully test the legality of the OTR scheme.”He added that the investigation “might be complicated” by one Enniskillen bomb suspect. The former IRA activist from Northern Ireland disappeared from the province several years ago amid claims that he was about to be exposed as a long-term British agent. He is understood to be living on a state witness protection programme under a new identity in England.One of the 95 IRA OTRs, John Downey, was arrested and charged in 2013 with the London Hyde Park bombings in which four British soldiers were killed. However, the case against the convicted IRA man from County Donegal collapsed after his legal team produced one of the letters of assurance in the Old Bailey revealing the existence of the “comfort letters”.Commenting on the Downey trial, the report criticised the judge and the prosecution for seeking out witness statements on the nature of the OTR scheme from other parties in the case.During hearings to the committee earlier this year, Tony Blair told the MPs that “the issue of OTRs was absolutely critical to the peace process and at certain points became fundamental to it ... I think it is likely that the process would have collapsed.”The state’s pursuit of the six IRA OTRs over the Harrods and Enniskillen massacres will again raise fears of destabilisation within the wider republican community.Hardline dissident republicans will accuse Sinn Féin of no longer being able to defend the IRA’s “most wanted” activists from future arrests and prosecutions.
Poking fun at fat people should be treated as seriously as racism and sexism, researchers have said.Obesity expert Dr Sarah Jackson said that the law should protect against weight discrimination, in the same way at it prohibits singling out people based on their age, gender or race.Dr Jackson, of University College London, spoke out after conducting two studies into the physical and psychological effects of fattism.Her latest study, of more than 5,000 British adults found that those who were made to feel ashamed of their size suffered more symptoms of depression.They also had a lower quality of life than those who didn’t feel victimised.Examples of fattism included being treated disrespectfully, including being the butt of jokes, receiving poorer services in shops, restaurants, hospitals and doctors’ surgeries, being threatened and being assumed to be stupid.She previously showed shaming fat people into losing weight is counterproductive.Far from shocking people into slimming, it actually leads to them piling on the pounds.It is thought fattism drives those who are already sensitive about their weight to comfort eat. Fear of ridicule may also mean they avoid exercise.With two-thirds of British women overweight or obese, jibes, taunts and simple thoughtlessness could be having a huge effect on the nation’s mental and psychological health.Dr Sarah Jackson, the lead author of both studies, said that people may believe that weight discrimination is socially acceptable because unlike ageism, sexism and racism, it is not covered by law.She said: ‘In the United Kingdom, the Equality Act 2010 legally protects individuals from discrimination on the basis of age, sex, race, disability, religion or beliefs, sexual orientation, marital status, pregnancy, or gender reassignment; making it clear that discriminatory behaviour of this nature is not to be accepted.‘However, our results indicate that discriminatory experiences contribute to poorer psychological wellbeing in individuals with obesity, but there are currently no laws prohibiting weight discrimination.‘This might send the message to people that weight discrimination is socially acceptable.‘If weight was a protected category it might help to reduce the prevalence of weight-related discrimination and thereby improve quality of life and wellbeing for a significant proportion of obese individuals.’Researcher Professor Jane Wardle said: ‘Combined with our previous work showing that weight discrimination does not encourage weight loss, we can see that weight discrimination is part of the obesity problem and not the solution.‘Weight bias has been documented not only among the general public but also among health professionals; and many obese patients report being treated disrespectfully by doctors because of their weight.‘Everyone, including doctors, should stop blaming and shaming people for their weight, and offer support, and where appropriate, treatment.’
Forget sex, drugs & rock'n'roll. It seems entrepreneurship has never been cooler among today's young people.Perhaps its today's technology? Maybe its the influence of business in popular culture (hello Alan Sugar!) or maybe its a mindset thing with today's young people living through a recession.And now brands are starting to turn this passion into action. Heritage American tennis brand K Swiss is partnering with DJ producer and businessman Diplo to launch 'The Board', a campaign built to inspire, and to be led by, the next generation of young entrepreneurs.Appointing Diplo is a nod to the K Swiss founders, two entrepreneurs who moved to California in 1966 and built the global brand from a revolutionary tennis shoe, the K Swiss Classic. Diplo will serve as the Director of a 100-person board comprised of creative and connected individuals who will work on real tasks to bring the K Swiss brand back to prominence.And the application site is now open until the end of April."We believe that consumer aspirations have shifted. The goal has evolved beyond being the fastest runner or being a celebrity. Young people want their own brands, their own voice and their own businesses. K Swiss is committed to outfitting and inspiring this generation of entrepreneurs. We have created a program with substance, where our customers get involved in the process of rebuilding K•Swiss and make real contributions. As a respected entrepreneur and global music talent, Diplo is the perfect leader for 'The Board'," said Barney Waters, chief marketing officer of K Swiss Global Brands.Led by Diplo, successful applicants to 'The Board' will be invited to the program's members-only website with a six-course curriculum connecting the group with industry insiders.Each insider will lead a discussion session specific to their expertise, and then assign a task to the board that relates to K Swiss' business. Members of 'The Board' will make real decisions on real projects that K Swiss will follow. The program will highlight important topics, including: brand positioning, sneaker design, social media promotion and drafting a business plan."I was instantly drawn to the K-Swiss brand due to their heritage and longevity in the marketplace," said Diplo. "I am excited to be part of 'The Board', to bring young entrepreneurial minds into the process to help build the next chapter at such a respected brand," said Diplo.Of course, it wouldn't be an entrepreneurship programme in 2015 without a social media platform too. You can follow the campaign through the hashtags #ourkswiss and #theboard.Would be great to see health, arts and the public sector take this open approach to ideas too. Business brains, go forth!
Ed Sheeran is giving acting a go, and he’s kicking it off on the set of the legendary Home And Away.He was spotted strolling along Palm Beach with actress Emily Symons who plays the longstanding Marilyn.During his world tour, which has included a lengthy stop down-under, Ed took time out to appear on the famous Aussie soap for his soap acting debut.He told news.com.au it was all a bit of ‘fun’, but he has his eye on the Brit soaps now.‘It’s an Australian instituation. It’s always on in my local chip shop.‘I got asked to do it and it sounded like it could be fun. I did Shortland Street in New Zealand as well and I’m sure if Emmerdale or EastEnders ever ask me in England I would do that as well.’The scenes will air later this year.A spokesperson for the show said the scenes are being kept under wraps until they air (spoilsports) but that Ed would be playing himself.He later left the set by boat.He made his appearance earlier this week despite tweeting he was suffering from ‘man flu’.

London’s latest pop-up is a restaurant where EVERYTHING on the menu is deep fried. Happy Easter.The pop-up called FryHard (someone’s a Bruce Willis fan) will only open for the long Easter weekend (April 2-5) because, let’s face it, our arteries couldn’t take much longer.It will be based in Boxpark, Shoreditch, and will serve 100 different deep-fried delicacies.Items on the menu include deep fried Babybel, buttered crumpets, hot cross buns, cake, pork pies, and quiche Lorraine.And then there’s the centerpiece – the Fully Fried Easter. That would be a whole fried lamb joint, roast potatoes, carrots and sprouts. All deep fried. It serves six and has to be booked in advance.The ‘you can have anything as long as it’s battered’ concept was dreamt up by foodie renegades Messhead, a collaboration between chef Jim Thomlinson’s London Mess and freelance creative director Emma Thomas, aka Miss Cakehead.Although it sounds like a cruel April Fool’s joke, the duo insist it’s legit, albeit a little ridiculous.Miss Cakehead told MailOnline: ‘Jim is about to launch his street food concept Prawnography at Old Street Roundabout – part of Burger Bear HQ – so we want to do something really fun and ridiculous before the hard work begins.‘We also tried deep fried chocolate at Jim’s previous pop up The Dead Horse Society – once I tasted it for the first time I knew I had to revisit!’ she adds.Early reaction to the concept has, she says, been overwhelmingly positive, except for one dentist who said they were ‘disgusting’.She reveals: ‘So many people want to come and try the foods on offer with deep fried Babybel getting the strongest response so far.’Further info is available on the Messhead Facebook page, where you can also make menu suggestions.
FORTY-NINE children have been identified as being at risk of sexual exploitation in North Yorkshire, figures have shown.Freedom of Information (FOI) requests sent to every local authority in the North-East showed there are 384 known vulnerable youngsters under 16.Although local authorities provided figures for at risk children, the region’s police forces turned down a similar request.North Yorkshire and Northumbria refused to give details to The Press’s sister paper, the Northern Echo, on the grounds it would take them too long to compile the information.One mother, whose child was targeted by a sexual predator, said she feared this was just the “tip of the iceberg”.The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, also slammed the region’s four police forces for refusing to disclose their child exploitation figures, despite them all introducing computer markers from 2013 onwards to highlight grooming.She said: “I think 384 children is a lot, but that’s just the ones they are aware of, so it’s scary to think about what the actual number is.“I bet this is just the tip of the iceberg.”Now 16, her daughter was abused by Middlesbrough taxi driver Shakil Munir, one of three men convicted at Teesside Crown Court of grooming girls as young as 13 and exploiting them for sex.Last year, children’s charity Barnardo’s worked with 178 sexually exploited boys and girls children in the North-East, more than triple the number it helped in 2010, with some victims as young as 11.
Detectives said the incident on Blackstock Road, Gleadless Valley, on Friday night started when a man made a comment to a woman as she walked passed him, before punching her in the face.Her friend, a 23-year-old woman, followed the attacker into the Blackstock Pub, where she confronted him.She was then attacked by another man, and knocked unconscious, as she left the pub.That attacker then assaulted an 18-year-old man, who was also knocked unconscious, after he stepped in to try to assist the two women.PC Mary Glenwright said: “This was a nasty and violent attack and I would urge anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have been in the pub or the area at the time to please contact police.”Both attackers were white and around 5ft 7ins tall.One was around 45-years-old and was wearing a black bomber style jacket.The other was around 35, of a stocky build with a bald head and was wearing a dark polo shirt.Anyone with information should call South Yorkshire Police 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555111, quoting incident number 1,085 of March 20.
Today I would like to propose a new and emerging dietary syndrome – 'chronic carbohydrate deprivation', which sees fit and healthy individuals keeping their carbohydrate intake so tightly controlled that they fail to adequately fuel their bodies and remain 5-10 kilograms over their ideal weight.  Chronic carb deprivers rarely indulge; keep their carbs low by restricting bread, rice, pasta, fruit and snack food and struggle to understand why they cannot shift the last few kilograms even though they exercise far more than the average person. So, if this sounds remotely like you, and it is 11am and the only carbs that have crossed your lips for the past 16 hours is the milk in your coffee, read on.Carbohydrates are the primary fuel for the muscles and for the brain. When excessive carbohydrates are consumed, we are more likely to gain weight as extra calories consumed as fat are more likely to be stored. Highly processed carbohydrate rich foods including white bread, rice, snack food and simple sugars consumed via soft drinks, juices, desserts and confectionery also illicit a relatively high insulin response when they are consumed and high insulin levels over time can result in weight gain.The amount of carbohydrate we require on a daily basis will be influenced by how much activity we do. The greater the amounts of activity we do, the more fuel the muscles burn, and the more carbohydrate they will require to burn both carbohydrate and fat. This means that individuals who train regularly will require more carbohydrate than less active people, particularly if their goal is to burn (and lose) body fat.Enter chronic carbohydrate restrictors. While reducing carbohydrates in the diet will help to burn more fat initially as the body adjusts to a fuel shortage, over time muscles that are chronically deprived of the minimal amount of carbs that they need will increase the metabolic efficiency of their cells so they need fewer calories and carbohydrates to function.This means that while we eat fewer and fewer carbs, but continue with the same amount of exercise, we become less likely to burn body fat and lose weight. And this is the reason that individuals who train at hard, on most days of the week but eat minimal carbs do not get the changes with their body that they are looking for.So, if you only eat carb rich foods at breakfast; or train first thing in the morning without having consumed any carbs since lunchtime the previous day, it may be worth really considering how much carbohydrate your body may need as a minimum to optimally fuel you for training and fat burning.As a general rule of thumb, a small female will require at least 100 grams of total carbohydrate each day, along with an extra 20-30g total carbs for every hour of high intensity training. In simple terms, this means making sure at least three meals a day include a carbohydrate-rich food such as wholegrain bread, sweet potato, wholegrain crackers, legumes, fruit, milk or yoghurt.To gauge your own carbohydrate content, a quick scan of nutrition labels will give you examples of 20g serves of carbohydrates to add to your snacks or meals, and include foods such as a piece of fruit, ½ cup yoghurt, a few wholegrain crackers or a slice or two of lower carb bread.If you prefer to keep your carbohydrate intake lower at night by skipping all heavy carb foods such as pasta and rice, all you need to do is make sure you consume a small carb rich snack an hour or so before any morning training sessions – a slice of toast; piece of fruit, small milk coffee or couple of crackers to give the muscles some readily available fuel to burn. When it comes to carbs, it does not have to be all or nothing, while we do not need a lot of them we do need some, at the right times.

As well as believing his own side, currently third in the Championship, still have a strong chance of going up, Karanka reckons Bournemouth and Norwich City are also good tips for promotion."I thought a month ago that Derby would be [promoted] but they have a lot of injured players and they are losing games," said Karanka."Now Bournemouth with Norwich are the teams which have the better fixtures. Bournemouth are one of the biggest candidates (for promotion)."Bournemouth are the current Championship leaders after their 3-0 home win against Boro on Saturday, while Norwich are fourth, one place above the Rams.The Rams have been rocked by injuries to, among others, striker Chris Martin and midfielders George Thorne and John Eustace. Striker Darren Bent has also been sidelined, although he returned to the fray for the Rams in their 2-0 defeat at Wolves on Friday night.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter
TWO-and-a-half years after first opening its doors in Dorset, Westover Hyundai has a new look.The redeveloped showroom in Wallisdown Road is among just 14 of Hyundai’s 175 locations across the UK to have adopted the updated image to date.The showroom is now based over two floors and has its own entrance.Both the upstairs and downstairs areas feature big bright spaces, modern furnishings and the latest technology.Martin Hayward, brand manager for Westover Hyundai, said: “We are extremely proud of our new appearance – especially as we’re such an early adopter of the updated style – and have really enjoyed hearing positive feedback from our customers, who seem equally delighted with the changes we’ve made.“The new showroom majors on the extensive use of glass, ceramics and signage. The result is a warm and open space with a premium feel which neatly sums up the quality and professionalism of our service and is a proper reflection of the modern, vibrant Hyundai brand. The whole team feels really proud of the showroom and we’re definitely coming into work with a spring in our step.“I speak on behalf of everyone here when I thank all our customers for their patience during the redevelopment, as well as their continued support.”

NATIONAL NEWS - The owner of a business in Fourth Avenue, Geduld, shot an armed suspect after the business owner was robbed this morning.This comes after the three armed suspects robbed him and two of his workers at gun point.The victim says he was about to open the door of his business when three armed men pointed their guns at them and ordered them to sit on the floor.The suspects searched the victims and took three cellphones and a tablet.The business owner had his firearm with him, but luckily the suspects didn’t see it.“They demanded cash and took the petty cash kept on the premises,” he says.When the suspects ran away, he and his sister chased after them to Sixth Avenue, where he saw one of the robbers.According to the man he shouted at the suspect to “drop your gun or I will shoot”.After the suspect fired at the owner, he opened fire and wounded the robber.Springs police official, Amanda Greybe, says a bullet entered the suspect’s right side from behind.He was treated on the scene by paramedics and taken to the Far East Rand Hospital (FERH) for treatment.
A recent sojourn to Knock Castle Hotel and Spa in Crieff provided exactly those reactions.My wife and I were fortunate to spend a day and evening at the luxury residence and we were thrilled by the whole experience.As soon as you drive into the grounds the ‘ooo’ factor is there. The beautiful historic building that greets you is quite simply stunning and we immediately looked at each other and uttered ‘Wow!’As a few couples had arrived at a similar time, we had a quick look around and the ambient decor and furnishings are a joy to behold. We felt welcome and we hadn’t even spoken to anyone.The check in experience was simple and the reception staff treated us like old friends even though we had never met before.We booked dinner for that evening and were then shown to our room, a lovely suite.As we were enjoying a romantic weekend (the hotel was named Romantic Hotel of the Year 2014) with a couple of spa treatments thrown in, what greeted us was a delight.A bottle of Champagne was chilling alongside a sumptuous fruit platter and some home-made chocolates. A lovely touch!The main room of the suite featured a bath at the window and Mrs Stormont certainly enjoyed sipping her Champers while enjoying a long soak. I would love to comment on the chocolates, but Mrs S made short work of those.The main bathroom with shower was off the room, while the bedroom also had an en suite.Sufficiently refreshed after our journey, we headed along to the rooftop bar and restaurant to enjoy a drink before dinner.The views from the restaurant over the Perthshire hills are breathtaking and we really want to visit again in the summer so we can eat out on the terrace of the rooftop restaurant and enjoy the panorama.Whilst being completely unprepared for the joy of our stay to that point, the dining experience was overwhelming.I chose the Degustation Menu - seven course tasting menu which provides the opportunity to appreciate various foods - while Mrs S decided to choose from A’La Carte.My wife started with the Cauliflower and Smoked Cheese Souffle served with a Creamy Cheese Fondue.She then followed it with the Shallot and Blue Cheese Risotto topped with a Sakura Salad.To finish, it was a Dark Chocolate Fondant.Curious I tried some of her risotto because blue cheese is a strong flavour and I thought it may overwhelm the dish. It most certainly didn’t and she refused my overtures to swap!The other dishes, she tells me, were lip smackingly good.The menu provided for me had my tastebuds on fire – and that was before I had even started it. The anticipation of the delights was satisfied by food the like of which I have never tasted before.First of was the Mi Cuit of Duck Liver served with a Honey Roasted Fig, Brioche Bun and finished with Vanilla Dressing.Following were West Coast Hand Dived Scallops on a White Chocolate Risotto.The palate was cleansed be a delicious chef’s choice of sorbet. On this occasion lemon before Loin of Highland Venison with Rosemary Mash and Honey Roasted Carrots with a smoked Aubergine Puree was served.Whilst all the dishes were amazing, the venison for me was the star of the show.To conclude a delightful menu were a Dark Chocolate Fondant and then a Cheese Plate with Auld Alliance cheeses, celery, chutney and home-made oatcakes.After a hearty breakfast the following day we were treated to our spa treatments. I enjoyed a massage which was truly relaxing and I felt awesome afterwards, while my wife took the opportunity to have a professional manicure. I would certainly recommend the massage.Head chef and manager Jason Henderson’s philosophy is simple; visit Knock Castle, love your stay and enjoy the fine dining. Whatever else you want while you’re there all you need to do is ask and they will endeavour to make it happen.The hotel is perfect for a romantic getaway, ideal for a spa weekend with so many treatments available and, with over 10 golf courses in the vicinity, a weekend or longer on the fairways would appeal to many.A final note, every single staff member was polite, courteous, knowledgeable and chatty. Lovely people adding to a top class experience.They have a huge percentage of repeat business which is a sign that they are doing a lot right in my opinion. I will certainly go back.I cannot praise Knock Castle high enough. Visit it for yourself and enjoy the magic!Dinner, bed and breakfast in a standard room start from £149 per room per night. In a suite, dinner, bed and breakfast is from £319 per room per night.
A teenage boy strangled and raped a 48-year-old woman who thought she was going to die during a "terrifying ordeal" in woodland.The defendant, who was 16 at the time of the attack, has been handed a 15-year prison sentence after pleading guilty at Guildford Crown Court.His victim was attacked on a footpath in Bagshot at around 2pm on Friday June 27 last year, reports Get Surrey.The court heard the boy strangled the woman - who thought she was "going to die" - when she struggled.He falsely claimed that another person with a knife had been present and ordered him to rape a woman.The 17-year-old will be detained for six years of the 15 year-term and serve the remainder out on licence.Sentencing him, Judge Noel Lucas QC said: "The ordeal she was made to suffer is the worst nightmare of any woman."This was the abduction of a lone woman who was raped and subjected to vicious and prolonged sexual assaults."The effect of these assaults has been catastrophic."She no longer wants a relationship with a man, if she goes out feels she will be attacked, she is on anti-depressant medicines."She does not want to think about what happened to her but is unable to keep it from her mind, she feels like dying and thinks she should be dead."Attack: Police arrested the defendant after finding DNA on a cigarette dropped nearbyProsecutor Ruby Selva told the court the victim first noticed the defendant sat down in a wooded area as she was trying to make a phone call."She described immediately after walking past the defendant hearing someone coming up to her from behind," said Ms Selva."He grabbed hold of her and put his hands across her mouth and eyes and threw her to the floor."She was struggling and still had the phone in her hand."Ms Selva went on: "She thought she was going to die and wouldn't be going back home."He grabbed her with both hands and tried to strangle her.The court heard the woman was sexually assaulted before being dragged to a more secluded area nearby where he she was raped and suffered further abuse.The teenager fled when the victim screamed for help as "several people came into view" Ms Selva added.The court was told the defendant's saliva was found on a discarded cigarette butt at the scene, leading to his arrest two days later.When his mother asked if he had done anything wrong, he replied during his arrest: "No, I haven't done anything wrong."Another man was arrested on Saturday June 28 after his passport was discovered in Esher Road.The defendant alleged this now detained man had been present at the time of the attack armed with a knife and ordered him to "rape a woman or I'll stab you".But police concluded the arrested person was innocent and he was released without charge.The wrongfully accused person said in a statement he had been attacked and "made homeless" as a result of being falsely accused.Dr Ernest Gralton told the court the defendant was on the "mild end of the autistic spectrum".He added: "Many people with autism have learning disabilities but his IQ is the normal range of about 80."The court heard the defendant suffers from a personality disorder and has difficulty socialising and communicating.Dr Gralton concluded: "The combination of all these issues would meet the criteria for a mental disorder."Both Dr Gralton and Dr Ashimesh Roychowdhury recommended the defendant be detained in a hospital because he would get more support.The court heard that Dr Roychowdhury concluded he posed a "continued risk of further sexual assaults against adult females".But Judge Lucas, while acknowledging the guilty plea and the defendant's lack of maturity, refused to pass a hospital order and instead ordered that he be detained.The judge said he had seen nothing that "calls for a really serious case to be dealt with in a manner which is significantly different".In a statement read out in court, the victim said: "When I see a small group of young lads, I get scared"I have nightmares that someone is going to grab me or jump out in front of me."I feel because of what happened to me that I should die."I feel so sad and very upset. The incident has made my life very miserable because of over-thinking what has happened to me."
Deputy First Minister John Swinney has called for reform of the UK's "fundamentally flawed" transmission charging regime after it was announced that Longannet power station is likely to close early next year.Operator Scottish Power said on Monday that the coal-fired plant in Fife will "in all likelihood" close by March 2016 after losing out on a short-term National Grid contract.Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of Scottish Power retail and generation, said the current transmission charging regime was a "major barrier" to any future investment in thermal power generation in Scotland.Mr Swinney said the £40 million of transmission charges Longannet pays to connect to the grid due to its location in Scotland were "punitive" and suggested that the National Grid system was "not fit for purpose".Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, he denied that a proliferation of windfarms was jeopardising the supply from such stations.Mr Swinney said: "That's a ridiculous charge. We've all got obligations to de-carbonise electricity and the Scottish Government is taking a balanced set of measures to expand our renewable energy generation."The problem at the heart of this is the transmission charges. If the transmission charging regime is fundamentally flawed, if it does not acknowledge the fact that there are valuable and worthwhile supplies of energy able to be contributed to the grid but its impossible to generate those because of the punitive transmission charges, then the National Grid system is not fit for purpose, and that is the core point that has to be addressed at the heart of this debate."Whichever way we look at this, whatever question we approach, we come back to the fundamental issue that there must be reform of the ridiculous transmission charging system that penalises electricity generation that is further away from centres of population."Mr Swinney said replacing Longannet with new gas-powered station was "certainly an option" but said that "no consideration" was being given by the Scottish Government to its nationalisation.He added: "What we're experiencing with the decision at Longannet ... is decisions about energy policy being taken much earlier than are necessary because there is life left in Longannet, the plan was to maintain that power station to 2020 and, for the sake of the workforce, for the local community that will be severely affected by these changes, we think a more balanced decision should have been taken by National Grid which would have enabled Longannet to fulfil its working purpose until 2020."The Deputy First Minister raised concerns about the future security of the electricity supply with the closure of Longannet.He said: "The UK is operating on a model that would see us essentially having 2% extra capacity in the forthcoming winter as a consequence of decisions that have been taken and we think that that is far too tight a margin to be operating in."If the UK Government is serious about guaranteeing security of energy supply across the UK then decisions like the one that was taken that had implications for Longannet yesterday are decisions that should not have been taken."
Half of all migrants aged 16 and above in Scotland are qualified to at least degree level, new analysis show.Scotland’s chief statistician on Tuesday released new analysis of migrants in Scotland based on 2011 Census data.A total of 49% of migrants held at least degree level qualifications, compared to 26% of Scotland’s population as a whole.A further 60% of recent non-European Economic Area (EEA) migrants - people who arrived in the UK in the ten years prior to the 2011 Census – were educated to this level.Overall, migrants aged between 16 and 74 were equally likely to be working as the population as a whole.Recent migrants were most likely to be in work. Recent non-EEA migrants were least likely to be working, and of those inactive, 29% were students.A quarter of "established" migrants, people who came to live in the UK from overseas in 2001 or longer ago, reported their national identity as "Scottish only".Recent migrants were most likely to report "Other identity only" as their national identity. Non-EEA migrants were more ethnically and religiously diverse than EEA migrants.Just over half of established migrants had arrived in the UK when they were a child while recent migrants were most likely to have arrived when they were between 16 and 34 years oldJust two per cent of all migrants arrived when they were 50 years or older. They were more likely than those arriving at younger ages to have "no skills in English".Of all migrants, 89% were able to "speak, read and write English" and 2% had "no skills in English". It was also found that 42% spoke only English at home.The majority (81%) of all migrants lived in urban areas. They were less likely than the population as a whole to own their property and more likely to live in private rented housing.Feedback: We want your feedback on our site.

A British war veteran who dodged enemy bullets to help secure a French beach on D-Day has received the country's highest honour.Ted Turner was 18 when he sailed a tiny landing craft from Portsmouth to join Canadian troops at Normandy.The 89-year-old former Royal Marine, from Waterlooville, said it was a "great honour" to receive the Legion d'Honneur at a ceremony earlier.He is among the first UK veterans to be awarded the medal.Recalling the landings in 1944, Mr Turner said: "It was very quiet, no one spoke. Then when we got close to the beach, the Germans started firing and it was pretty noisy."I wasn't frightened. I was only young, so it felt a bit like an adventure to me, even at that stage."Mr Turner helped secure a beachhead on Juno beach while under fire from German soldiers and aircraft.He was presented with the French medal at the Royal Marines Museum in Southsea."I know that I'll be thinking of those who didn't make it, my friends who didn't come back from the Normandy beaches after D-Day," he said.After the war Mr Turner served in Germany, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and Japan.

Hampshire sailors on the Volvo Ocean Race all escaped unhurt from a dramatic 12 hours on stage five of the round-the-world event in the notorious Southern Ocean.Gosport’s Dee Caffari and Hamble’s Sam Davies, onboard the all-female Team SCA, toppled over along with Hamble’s Rob Greenhalgh on the Spanish-backed MAPFRE yacht and Dongfeng team.The incidents happened on rough seas, with all of those boats doing Chinese gybes – an accidental gybe caused by either strong wind or big wave that is alos known as a 'death roll'.It forces the main sail to slam over, the boat to end up in the water, with the keel on the wrong side keeping it on its side.The six-strong fleet are tussling with the dangerous Southern Ocean as they make their way from Auckland in New Zealand to Itajai in Brazil.Three of the six boats toppled over and Warsash skipper Ian Walker, onboard the Abu Dhabi boat alongside Southampton navigator Simon Fisher, also had eventful night.They reported a “night of two gybes, a wild one in pitch black with a massive wipe-out and then a ‘controlled’ one at 30 knots.”Davies and Caffari were upended at around 5am this morning.The team’s onboard reporter, Anna-Lena Elled, said: “We ended up on the side for maybe two to four minutes before slowly getting back in the right position.Despite the damage, nobody was hurt.Walker and his crew was able to recover from their hit and moved to within eight nautical miles of leaders Team Brunel.MAPRE also recovered and are currently third, around 26 nautical miles adrift of the leaders.SCA, however, slipped to almost 100 nautical miles behind top spot.

NUM calls for Eskom’s Tsotsi to be firedIT NEVER rains but pours for Eskom chairman Zola Tsotsi. Last week his colleagues on the board passed a motion of no confidence in him, on Monday the company’s biggest trade union added its voice and called on Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown to fire him.Citing a Business Day article in which Mr Tsotsi was accused of interfering in the company’s operational matters, hijacking executive responsibilities and undermining the company’s executives, the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) asked Ms Brown to fire Mr Tsotsi."The NUM has warned before that the state of corporate governance was degenerating at Eskom," the NUM general secretary Frans Baleni said.He said the union "feels vindicated when we objected to the reappointment of Zola Tsotsi as Eskom board chairperson. We also urge him to do the right thing, to resign before he is removed by force by our members."Asked if they had directly approached Ms Brown, Mr Baleni said the union had already called for the dismissal of the old board, which Mr Tsotsi has chaired since 2011."We were surprised that he was re-appointed (last year). We did inform the minister of our displeasure," said Mr Baleni.The state-owned electricity provider is in turmoil — both in the boardroom and on an operational level — after the board suspended the company’s four top executives on March 12, saying it needed them out of the way to investigate Eskom’s poor performance.Since 2008 the company has been struggling to meet electricity demand, resorting to rationing power with up to 34% of its capacity out of order at times. Its new infrastructure build programme has been delayed by more than four years.Eskom said it would investigate the poor state of affairs over the next three months, and selected a board committee headed by Mr Tsotsi to finalise the terms of reference for the investigation. Both City Press and The Sunday Independent newspapers reported on Sunday that board members declined to endorse the proposed terms of reference, and instead passed a vote of no confidence in Mr Tsotsi.The public enterprises minister met a board delegation on Friday, but the content of the discussion was not divulged, said spokesman Lionel Adendorf on Sunday.
Presidential candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC), General Muhammadu Buhari Monday in Owerri reviewed the downward slide of the nation’s economy and called on Nigerians to rise and say goodbye to the government of President Goodluck Jonathan.Buhari, who spoke as chieftains of the party and members of the APC Governors’ Forum, stormed Owerri, Imo State capital for a meeting, in their last minute campaign, said Nigeria would witness unmitigated disaster if President Jonathan was re-elected.While the APC Governors’ meeting was the first in the year, which they also tagged, “March for a New Nigeria”, Gen. Buhari used the opportunity to plead with Nigerians to shun tribal and clannish sentiments in electing a new President for the country.After taking a critical look at the performance of the nation’s economy in the last 16 years, Gen. Buhari said: “We   should all rise and say goodbye   to PDP because   no amount   of sentiment will justify voting for the PDP again.”The former head of state noted that while the value of the Naira had plummeted beyond imagination, revenue from oil had also dwindled, adding that insecurity, unemployment and corruption   had become   the order   of the day.After chronicling his record of service while in government, Buhari said that as serious crusader against corruption, he would sanitize the country, if given the opportunity to serve as president of Nigeria.Welcoming his guests earlier, Governor Rochas   Okorocha of Imo State, explained that APC Governors’ Forum was meant to build a bridge of friendship that would   traverse all nooks   and crannies of the country.While stressing that Igbo are found in all parts of the country, Okorocha also opined that this singular act helped in building bridges of unity and contributing to the economic development of the nation.
ROADWORKS at Thornbury Barracks roundabout are chaotic, says Ward Councillor Andrew Carter.Cllr Carter, who is a Calverley ward councillor and also leader of the Conservative Group on Leeds City Council, said diversions around the roadworks came in a day early – causing chaos and infuriating motorists.He said: “It is bad enough that these diversions have had to be put in place at all but to implement them early, and without notice, is nonsensical."What makes matters worse is that the advertisements for the diversions seem to be all over the place. The work is supposed to be finished by the April 24, but the road diversions say they are in operation for five weeks. To be frank, the chaos is so great, that the council must introduce night working throughout the period, to shorten the time of the diversions.”The council’s Highways Department has introduced a No Right Turn off the roundabout from Pudsey to Leeds, and no option to go straightforward to Calverley – all traffic has to turn left and go round the Thornbury Gyratory. Coming from Calverley there is no left turn to Bradford, and no way to go straight on to Pudsey, motorists can only turn left to Dawson’s Corner and then return back up the A647.
The Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williams enjoyed a kick-about with children at the Prism centre in GirlingtonPOLICE and Crime Commissioner Mark Burns-Williamson may have been sitting at his desk when he signed off a grant to stage a futsal sports tournament in Bradford, but he pulled on his sports gear to joined in the action when the project reached its finale.Bradford police worked with the Prism youth club in Walker Road, Girlington, to set up the futsal sessions, a form of five-a-side football.Prism is a youth club for the deaf and officers identified an issue with youngsters over communication, so set up the eight week course to help break down barriers.Mr Burns-Williamson backed the idea with a grant using cash reclaimed from criminals and further money was also made available from a sports charity.PC Joanne Armstrong said: “We established that we didn’t have very good links between the deaf community and police so they felt they could not report crime as a result.“To help with that, we thought the best way to engage with that community was through sport.”The futsal sessions have run over eight weeks and it is hoped they will have a lasting legacy of improved bonds between the deaf and police in the area.He said: “I gave a grant from the Safer Communities Fund and it is a fantastic way of re-investing some of that money into a project helping disadvantaged youngsters.”

The welterweight title unification fight May 2 in Las Vegas will generate $74 million from just over 15,000 tickets at MGM Grand Garden Arena, Pacquiao promoter Arum told ESPN, flattening the old mark of just over $20 million for Mayweather’s 2013 fight with Saul “Canelo” Alvarez in the same venue.Promoters first aimed for $40 million, then boosted the ticket prices from $1,000 to $1,500 at the low end and $5,000 to $7,500 for the best seats due to huge demand for the ducats, Arum said.But organizers have now shuffled the number of seats in various price ranges and boosted top seats to $10,000 to raise the live gate total from $50 million to $74 million.“It’s crazy, but it is what it is,” Arum told ESPN. “It’s amazing.” And few if any seats will be available for public sale, with promoters, telecasters HBO and Showtime, the fighters and the host venue each taking a share of the tickets.“We’ll probably have a handful of tickets that will go on sale to the public next week,” Arum said. “It’s mania.” There will be only about 1,100 seats at $10,000, none of them for public sale, according to the report.Boxing’s record for pay-per-view purchases is the 2.4 million buys from Mayweather’s 2007 split-decision victory over Oscar de la Hoya, but with Mayweather-Pacquiao having taken more than five years to come together with the planet’s top pound-for-pound fighters, expectations of 3 million pay-per-view buys at about $100 each could bring $300 million in sales for US, Puerto Rican and Canadian markets alone.“We wouldn’t have gotten a fraction of these numbers if we made the fight five years ago,” Arum said. “It turned out that we’re doing the fight at the right time, I guess, not that we’re geniuses for waiting this long.” Global rights are expected to ring up another $35 million, with a record $10 million already spent for rights in the Philippines, where Pacquiao is a Congressman as well as an iconic figure.“Between the gate, the foreign television sales and the closed circuit, which we can’t even calculate yet, you’re looking at over $120 million. And that’s before one pay-per-view has been sold in the US,” Arum told ESPN.Arum said Tecate beer, a long-time Pacquiao sponsor, won title sponsor rights with a $5.6 million bid, $400,000 more than rival Corona, a long-time backer of Mayweather.“We’ve never see anything like that on a beer sponsor,” Arum said. “Both companies were after it. It’s a huge number.” Mayweather’s camp receives 60% of the revenue with Pacquiao’s side taking home 40%. Arum said the contract gives Pacquiao the choice of who sings his homeland’s national anthem before the bout while Mayweather decides who will sing “The Star Spangled Banner.”
Most debts, such as clothing accounts, cellphones and credit card debt, prescribe after three years - if there has been no payment or acknowledgement of it and no summons in respect of it - and the consumer is then not obliged to pay the debt.
Aberdeenshire-based drinks firm BrewDog has seen annual profits rise by 69%.Profits reached £4.9m last year, from £2.9m in 2013, on turnover of £29.6m, up 64% from £18m.The company, founded eight years ago in Fraserburgh by James Watt and Martin Dickie, employs hundreds of people in Ellon. It opened 12 new bars last year, taking the total to 26.Mr Watt said: "2014 was an epic year for BrewDog and the craft beer industry as a whole."Among the new bars were six international ones, including one in Tokyo.BrewDog now exports its beers to 55 countries.The company had already announced 130 new jobs last month due to its continuing expansion.It was named by The Sunday Times Fast Track 100 as the fastest-growing food and drink company in the UK.
What was needed was an ongoing means by which they could earn a living,” said Gogo Chinodakufa, 65, in a recent interview.“To this end, I mobilised finances from well-wishers, and used the money to buy inputs with which to start farming projects. A group of youths and widows identified the land suitable for farming activities. The farmers share information that enables them to improve their land and crop management skills,” she said.The farming projects have seen beneficiaries using land in Seke’s Units F,N and P to grow maize, sweet potatoes, soya beans, vegetables and other crops. Currently, 12 youths, 10 elderly people and nine widows are participants in the project launched in 2007. This year, they are expecting to harvest a total of four tonnes of maize.After each household receives its share, the remaining crop will be sold. “Profits from sales are used to purchase inputs such as seed and fertiliser for the next season and the remaining money is shared among members.“I am glad to say that following the launch of this project, our members are now able to provide food for their families without having to beg. It’s a great relief to me that youths now have a sustainable source of income, because in the absence of formal employment, they tend to turn to drug abuse and other criminal activities. But this project is inspiring them to work hard and earn an honest living,” said Gogo Chinodakufa.The farming scheme has given birth to other income generating projects such as carpentry, with members using money they receive from selling farm produce to venture into activities of their own. “We have youths who, with encouragement, have now developed their own small business enterprises, using profits from the farming project,” said Gogo Chinodakufa.One of the project’s beneficiaries, Gogo Lucia Mapfeketsa, 71, paid tribute to Gogo Chinodakufa for having developed for her a means to earn a living. “My life has changed for the better since the introduction of this project. Before, I used to struggle to provide for my family and most of the time, we were forced to resort to begging from neighbours, but this has all changed now,” said Gogo Mapfeketsa.The coordinator of the farming project, Wilfred Ndiweni, 34, said: “In this time of high unemployment, this project has come as a lifesaver for youths in my area. The scheme has become our source of livelihood and we no longer have to worry about finding work because we are able to pay for rentals, school fees and groceries from this farming enterprise.”But he expressed concern over the issue of “land barons” who were threatening to take some of their farming space for housing purposes. “This is our greatest worry because some of our fields have been earmarked for housing and with the pace at which open spaces are being claimed, we have fears that our farming activities will be halted. This would adversely affect many families,” said Ndiweni. Have your say:
A skeleton first discovered in South Africa in 1994 has been confirmed as the earliest evidence of homonids on Earth.Nicknamed Little Foot, the 3.67-million-year-old skeleton was once part of the primate family that eventually led to early humans. Or, to give it its official name, Australopithecus prometheus.Scientists have debated the age of Little Foot, believing it to be anything between 2 million and 4 million years old.The mystery was finally solved through a new dating method called "isochron burial dating".It uses radioisotopes in various rock samples surrounding a fossil that helps determine when the rocks themselves were buried underground. As rocks are buried, certain radioactive isotopes (aluminium-26 and beryllium-10) start to decay.Sensors can then measure the degradation which allows the rock to be dated to within 160,000 years.The discovery means Little Foot pips the other famous Australopithecus prometheus fossil, nicknamed Lucy, to the title of oldest skeleton discovered."We have only a small number of sites and we tend to base our evolutionary scenarios on the few fossils we have from those sites," said Ronald Clarke, a professor of Evolutionary Studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa."This new date is a reminder that there could well have been many species of Australopithecus extending over a much wider area of Africa," Clarke, who discovered the Little Foot skeleton, told Purdue University.Ron Clarke, a professor in the Evolutionary Studies Institute at Wits University in South Africa holds the Little Foot skullThe Little Foot skeleton got its distinctive nickname because it was when looking through a box of fossils that Clarke identified four fragments from a homonid left foot.He returned to the cave, in Sterkfontein, South Africa, where the fossils came from and discovered the rest of the skeleton.
The first look at the Amy Winehouse documentary has arrived.Amy, which is from BAFTA award-winning director Asif Kapadia is due for release on July 3, follows the late singer over the course of her career before her untimely death at the age of 27.The documentary will tell the story of the singer’s life which was tragically cut short from her own point of view and that of her earliest friends.The trailer, set to a backdrop of Amy's haunting vocals from some of her biggest hits including Tears Dry on Their Own and Back to Black, shows Amy talking about fame and her life.In a hauntingly prescient interview from early on in her career, Amy can be heard talking about how she doens't think she'd be able to handle fame.Amy talks about her worries that fame would send her madShe says: "I don't think I'm going to be at all famous. I don't think I could handle it. I'd go mad, do you know what I mean? I'd go mad."She adds: "I never thought I'd be a singer. I just thought I'm lucky that it was something I could do if I want to. I'm so lucky like that," she says."I'm not a girl trying to be a star or trying to be anything other than a musician."The film will feature unseen footage and unheard tracks – creating a fresh look at the talented star.Universal boss David Joseph said: "About two years ago we decided to make a movie about her — her career and her life."It's a very complicated and tender movie. It tackles lots of things about family and media, fame, addiction, but most importantly, it captures the very heart of what she was about, which is an amazing person and a true musical genius."The rehab singer was aged just 27 when she was found dead on a Saturday afternoon in her Camden flat with two empty bottles of vodka beside her.At an inquest into her death, a verdict of misadventure was recorded.
Presumed Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has been asked three times in recent weeks what he makes of proposed religious freedom laws that are under consideration in several states.In two instances, Bush has called on the states to seek consensus and find ways to balance the personal opposition of some people to same-sex marriage with the need to protect gay people and same-sex couples from discrimination.Like other presumed GOP presidential candidates, Bush defended Indiana Gov. Mike Pence (R) during a radio show interview on Monday and gave his strongest defense of the law. But on Wednesday, he made comments at a California fundraiser that differed from what he said on the radio show. His most recent comments hew closely to what Bush first said about the topic of religious freedom laws when he was asked last month.Here's a look at each question and answer:We were with Bush when he visited Atlanta on March 19 and was asked by a local television reporter what he thought of a proposal for Georgia to pass a similar religious freedom law. The bill has since stalled in the legislature:"Religious freedom is a serious issue, and it's increasingly so, and I think people that act on their conscience shouldn't be discriminated against for sure and there should be protections. As it relates to marriage equality that may change, the Supreme Court may change that, that automatically then shifts the focus to people of conscience that out of their faith may want to act on their faith and may not be able to be employed, for example or may not want to provide services for a gay wedding. People I think have the right to do that just as we need to be respectful of people who are in long-term committed relationships. Sorting that out is important."On Monday, Bush was asked specifically about Indiana's broader religious protection law during an appearance on "The Hugh Hewitt Show:"Bush: "I think if you, if they actually got briefed on the law that they wouldn’t be blasting this law. I think Governor Pence has done the right thing. Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to have, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all." Hewitt: "You know, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed in 1993. It’s been the law in the District of Columbia for 22 years. I do not know of a single incidence of the sort that Tim Cook was warning about occurring in the District in the last 22 years." Bush: "But there are incidents of people who, for example, the florist in Washington State who had a business that based on her conscience, she couldn’t be participating in a gay wedding, organizing it, even though the person, one of the people was a friend of hers. And she was taken to court, and is still in court, or the photographer in New Mexico. There are many cases where people acting on their conscience have been castigated by the government. And this law simply says the government has to have a level of burden to be able to establish that there’s been some kind of discrimination. We’re going to need this. This is really an important value for our country to, in a diverse country, where you can respect and be tolerant of people’s lifestyles, but allow for people of faith to be able to exercise theirs."On Wednesday, Bush was asked about Indiana's new law at a closed-door fundraiser in Silicon Valley, in an exchange first reported by The New York Times. In response, Bush aides provided a full transcript of his response to a question about the law:"What I do believe -- that protecting religious freedom is something that’s important and it has to be done state by state because the current federal law only applies to federal activities. The Supreme Court ruled that. So twenty states, twenty states have gone about this and by the end of the week, I think Indiana will be in the right place which is to say that we need in a big diverse country like America, we need to have space for people to act on their conscious. "That it is a constitutional right that religious freedom is a core value of our country and simultaneously with that we need to protect the rights of people—in this particular case the concern relates to sexual orientation but it could be anything. That there shouldn’t be -- we should not have -- we shouldn’t discriminate based on sexual orientation. So what the state of Indiana is going to end up doing is probably get to that place. "The better approach would have been the approach that is the more consensus-oriented approach I think. I’m not being critical of Mike Pence because I did say that I supported his efforts, which was the Utah case. Did you hear about the Utah case out of curiosity? It was two months ago it never made news. I think it was a similar kind of issue where you have these court cases now where people’s conscious are being sued for not participating in religious ceremonies and my personal belief is that that’s inappropriate. "And so Utah went about this, but what they did is they brought all the constituencies together and this included the leadership of the LDS Church and [LGBT] community and said how can we forge a consensus where we can protect religious freedom and also create an environment where we’re not discriminating against people. And they figured it out and they passed a law. There wasn’t a bunch of yelling and screaming. That to me seems like a better approach to dealing with this. "But I do fear that certain freedoms that historically have been part of our DNA as a country now are being challenged and I don’t think it’s appropriate. I do think if you’re a florist and you don’t want to participate in the arrangement of a wedding, you shouldn’t have to be obliged to do that if it goes against your faith because you believe in traditional marriage. Likewise if someone walked into a flower shop as a gay couple and said I want to buy all these off the rack, these flowers, they should have every right to do it. That would be discrimination. But forcing someone to participate in a wedding is not discrimination; it is I think protecting the first amendment right."Utah's new Religious Freedom Restoration Act has been heralded by religious leaders and gay rights groups alike for adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the state's anti-discrimination laws for housing and employment; expanding exemptions for religious institutions and their affiliates; and providing protections for religious expression.In each answer, Bush urged states to protect people who are personally opposed to same-sex marriage, but not to pass laws that would discriminate against same-sex couples or gay people. It's just that on Hewitt's program he more forcefully defended Pence's decision. Given the radio program's mostly conservative audience, perhaps that's not surprising.
Readers have had much to say today on sixpences and hankies, mentioned in yesterday's column. Helen Gee of Armidale remembers, "We usually had our hankies secured to our dress with a safety pin but a good time waster after lunch was to find a stray hanky in the playground and go around, class to class, trying to find an owner."Lee McKenzie of Pearl Beach says, "When I was a Brownie many years ago we had to carry two pennies at all times to use the public phone in case of an emergency. Now, no doubt, they all carry their mobile phones."Mike Phillips of Wollstonecraft puts his tuppence's worth in about the sixpence. "A sixpence was worth something long after Queen Victoria's day. When I left school in 1950 and started work in London, sixpence bought me a newspaper and my Tube fare. Twice a day, and five days a week, that took 25 per cent of my weekly salary.""We young people at secondary school in the early 50s remember when one shilling purchased two bottles of Snowcap Champagne and a bucket of ice cream at the tuckshop," offers Michael Whiteley of Mortdale. Michael brings up a whole new mystery: What on earth was Snowcap Champagne, and was it as dreadful as it sounds?Another currency problem comes from Christopher May of Balgowlah. "When I first came to Australia more than 30 years ago, copper coins were still currency. I got into the habit of tossing them in the back of the cupboard. What do you do with over 2 kilograms of copper coins?"Back to the subject of in and on (Column 8 for many days). Peter Nunan of Dareton adds, "Peter Stuart's reference to contradictory language as applied to surfing equally applies to golf. When you drive, you walk. You can finish a round all square. You can finish one down and yet be one up.""Speaking of appalling inequality of punishment [as Column 8 was yesterday], feminist Column 8 might like to know there is a long history of discrimination in punishment. Back during the trials by ordeal in 12th century and earlier, men were much more likely to be sentenced to ordeal by water (where they chuck you in the water and see if you sink or float) than women, who were more likely to be made to hop around with an iron in their hand." This from Kate Leader, of London, Leichhardt and "temporarily of Neutral Bay". It just goes to show, this Column 8 thinks, that some things never change, men go swimming and women get stuck with the ironing.
The Sacramento Kings are reportedly poised to sign Sim Bhullar to a 10-day contract that would make the towering centre the first player of Indian descent in the NBA.ESPN was among the US media outlets reporting on Wednesday that the Kings, owned by Indian software magnate Vivek Ranadive, expect to bring Bhullar in from the Reno Bighorns, Sacramento's affiliate in the NBA Development League.The 7-foot-5-inch (2.3m) Bhullar has spent the entire season with the Bighorns, after attending the Kings' pre-season training camp.Bhullar is averaging 10.3 points, 8.8 rebounds and 3.9 blocks in the D-League this season.The 22-year-old, who was born in Canada to Indian-born parents, is expected to replace David Wear on Sacramento's roster after Wear's 10-day contract expires on Thursday.Bhullar was a two-time Western Athletic Conference Tournament Most Valuable Player for New Mexico State University as they reached the NCAA Tournament in 2013 and 2014.He was undrafted last June but was brought into training camp by the Kings before landing in Reno.Ranadive, the NBA's first Indian-born owner, said last August when the team brought Bhullar into training camp that he believed India was "the next great frontier" for the league.
MANCHESTER, ENGLAND - MARCH 10: Radamel Falcao of Manchester United U21s in action during the Barclays U21 Premier League match between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford on March 10, 2015 in Manchester, England. (Photo by Matthew Peters/Man Utd via Getty Images)Radamel Falcao’s loan move to Manchester United has been a disaster.But there is still time to make the best of a bad situation.The Colombian has not become a bad player overnight - and Louis van Gaal is in no position to ignore a striker who, on his day, remains one of the deadliest in world football.He went some way making that point when embraced by the arms of his nation during this international break.The question is whether the message got through to Van Gaal.As well as three goals in two games for Colombia came the not so subtle reminder that he is ready and available for the season’s run-in.It was an emphatic statement of intent.“I need to play,” said the 29-year-old. “I need minutes and I am confident about me, about my fitness.”At least somebody is, for Van Gaal’s faith in the on-loan Monaco forward appears to be at rock bottom.With no starts since the end of February, Falcao’s miserable spell at Old Trafford is in danger of fizzling out with a whimper.But that doesn’t have to be the case.He is understood to have made his mind up to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season, while the chances of United agreeing to pay the £43m required to make his loan move permanent have dissipated by the week.The choice now is whether to see out an awkward couple of months before sending him back to the south of France - or turn this into a mutually beneficial relationship.Goals against Bahrain and Kuwait hardly suggest Falcao is back to the player he was before suffering career-threatening cruciate ligament damage last year.Yet it was evidence that he can still be effective if given the opportunity.His professionalism during a humbling period has been commendable - and he resisted the temptation to reveal his full frustrations when away with his country.He wouldn’t be the first player to use an international break as a chance to air grievances.Instead Falcao did what he does best - scored goals and proved what an asset he is on the pitch.Van Gaal has failed to get the best out of Falcao this seasonThat should be appreciated by Van Gaal, even if it is clear the player doesn’t figure in his long-term plans.United have found their best form operating with Wayne Rooney at the point of the attack and Marouane Fellaini in support.There will be little appetite to alter a formula that secured morale-boosting wins against Tottenham and Liverpool. And with Robin van Persie set to return from ankle injury, Falcao faces increased competition for a place in Van Gaal's team.Four goals in 22 appearances are evidence of his struggles this season.But at a time when United’s push for the Champions League is gathering momentum, he is the type of player who can still make a difference in pivotal games.Read: Falcao wants Manchester United exit - even if Van Gaal is keen to keep himTeddy Sheringham spent the 1998-99 season in the shadows of Dwight Yorke and Andy Cole - yet his campaign was defined by goals in the FA Cup and Champions League finals as United clinched the Treble.Arguably only Arsenal, of United’s third and fourth place rivals, have the depth of attacking talent to be able to call a player of Falcao’s calibre from the bench in a tight game.Even a return to his prolific best is unlikely to prompt United to try to convince him to stay beyond the summer.Interest in Gareth Bale and Memphis Depay points to a determination to add pace and youth to his attack next season.The Dutchman is, however, a pragmatist and he knows Champions League qualification is a must.If Falcao can help him deliver that then his move to United might not turn out to be a complete disaster after all.See our gallery below for the results of our 'keep or sell' survey
Any A-League title contenders who take battling Western Sydney lightly do so at their own peril, coach Tony Popovic says.The Wanderers may be well out of finals contention but with the ladder the tightest it has ever been, Popovic's men could still have a big say on how the top six shape up. With four rounds remaining the Wanderers begin their run home against sixth-placed Melbourne City at Parramatta Stadium on Friday.In a fortnight they also host Adelaide, who sit two points adrift of leaders Wellington, and play their last round of the regular season against Perth, who are only a point behind the frontrunners.The Wanderers have had some encouraging results of late, thumping Brisbane 4-1 last week and matching it with Glory on Saturday only to go down 3-2 courtesy of a late winner. Locked in a battle with Newcastle Jets to avoid the wooden spoon, Western Sydney won't go down without a fight. Popovic says teams should be wary of underestimating them."If you look at our performances in the last few weeks you can see how determined we are to finish the season strong," he said."Those top sides might feel that when they play us it's possibly a game where they should get three points but if they take us lightly I'm certain they won't get that result."City look all but assured of the sixth and final play-off berth with Brisbane sitting eight points behind, but with the Roar possessing a game in hand they still can't afford too many slip-ups.City enter the clash off a three-game winning streak, their last defeat coming at the hands of the Wanderers. "We expect another good performance against City like we had in our last meeting," Popovic said. "They're doing very well, they've won three straight."They're in the six and I'm sure they want to stay there so they'll come fully focused."Popovic's depleted squad will get a boost this week with striker Tomi Juric back from international duty, Popovic also confirming Mateo Poljak (calf) and Mark Bridge (groin) are set to return from injury.Melbourne City also get key midfielder Aaron Mooy back from Socceroos duty.
TRADITION: Shining the shoes of Karla Hornby, of Breightmet, are, from left, Craig Holden, of Zac's Youth Bar in Farnworth, Rev Christine Threlfall, Bishop of Bolton, the Rt Rev Chris Edmondson and Andrew Partington, of St George the MartyrsTRADITION: Bishop of Bolton, the Rt Rev Chris Edmondson, shines the shoes of Jimi ParryTHE Bishop of Bolton is a shining example to us all — and that's official.For the Rt Rev Chris Edmondson, along with local clergy and chaplains, took to the town centre to shine people's shoes as part of a special Easter tradition.The event in Newport Square yesterday was a twist on the tradition of Christian clergy washing feet on Maundy Thursday.Rt Rev Edmondson said: "This is the sixth year I've done this. People are intrigued or surprised that we are doing this."It's a way of communicating the fact Jesus washed his disciples' feet on Maundy Thursday."We are doing a 21st century equivalent. Some people know why we are doing it, other people have no idea."On the night before Jesus was crucified, he hosted what would be his last supper.Before they ate their meal, Jesus washed the feet of his disciples — an unclean task normally reserved for servants.By washing the feet of his followers, Jesus demonstrated to them that they were to serve, bring healing and live in humility.This was his ‘new commandment’ or Maundy, hence Maundy Thursday.Bolton grandmother Daisy Jones said: "I think it's very nice. I think it's a wonderful thing that they are doing. I've seen them washing the feet in church."They've done a good job, I can see my face in my shoes."Rt Rev Edmondson added: "More than anything else, Easter is a sign of hope and new life. There are a lot of difficulties and troubles in the world and a lot of people have challenges to cope with."On Saturday, Bolton Christian Community Cohesion will host a free family fun day with activities, as well as practical support for people facing problems such as debt or joblessness.It will take place from 11am until 2pm, in Victoria Square, with an address from the Bishop at noon.On Easter Sunday, he will take part in a service at Manchester Cathedral, to be screened on BBC One at 10am.
The mere mention of Somalia elicits images of poverty or violent conflict for most people who have never travelled to the nation in the Horn of Africa.Their only exposure tends to be upsetting scenes on their television screens or negative stories in the newspaper, but its people are using the power of social media to show their homeland in a positive light.One of the brightest stars, Ugaaso Abukar Boocow, has become a celebrity on Instagram, where she is trying to change people’s perceptions with photos and videos that reveal a side of Somalia that most people have never seen.With 68,000 followers, Ugaaso’s Instagram feed is a mixture of selfies, snapshots of daily life and Somali traditions, and humorous photos or videos.The 27-year-old’s followers and others who stumble upon her posts are surprised to see pictures that showcase peaceful scenes, happy faces and stunning beauty spots, including the blue waters of the Indian Ocean and white-sand beaches.It's also a project of discovery for Ugaaso, who works as a civil servant, and was two years old when she and her grandmother fled Somalia’s civil war and moved to Canada.Ugaaso settled in Toronto and lived there until she moved back to Mogadishu, Somalia's capital, last year to reunite with her mum.She told MailOnline Travel that she began posting photos as a way to keep in touch and assure her family and friends in Toronto that she was safe.She said: ‘I try to be true to my world when I post. I post what I see and know to be true about Somalia - beaches, fresh fruit drinks, hauntingly beautiful architecture.’She soon learned that there was an appetite for photos that showed a positive side to Somalia, and has amassed a legion of followers since she began posting pictures and videos regularly last August.Ugaaso said she is embracing her newfound fame and believes it’s her responsibility to show outsiders what everyday life is really like in the East African nation.She said: ‘They're delighted to see a different Somalia. I believe they've been furtively rooting for us in their hearts all along.‘Rooting for us to be courageous, to overcome. They've dreamed a better world for us and now they get to see that world materialised on Instagram.’She's still getting used to strangers recognising her from her photos and stopping her on the street.'They're really proud of me here in Somalia. I'm amusing to them. They're often stunned at my ability to speak the language flawlessly and they encourage me to continue showing the world "our" world - the ravishing Somalia known to "us".'
When it comes to getting a stunning view of New York, most people would be content with taking a trip to the top of the Empire State building.But not this teenager, who goes by the name of Dark.Cyanide. Instead he climbs up some of the city's tallest buildings, without ropes or harnesses, before sitting on precarious ledges - all in the name of capturing the perfect photograph.Many of the 18-year-old's vertigo-inducing images, which include some shot 72 storeys above street level, show his feet dangling hundreds of feet above the city streets below in his trademark turquoise trainers.He says that building security often stops him from climbing some landmarks, but even if he can get past the guards, battling strong winds at high altitude often presents an even bigger challenge.He said: 'What I like the most about photographing New York is that it's huge. I can never stop finding new places to photograph and go wandering into.'The city is always growing and always providing new views with new skyscrapers being built. I am most fascinated by the views and different vantage points I come across.'People are amazed by my rooftop pictures because they have never seen such a great views and vantage points of New York before.'His photographs include shots of the Chrysler Building, the Empire State Building, and the building around Times Square as they have rarely been seen before.As well as taking pictures of urban landscapes from the rooftops of New York, Dark.Cyanide also specialises in shots of abandoned buildings and underground tunnels dotted around the city.His Instagram page has more than 8,000 followers, and on his webpage he describes himself as an 'NYC photographer' and 'urban historian' dedicated to capturing the sights and sounds of the city from different viewpoints.
A mound of refuse in the back garden of a property in the Ardnacassa Avenue area.Last week’s monthly meeting of Longford County Council’s Longford Municipal District heard about a growing refuse problem in sections of the Ardnacassa Avenue housing estate in Longford town.The issue was raised by Cllr John Browne (FG), who circulated photographs taken in the Cluain Ard and Palace Crescent areas of the estate, which showed a build-up of refuse at a number of properties.“There are burnt-out houses and rubbish,” he said. “The place needs to be tidied.”The Cathaoirleach of the Municipal District, Cllr Mae Sexton, branded the situation as “absolutely outrageous”.“The problem is with the privately-owned houses,” she asserted.Cllr Gerry Warnock (Ind) said it was time to “take the gloves off and play hardball” with the property owners.“This is disgusting and it will attract vermin,” he noted. “These heaps of rubbish didn’t appear overnight; it’s happened over time. We’ve given people enough time to clean up. It’s time to go for the jugular.”Cllr Browne continued by saying, “We could repossess these houses as derelict properties. As Gerry said, we should take the gloves off.”He also pointed out that the Council’s roadsweeper had not visited the area: “I saw it in College Park at lunch time, but I don’t see it in Ardnacassa Avenue. There was a fire there on one of the greens last November and the remains are still there.”The councillors’ desire for direct action was tempered by Longford County Council Director of Services, Frank Sheridan, who reminded them that they did not possess the powers to deal with the issue at municipal district level.“We need to be realistic about what we do,” he explained. “Your function has changed (since Longford Town Council was abolished). You have no statutory powers at municipal district level. Can I suggest you get together with the County Council and work on it there?”Asking the Council’s Housing Department to prepare a report, Cllr Sexton said, “It’s up to us to put a joint notice of motion to the County Council for this to be prioritised.”
TWO ARMED robbers who are said to have specialised in robbing customers of banks, have been apprehended by the Tema Regional police after allegedly robbing a Universal Merchant Bank (UMB) customer at the Heavy Industrial Area in Tema, Greater Accra Region.The suspects, Eric Asante, 23 years old and Richard Osei, 29, were busted after they had allegedly attacked and robbed the customer, who was believed to have cashed some money from the bank.Information gathered indicates that the robbers, usually on board a Toyota Corolla taxi with registration number GT 6536 -12, park in front of banks under the pretext of providing service to customers, only to attack and rob them when they (customers) hire their service.Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Juliana Obeng, the Public Affairs Manageress of the Tema Regional Police Command, informed a section of the media that the incident occurred at about 8:30 am last Tuesday, March 31, 2015.According to her, the victim, Samuel Christian Attipoe, was rescued by a police officer stationed at Choice Financial Service at the Heavy Industrial Area.She explained that some persons who noticed the criminal activities of the two men alerted the police constable, adding that the policeman, armed with such information, monitored the activities of the robbers who had parked in front of the UMB waiting for someone who had cashed money from the financial institution to rob.Attipoe, who had completed his transaction at the bank, purportedly boarded the taxi and on reaching an intersection of the road, ASP Obeng asserted, he was asked by Richard to surrender his properties at gun point, as the suspects allegedly seized all that he had on him and was ordered to alight.ASP Juliana Obeng continued that the officer who had noticed the criminal operation, fired gunshots at the back tyre of the cab but the suspects refused to stop and rather increased the speed of the vehicle.They were given a hot chase by the policeman who took another taxi and with the help of the visibility police personnel, the suspects were rounded up.Police retrieved two locally manufactured pistols with five live ammunitions, a hood, a wallet containing GH¢85.00, dry leaves suspected to be Indian hemp wrapped in plastic material and Adehyene Savings and Loans booklet, bearing the name Mary Abrefi, when a search was conducted on the vehicle.
Tension was high in a village in Meru County following two days of intense gun fight between police reservists and raiders that left one person injured.Our police reservists engaged the raiders in a gunfight for four hours on Sunday and Monday this week until they fled. The police officers in about five camps are yet to act,” Mr Ntiritimi said.Police officers have had information of imminent attacks by cattle rustlers but they only visited the scene after animals had been stolen, Mr Ntiritimi claimed.“We are asking the government to cooperate with herders because we know our stolen animals are at Daaba area.“We have shared the information with police officers and provincial administrators but we are yet to recover the animals. We are calling on the government to take our plight seriously,” he said.Police reservist Atanasio Mugambi said a herder was shot in the hip as they exchanged fire with about 10 raiders at Bulu on Monday.“On Sunday and Monday this week, we were ambushed by raiders in the morning hours as the animals left the manyattas. We managed to fight them off after several hours,” Mr Mugambi said.“Grazing committees have been formed to ensure the movement of herders from communities in the area are well monitored.“There is no lapse on security because police reservists work with other police officers. We have been able to recover several animals in Samburu and Daaba due to cooperation between herders and security officers. We are working with grazing committees to recover all stolen animals,” he said.“This number of livestock is significant for the economy of the county and the devolved government must plan for the pastoral community,” Mr Kamwibua said.

General Muhammed Buhari will, on 29 May, be sworn in as President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria having been declared winner of the 28 March presidential election. As Nigerians and indeed the entire world anxiously await this historic hand over, it is gratifying that the incoming government knows the huge task before it.After being subjected to several years of hardship occasioned by inept leadership, Nigerians are anxious for change and purposeful leadership. The over 15 million votes cast for the All Progressives Congress, APC Presidential Candidate, Gen Muhammed Buhari, against the ruling party’s 12 million votes, was a clear reflection of that yearning. With the elections concluded, the winning party must hit the ground running as quickly as possible.While it is practically impossible to solve all the problems confronting the nation in a short time, there are certain urgent issues that the incoming government must tackle immediately. One of such issues is the security challenge facing the country. For years, the Boko Haram terrorist sect has unleashed untold mayhem on most parts of the north. Thousands of our compatriots have been killed by the sect. The outgoing government waited too late before routing the extremists on the eve of the general elections.As the new government takes over in May , the expectation of Nigerians is that a full blown war will be declared against the Boko Haram insurgents. A review of past efforts to battle the insurgents must be carried out with a view of identifying their weakness and strength. The military must also be orverhauled to be able to defend the territorial integrity of our nation.Aside security, the another top priority issue for Nigerians is electricity. The incoming government must immediately make power generation and distribution a top agenda on its list of programmes. Nigerians want electricity and anything short of that is unacceptable. In meeting this challenge, the new government must review all previous power generation and distribution contracts to ensure that companies awarded contracts are able to deliver the terms of such contract. The new government must know that the expectations of Nigerians are high and that if nothing positive is done about electricity within a short time, they will be disappointed.Currently, our economy is in serious crisis. The exchange rate has sky-rocketed while the various sectors of the economy are in a state of comatose. The new government was voted in on the strength of its promise to bring about change in the economy. This promise must be kept to the letter. In revamping the economy, competent professionals must be appointed to the right offices to man the affairs of various sectors. Current policies which are anti-masses must also be quickly reviewed.While there is no doubt that there is work to be done in other areas such  as job creation, youth empowerment, health, manufacturing, education, agriculture, housing, insurance, banking, telecommunications, etc., the new government must first get its priority right. We as a people are faced with multiple challenges but any government that wants to succeed must concentrate on areas where we have the greatest shared needs. Above all, institutions must be strengthtened, there must be an end to corruption and impunity across the land.
Dundee United have responded to the statement issued by two fans’ groups by highlighting the club’s most recent achievements.ArabTRUST and the Federation of Dundee United Supporters’ Clubs issued a joint statement on Wednesday night which raised a number of concerns over how the Tangerines were being run.The answer to those criticisms of chairman Stephen Thompson and his board came in the form of a club statement that stressed United would be sticking to their “professional and comprehensive strategy.”It read: “The board of Dundee United has noted the statement issued by two Dundee United supporters’ organisations.“All supporters can be assured that the board will continue to implement its professional and comprehensive strategy for the football club.“This strategy and the related actions of the chairman and board of directors have delivered progress both on and off field.“On field the club has reached back-to-back domestic cup finals for the first time in 29 years, qualified for European competition in three of the last four years, finished in the Premiership top six (formerly SPL) in every one of the last seven years and won the Scottish Cup in 2010.“The current management team and players are also sitting fourth in the Premiership this season with sights firmly set on securing a European qualification place.“Off field the board has reduced overall debt, including Thompson family loans, from £5.2 million in February 2014 to £2.6 million while successfully extricating the club from all bank debt.“The club debt is projected to be reduced to £1.4 million by the end of this year.“And, in a period where Scottish football clubs have faced some of the most challenging economic times in history, the club continues to pursue its strategic objectives and invests in facilities for the future.“Supporters can rest assured that the board is comprised of individuals that are, without exception, Dundee United supporters.“They bring with them a wealth of experience in business.“At all times, the board acts to promote the success of Dundee United and will continue to do so.”In their statement, ArabTRUST and the Federation said they were “shocked” that an alleged quarter of £6.3 million worth of transfer fees - has been paid to unnamed third parties. This claim, however, has not been confirmed by the club.The strongly-worded statement also criticised “the overall management of the club,” which has just announced profits of £1.2 million.It said: “It is with regret that we have to make such a statement.“However, we feel that following the discussions held we have no other option and it is our duty to do so as shareholders in the club and as elected members of the committees of fans representative bodies.“We were shocked to find out that a huge amount of ‘commission’ has been paid to unnamed parties from the sale of four players – Gauld, Robertson, Armstrong and Mackay-Steven.“We believe this figure to be in excess of £500k. This does not include payments to players, agents or other clubs. When all of these various payments are totalled, over 25% of the £6.3m in fees received has not been kept in the club.”The joint statement concluded: “Given the points above, we believe that changes are required as to how Dundee United is managed.“We want our club to be successful and stable, both on and off the park.“Both ArabTRUST and the Federation wish only the best for Dundee United; the club is deep within our hearts and we hope that by the time we formally meet again with the Board of DUFC that the necessary changes have been made to improve the management of the club and allow us in the future to prosper on the field.”
New homes built with garages but no drivewayA NEW housing development in Barrhead has been “the talk of the steamie” — although not for the reason the builder might hope.Eagle-eyed bus passengers passing the new Bellway Homes site on Kelburn Street in Barrhead have spotted something unusual with the company’s show homes.The modern homes have been built with beautifully landscaped gardens and large double garages — with no driveways.Instead, flower beds fill the space in front of the garage and there appears to be no sensible way to access the garage without trudging through flowers and compost.One Neilston pensioner, who phoned The News to point out the odd situation, said: “It’s been providing us on the bus with a few good laughs, we can’t understand it.”But the company behind the homes, on the site of a former Volvo truck garage, say they are delighted that people are taking an interest in the development and there is a logical explanation for the apparent blunder.Fraser Conn, sales and marketing director for Bellway Scotland said: “We are delighted that local people are taking an interest in our development and would welcome people to pay a visit. The two properties are designed as showhomes to enable visitors to view furnished examples of the properties for sale at Westgrove.“The double garage of the larger house has been converted into a temporary sales office which will be transformed into a garage when no longer needed. Similarly the drive of the other property has been landscaped to make it more convenient and a pleasant experience for visitors to the showhomes and ensure that visitors use the designated car park. Again, this will be reverted to a driveway when no longer needed as a showhome.“It is standard practice at new build developments but visitors will also be able to see the actual driveways and garages of both house styles if they wish when further properties are built on site.”
The theatre will literally be performed underground. Photo: Festival de CavesFrom next month and to late June, France will be hosting a festival that is literally "underground": a series of stage shows where private cellars become confidential theatres.The Festival des Caves, as it is called ("cave" is French for cellar), will pop up -- or is that down? -- in 75 towns and villages across the country in a decade-old tradition sponsored by a growing number of municipalities.Nearly 300 shows will be put on during the May 1-June 26 festival, with each evening being particularly intimate. Because of safety rules, a maximum of only 19 audience members at a time can watch."The public is really into it. There isn't a single mobile phone that rings," the festival's founder, Guillaume Dujardin, told a news conference on Wednesday."Mayors from the smallest villages are inviting us in, and some of them never go to the theatre," he added.Last year attracted 4,465 people to some 240 shows. Each person, who signed up beforehand, was called on the eve of the play and told where to go. Ticket prices are 10 or 12 euros ($11 or $13).Many private hosts have returned to lend their underground spaces to the initiative. Others are recruited through a curious-sounding local newspaper ad saying "festival seeks cellar for theatre play".Georges, who owns a concrete cellar/garage in the north of Paris, said he was "impressed by the professionalism and inventiveness of the shows Ihosted". He even offers drinks after the show in his small garden.The line-up of plays is eclectic, though organisers said many dug deep into the subject of identity.Some, naturally, are about figures imprisoned in small, windowless spaces -- including one about the famous Marquis de Sade to be put on under the Cheateau de Vincennes in the east of Paris, where the sex-obsessed aristocrat was locked up between 1777 and 1784.
A US man cannot continue his efforts to salvage what he believes are platinum bars worth almost $4 billion off Cape Cod.A US treasure hunter's effort to salvage what he calls $US3 billion ($A3.95 billion) in platinum from a World War II shipwreck off Cape Cod has been ended by a federal judge.Greg Brooks' company Sea Hunters LP is no longer allowed to salvage additional items from the SS Port Nicholson, which was sunk by a Nazi U-boat in 1942, US District Judge George Singal ruled on Wednesday.Brooks said he believed the Port Nicholson carried platinum bars from the Soviet Union that were payment to the US for war supplies. His treasure hunt had led to a criminal investigation and legal action by investors who paid him millions of dollars.The judge also denied an attempt by a group of investors to win recovery rights, claims to what's on the ship if anything is found. The judge wrote that evidence suggests there's nothing valuable to salvage.The record, the judge wrote, suggests that all that remains is "70-year-old truck tyres, fenders and miscellaneous other parts and military supplies."Brooks, whose company is based in Gorham, said he wishes he could talk in depth about the case to provide "the real story" but his lawyers want him to be silent."I will say one thing, I still believe the cargo is aboard the PN," he wrote in an email. "I just cannot fight countries."Brooks said he located the Port Nicholson wreck in 2008. His claim of valuable precious metals aboard led to a splash in the media in 2012, but there were immediate questions about the veracity of it.
INEC officials reported early in many polling stations   across the country this morning in readiness for the smooth conduct of the  gubernatorial and state assembly elections. Accreditation of voters is also reportedly going well with many voters stating that the card readers did not give problems, as was the case during the Presidential elections two weeks ago. Voting proper is due to get under way from 1 pm as soon as   the 68.8 million registered voters have been duly accredited, according to our reporters. Meanwhile, President Goodluck Jonathan has appealed to candidates   ​in​ today​’s​ Governorship and House of Assembly elections to accept ​the ​outcome of the ​​​elections. “I urge contestants to respect the will of the people as we promote a new Nigeria that is a pacesetter and light bearer in the practice of democratic politics without bitterness. May God bless Nigeria,” he posted on his Facebook page yesterday evening.
The Bundoran RNLI were called into action on Monday evening last when they rescued a woman from the waters of Tullan Strand in Bundoran.The rescue team were alerted to the scene shortly after 8pm when a passer-by in the local area noticed a female surfer in difficulty. The volunteer crew of the Bundoran RNLI Lifeboat then received a request from the Coast Guard at Malin Head to attend to the woman.The crew of the Atlantic 85 launched within four minutes of receiving the request and were at the scene within three minutes.The crew pulled the woman and her surfboard from the water before performing several medical checks. The surfer was shaken but did not sustain any injuries. She was then taken ashore by the rescue team.Speaking on return to land, crew member Killian O’Grady said the crew were thankful to the passer-by who had raised the alarm. He said: “That person did the right thing by calling the Coast Guard.“Darkness was beginning to fall and had it been any later, the situation may have turned a lot more dangerous.”Mr O’Grady urged anyone who plans to go out on the water, especially those as potentially hazardous as the seas off the Atlantic Coast, to be extremely vigilant and to prepare themselves for the unexpected. He warned: “As the weather improves, we want people to enjoy themselves but we would urge water users to exercise common sense and heed basic water safety principles.”Sea safety advice is available on rnli.org
Wicked Campers must remove violent, misogynist, racist and homophobic slogans from its rental fleet, activists say.The Brisbane-based hire company has established its identity by painting shocking and lewd slogans on the side of its campervans vans for years.Community outrage at one particular slogan - "in every princess is a little slut who wants to try it just once" - led to the federal Senate unanimously passing a motion calling for it to be removed in July 2014.At the time Wicked Campers founder John Webb removed the slogan, but activists say there are still countless other offensive slogans on the vans.Wicked Pickets founder Liz Upham says slogans like "she can't wrestle, but you should see her box", "fat chicks are harder to kidnap", "it's better to be black than gay because you don't have to tell your parents" and "a wife: an attachment you screw on the bed to get the housework done" do not belong on the streets."They're saying it's ok to kidnap a woman, they're saying it's ok to use gaffer tape against a woman, they're pretty much saying it's ok to rape a woman: that's what their messages are," she said."You couldn't put this stuff on a fixed billboard, how is it acceptable for these slogans to be driven down our streets in front of us and our children?"Ms Upham's group was hoping to meet with Attorney-General Yvette D'Ath soon to talk about tightening state laws to stop the slogans.Queensland Labor Senator Clare Moore said the company thinks their customers feel young, cool and part of a wider society, but they're wrong."Make sure this mob don't get reward for view that many people don't share, for views that offend the eyes and the education of our community and which are wrong," she said.Social worker Barbara Crosser said the slogans were abhorrent in a society where one in three woman aged of 15 has been assaulted, one in five has been sexually assaulted and one in six have been threatened or sexually or physical assaulted by their partner."We need to stop the culture that supports rape and violence against women and Wicked Campers promotes these attitudes," Ms Crosser said.Social worker and mother Megan Hall said Wicked Campers was desensitising people to the sexualisation and abuse of woman."It is time to expose them for what they are ... these messages are not funny, they are not intelligent or witty," she said."They are hateful, sexist and promote a violent and objectifying culture that says women are possessions to be used by men at their will."Comment has been sought from Wicked Campers and the Queensland government.
Despite falling short of the world record for the most superheroes in one place at one time, Queanbeyan was awash with colourful costumes and characters on Saturday.More than 100 caped crusaders converged on the showground on Saturday for the Guinness world record attempt  - to have 1500 superheroes in the same place at one time - and to raise awareness for children's charity Capes 4 Kids.The charity aims to empower sick and hospitalised children by providing them with a handmade superhero cape. More than 3600 of the capes have been delivered to kids across the nation since the charity began in 2013.Iron Man, Spiderman and Batman were among the most popular superhero costumes at the showground, with other popular outfits including Wonder Woman, Flash and even the Hulk.Despite being just a few hundred superheroes short of the record, Queanbeyan resident and Capes 4 Kids founder Heather Foggett said she was pleased with the show of support."We've got superheroes all around us. We've got kids in every costume imaginable, having fun," Ms Foggett said."Queanbeyan has put on a great day for us and we're really appreciative of the community and wider community for supporting us."Leilah and Greg Ayton attended with their four children, to support families in need.Mum and Amelia, 7, both donned a Wonder Woman outfits, while dad and Nick, 6, arrived as Superman, Olivia, 2, turned brooding crime fighter as Batman and Penny, five months, sparkled as Superbaby."We just wanted to be able to help other people who aren't as lucky as what we are, to have four healthy kids," Leilah said."It's good to see so many parents dressed up with their kids."We were a bit nervous thinking are we going to be the only adults so it was nice to see so many people here and people from all walks of life having a good day."The event was also a fundraiser for Capes 4 Kids to raise money for postage of the capes, the biggest expense for the charity.
The Liberal Democrats are not fielding any candidates in a borough election despite 11 standing four years ago.One Lib Dem councillor was elected to Christchurch Borough Council in 2011, but he defected to the Conservative group.The council is made up of 22 Conservatives and two Independents.Lib Dem constituency candidate Andy Canning said the local party "wanted to concentrate on the general election campaign".Of the 69 candidates standing in the Christchurch borough election, across 11 wards, 24 are Conservatives, 20 are Labour, 16 are from the UK Independence Party (UKIP), six are from the Green Party, and three are Independents.A spokeswoman for the Christchurch Conservative group said her group had been getting very good support but added it was not for her to speculate about why the Lib Dems had not put any candidates forward.The Christchurch Labour group said the Lib Dems' share of the vote at the last local elections in 2011 was "significant".A spokesman said it would be "a very interesting fight here in Christchurch" with a "strong possibility" of Labour councillors being elected.Janet Dover, Lib Dem group leader at Dorset County Council, said she was "disappointed" but had not been involved in the recruitment process in Christchurch.The candidates for the Christchurch Parliamentary constituency are:
U.S. President Barack Obama (L) talks with his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro before the inauguration of the VII Summit of the Americas in Panama City April 10, 2015.U.S. President Barack Obama and his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro talk with an unidentified man before the inauguration of the VII Summit of the Americas in Panama City April 10, 2015.U.S. President Barack Obama (L) and his Cuban counterpart Raul Castro shake hands as U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon (R) looks on, before the inauguration of the VII Summit of the Americas in Panama City April 10, 2015.A photograph showed Obama and Castro, both wearing dark suits, chatting in a small group of leaders at the summit's opening ceremony. A White House official confirmed the two men shook hands and spoke briefly."This was an informal interaction and there was not a substantive conversation between the two leaders," the official said.Obama and Castro are expected to meet again on Saturday and talk about their efforts to restore full diplomatic relations and boost trade and travel between the two countries.Their rapprochement, first unveiled in a historic policy shift in December, is the central issue at the Summit of the Americas meeting in Panama."As we move towards the process of normalization, we'll have our differences government to government with Cuba on many issues. Just as we differ at times with other nations within the Americas, just as we differ with our closest allies," Obama said earlier on Friday.But the 53-year-old Obama, who was not even born when Fidel and Raul Castro swept to power in Cuba's 1959 revolution, also said the United States is no longer interested in trying to impose its will on Latin America."The days in which our agenda in this hemisphere so often presumed that the United States could meddle with impunity, those days are past," he said.Apart from a couple of brief, informal encounters, the leaders of the United States and Cuba have not had any significant meetings since the Castro brothers toppled U.S.-backed dictator Fulgencio Batista and then steered their Caribbean country into a close alliance with the Soviet Union.Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos hailed Obama's push to improve relations with Cuba, saying it was helping to heal a "blister" that was hurting the region.However, Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas said civic groups in Cuba have been sidelined from talks and appealed to Obama to support their push for more democracy."The Cuban government is showing no goodwill ... They don't want to make any kind of concessions," he told Reuters.Obama, who met with activists from across Latin America, including two Cuban dissidents, appears to be close to removing communist-run Cuba from a U.S. list of countries that it says sponsor terrorism.Its inclusion on the list brings a series of automatic U.S. sanctions and Cuba is insisting it be taken off as a condition of restoring diplomatic ties.Washington imposed trade sanctions on Cuba from 1960 and broke off diplomatic relations with Cuba in 1961, but the ensuing freeze did it no favors, said Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser."Our Cuba policy, instead of isolating Cuba, was isolating the United States in our own backyard," he noted.The two countries have maintained contact through interests sections in Havana and Washington since 1977, and in recent years they have increasingly cooperated on issues such as migration and drug trafficking.The State Department has now recommended that Cuba be taken off the terrorism list, a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said. Obama is expected to agree, although it is not clear whether he will announce it during the summit.Obama has already used his executive authority to ease some trade and travel restrictions, and is seeking to encourage nascent small businesses in Cuba by allowing more exports there.But only Congress, controlled by Republicans, can remove the overall U.S. economic embargo on the island. The rapprochement by Obama, a Democrat, has met some resistance in Washington and among some influential Cuban-Americans.Critics say Cuba should not be rewarded unless it changes its one-party political system.While Obama's policy has been widely praised around Latin America, this was tempered last month when his administration imposed sanctions on Venezuela, Cuba's closest ally and main benefactor.That controversy now hangs over the summit this weekend.Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro plans to present Obama with a petition signed by millions of people demanding that the sanctions be reversed. He is certain to receive support from Castro and other left-wing leaders in Latin America."It is no time for imperialism, threats, it is time for peace, cooperation, union, progress, prosperity," Maduro said on arrival in Panama.
Prosecco has soared in popularity with supermarket shoppers in Britain splashing out £181.8m on the Italian sparkling wine last year.Spending on prosecco overtook champagne for the first time, with £141.3m spent on champagne during 2014, according to the market researchers Kantar.The fizz particularly appeals to women and young people, as it is sweeter than champagne, according to one industry expert. The price is also appealing – prosecco sells for an average of £6.49 a bottle, while the average for champagne is £16.23, according to Kantar.Spending on prosecco last year was double that of 2013.“Despite making cutbacks, shoppers still want a little bit of luxury ,” said Toby Magill, head of beers, wine and spirits at IRI, a marketing company, commenting in The Grocer .The supermarket Asda reported its sales of prosecco shot up 41 per cent so far this year, compared with the same period last year. Over Easter, shoppers snapped up more than 700,000 bottles.• Italy's prosecco makers go to war against British pubs selling it on tapMarc Ambrose, Asda's champagne and sparkling wine buyer said: "By nature, prosecco hailing from Italy is far sweeter than the majority of champagne so we can see why it appeals to females and a younger audience plus its price point makes it easy to splash out on a few bottles when hosting a party.”Dror Nativ, a wine buyer at Marks & Spencer, said earlier this year that there was a new trend for enjoying prosecco as an everyday treat rather than solely on celebratory occasions."Our customers are enjoying prosecco midweek, at dinner parties with friends, or simply as a treat, and sales show no sign of slowing down," he said.Prosecco sales have grown rapidly in the past five years, but The Grocer reported that some champagne suppliers see this as an opportunity.“People come into the category through prosecco and then evolve into buying champagne as their interest in quality becomes more prominent,” said Paul Beavis, managing director of the champagne house Lanson.Video: Battle of the bubbles as champagne loses to prosecco
Rabat – Morocco and the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) signed on Thursday in Washington a memorandum of understanding under which the kingdom provides African countries with its “exemplary experience” and technical assistance in various productive sectors, Maghreb Arab Press (MAP) reported.The memorandum of understanding was signed by the Minister Delegate for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation Mbarka Bouaida and Deputy CEO of MCC, Nancy Lee, on the sidelines of the third session of the Morocco-U.S strategic dialogue.The three-year agreement aims at finding means of facilitating the sharing of the Morocco’s experiences with African countries and to promote private investment and serve as a model for South-South cooperation, the same source added.“Morocco has established historical, cultural and economic ties with several African countries where MCC is engaged,” MCC announced in a statement.“The technical capabilities, the exemplary experience and the skills of the Kingdom in various productive sectors allow it to bring valuable expertise to the development efforts supported by MMC funds.”Join the Conversation.

Durban - Winter might be on its way, but the temperature over the South Coast nudist beach is rising again.The lobby opposed to nudism being permitted on Mpenjati Beach, near Trafalgar, is now taking its case to the public protector.“We believe there have been numerous legislative violations,” Reverend Mike Effanga, chairman of the Concerned Citizens of the Hibiscus Coast Municipality, said.Before the launch of the nudist beach last week, he went to Mpenjati with the police to inform nudists that no municipal legislation had changed in their favour.This prompted them to put their clothes back on, but they took them off again upon hearing from the municipality that the nudist beach had been given the green light.Serge Pavlovic, chairman of the South African National Naturists’ Association, scoffed at the reverend’s threat, saying he was sure the public protector “would have more important things to deal with”.He accused Effanga of “trying whatever he can to keep the emotions going”.Effanga said: “The public protector needs to investigate the suspicious behaviour that might have motivated illegalities”.“We are exploring all legal options to correct the imbalance.”The municipality could not be reached for comment.

He was reportedly with his mother, brothers and sisters near Flaine, a resort in the Haute-Savoie region, when he disappeared on Friday.Local newspaper Le Dauphiné Libéré reported that an emergency rescue operation to find him lasted two hours and the child was eventually spotted by a helicopter, lying at the foot of a cliff.Rescue workers reached the boy but were unable to save him.A spokesperson for the emergency services told the AFP news agency that he went off piste after asking his mother if he could make the final descent of the day alone.“He hit a rocky outcrop, then fell 50 to 100 metres (160 to 320 feet),” he added.An investigation has been launched and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was aware of the death."We can confirm the death of a British national in Flaine, France, on 10 April," a spokesperson said."We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time."
The Kardashians have been causing a storm since they landed in their ancestral homeland Armenia earlier this week.Kim and Khloe, who say that the trip has been a longtime dream, have even met the country’s Prime Minister.But their visit took a sombre turn yesterday as the duo visited the Armenian Genocide Memorial.The famous sisters, who looked as glamorous as ever in figure-hugging playsuits, were pictured laying flowers at the site in Yerevan, which is dedicated to the estimated 1.5 million Armenians who were executed by the Ottoman Turks between 1915 and 1923.They were joined by their cousins Kourtni and Kara (yes, they have ‘K’ names too).Kim husband’s Kanye West and her daughter North are also in the country and the clan have been mobbed by fans at every turn.MORE: Kim Kardashian wants you to know that she really cares about genocide as she meets with Armenian PMMORE: ‘Kardashians can’t park here!’ Family is BANNED from parts of Hollywood
A plate of sausage rolls may have landed a Ukip parliamentary candidate in hot water with the police.Electoral Commission rules state that a person is ‘guilty of treating if either before, during or after an election they directly or indirectly give or provide any food, drink, entertainment or provision to corruptly influence any voter to vote or refrain from voting’.They don’t seem that dangerous but the pasty treats could lead officers to question Kim Rose, who is standing in Southampton Itchen, in Hampshire.It is alleged he tried to woo voters by handing out sausage rolls at a party event attended by snooker legend Jimmy White, but he claims he just laid on refreshments for the guests.MORE: Devoted husband cooks his wife a years worth of dinners to eat while he’s stationed away from homeHampshire Constabulary has since received a report of ‘treating’ by the prospective parliamentary candidate, and he said he has been told to report to police over the claims.‘It was a fantastic day.

Maxine Minniver could be set to meet a sticky end in dramatic Hollyoaks scenes which have recently been filmed on location.Brave actress Nikki Sanderson was spotted standing on the edge of a tower, suggesting that Maxine could be set for a horrific fall. While Nikki was harnessed up to film the scenes, it still looks pretty scary from where we’re standing and the episodes in question will leave viewers just as much on edge as poor Maxine.After a troubled few years, Maxine looks set to be driven to desperate measures, but is she really going to end it all?It’s not looking good for the popular character as she seems to be threatening to jump but what has finally been the last straw?Maxine is currently unaware that the father of her child, Patrick, is suffering from motor neurone disease. The condition is set to be Patrick’s exit story although it remains to be confirmed whether Maxine’s tower drama is linked to this plot twist.The custody battle for Minnie continues to rage on, however, and is tipped for some dramatic developments.Either way, there are guaranteed to be gripping scenes ahead for Maxine.We just hope they won’t be her last ever scenes like these pictures worryingly imply.MORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Zoe Lucker joins as part of new McQueen child sex shockerMORE: Hollyoaks spoilers: Lindsey Butterfield and Freddie Roscoe’s wedding to be destroyed by killer shooting

Orlaith Meenan, who has spent the last year employed as a Venue & Event Sales Executive at the Stadium of Light, has agreed terms; passed the medical and she will kick-off her career next month at Old Trafford as the “Red Devils” new Business Development Executive.In fact, next month will prove to be a ‘double whammy’ for the delighted daughter of Danny and Sharon Meenan, from Derry’s Kylemore Park, as she will also be celebrating her 26th birthday!Educated at St. Cecilia’s College before graduating from the University of Ulster at Coleraine with a degree in Leisure Events & Cultural Management, Orlaith has experienced something of a rollercoaster ride over the past four years.Struggling to find a job at home, she opted to take the “voluntary” route as she attempted to follow her dreams.A six months sojourn in Derry City Council’s Tourism Department was followed by a stint, again in a voluntary capacity, working for the Football Association of Ireland and those two experiences were to prove highly significant in later years. “I struggled to get employment after graduating and rather than hang around I took on a few voluntary roles, working at Derry City Council and assisting the FAI at home matches and later helping out at two annual general meetings, one in Co. Clare and the other in Co. Donegal,” declared Orla.“I did not receive any payment but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and given that my daddy helped me as he is employed by the Council, it all worked out well for me in the end,” she laughed.Having applied and got accepted to join a two years “Graduate Programme” with Tourism Ireland, Orlaith was based in Coleraine for one year spending the second year in the “Big Apple” and, suddenly, her life began to take shape.“As my year in New York was coming to an end I faced the prospect of coming home with no job. I really enjoyed my time with the F.A.I. and attempted to get a placement year with a few football clubs in England, but those approaches didn’t work out.“I was then informed that Sunderland were seeking people to work for them. I got the details, made an application and I was then interviewed by telephone.“I did okay with that and then agreed to be interviewed again, this time by ‘Skype’ from New York and I was offered the job as a Venue & Events Sales Executive - so I was back in football again!”Working at the Stadium of Light over the past year has been really good for Orlaith having made many friends, but while her boyfriend resided in Manchester, the plan was always to try and move closer to him.“While at Sunderland, I recently learned that Manchester United were seeking a Business Executive and while I honestly didn’t expect anything to come of it, I felt it was important to apply, if only to express an interest.“A few days later I received a telephone call from the club, offering me an interview the following week which I was delighted to attend at Old Trafford.“To be shown around the stadium was fantastic. I was amazed at the Stadium of Light when I first saw it and I always felt it was massive, given the corporate facilities, but Old Trafford was something else.“I was absolutely stunned at the facilities. It was mesmerising, it really was.“I felt I did a good first interview when there and I liked the people who were dealing with me. I was then called back, I think the candidates had been whittled down to three or four and I was absolutely astounded to have been offered the job,” declared the Derry lass.“It was amazing. My family was delighted, I was delighted and, as far as I’m aware, my boyfriend was also delighted,” she laughed.However, before moving to the North-West, she must work out her notice of one month at the Stadium of Light before officially taking up her new post.“Obviously, I’ve been told what the job entails and it’s certainly not unlike what I had been doing at Sunderland. However, as Manchester United is considered a world wide brand, the club conducts so much business off the football pitch.“As a Business Development Executive, my main responsibility is to generate and attract business to Old Trafford Stadium. From business such as attracting conferences, special functions and work shops, down to the staging of weddings etc., indeed anything that can be accommodated inside the stadium.“At Sunderland, concerts played a big part in my role but I’m not sure if Old Trafford is actually used to stage concerts.”Orlaith explained that multi-national companies and organisations, based in the UK and abroad, constantly hold conferences in London and she understood that Manchester United appears to be keen to break into that particular market.“Big firms from Germany and France have used fashionable football stadiums for their conferences in London and with Old Trafford being in a position to facilitate such demands, it comes as no surprise that the club is keen to attract that type of business,” she concluded.to the experience, Orlaith Meenan’s attitude to take on those voluntary roles a few years ago appears to have paid handsome dividends.After all, a year working in New York for Irish Tourism followed by an interesting position with a Premiership football club and then to take up a job with one of the biggest brands in the world of professional football has certainly been a rollercoaster ride with a difference.“I’m really excited about the future and while I felt that working in a voluntary capacity with Derry City Council and the Football Association of Ireland would sit well in my C.V., I really didn’t expect that voluntary work to play such an important role in my life,” she concluded.Indeed, the Kylemore Park lass may not have had that many approaches from the local footballing fraternity to visit her at Sunderland - after all she arrived after James McClean had left for Wigan - but she can be assured that she will emerge an instantly popular young lady by the legions of United fans both inside and outside her family circle.
Ten years ago she was the most reviled woman in Britain.Such was the emotional power of Prince Charles’s wronged wife Diana that it was alleged bread rolls were hurled at his hated mistress Camilla in the walkways of Sainsbury’s by furious Diana worshippers.It all seems a long time ago now and it’s hard to imagine the furore caused by the Prince taking a mistress, something of a custom dating back several centuries after all.Recently it has been revealed that Diana wept during the rehearsal for her marriage and now it emerges that Camilla was so worried about her public reception that she too had to be gently cajoled out of bed on that morning in 2005 and into the Guildhall for the civil ceremony.Fortunately she had no cause to be alarmed after all. Apart from the odd protestor there was nothing but the usual crowds of well-wishers demonstrating once again that the power of royalty transcends almost all other emotions.My own recollection is that the majority of the British public were bored with the whole saga and simply glad that a middle-aged couple who had endured so much opprobium, but who obviously adored one another, should be allowed to tie the knot with the minimum of fuss.There was an amusingly contemptuous remark from a commentator that the Prince had effectively “got married in the local town hall” – given his admitted adultery there was no church service – but that was about it. Diana’s power had inevitably faded and it seemed the public sensed that Charles, in an odd echo of his Uncle David and Wallis Simpson, that he could never be truly happy without Camilla at his side. Even the arguments about whether she could ever become Queen one day have disappeared thanks to her unobtrusive style. She so obviously has little interest in titles that a clamour may have to be got up for her to accept it when the time comes.
A 23-year-old woman has died after being struck by a vehicle on the outskirts of Cookstown, County Tyrone.Jayne Burnside was walking along Gortagammon Road at Tullyhogue, at about 01:00 BST on Saturday when she was knocked down.She was from Cookstown.Police have appealed for anyone who witnessed the incident to contact them.
A parrot with the intelligence of a five-year-old has left home to go to college.Chico the clever-clogs African grey, escaped from his house in Dundee more than a week ago.He was later spotted in the grounds of Dundee and Angus College and is still thought to be there.His owner, Paul Drummond, has camped out for up to 11 hours in the grounds of the Gardyne Road campus, hoping to find him.But it seems that Chico is determined to stay at large.Paul, of Strips of Craigie Place, said: “Chico flew away from my back garden last Tuesday.“I’d built him an aviary so that he could spend time outside on sunny days.“I got him in it and went in to put in his stand, leaving the door open by about 10 to 12 inches. That’s when he got away — it was my fault. I was gutted.“An African grey has been spotted at the college campus and I took a day off work specially to look for him.“I went there with his cage and stayed for 11 hours, but didn’t see him at all.”Paul, a painter and decorator, and his wife Deborah bought Chico about three months ago.The one-year-old parrot can already say a few words and is described as being very friendly around people.Paul added: “We’re living in hope that someone will spot Chico somewhere. He might not even be at the college anymore.”A Dundee and Angus College spokeswoman said: “The owner came to report it to one of our caretakers and we posted it on our online portal in case anyone sees him.”If you spot Chico, contact Paul on 01382 459889 or 07739 571117.
First, The Daily Show’s house Muslim scripted The Qu’osby Show, but...oops! So Aasif Mandvi’s new series evokes an even more classic sitcom.The Daily Show’s Aasif Mandvi has done many things in his career. He’s The Daily Show’s Senior Muslim correspondent, he recently wrote a book, “No Land’s Man,” and, of course, he has played a range of brown characters in movies, from doctors to terrorist number two (and number three.)But now Mandvi is doing something far different.  And frankly it’s not something he had to do; nor is it something that will likely help his career. He has co-created and co-starred in a new web series that’s intended to use comedy to counter anti-Muslim bigotry.  The four-episode series, “Halal in the Family,” was launched this week and raises issues about Muslims that we rarely see addressed through comedy.The series was co-created along with Daily Show producer Miles Kahn and co-stars Sakina Jaffrey  (Linda Vasquez, President Walker’s chief of staff on House of Cards) and features cameos from The Daily Show’s Samantha Bee and the lead MC of the hip-hop group The Roots, Tariq “Black Thought” Trotter, who actually is Muslim. (That’s right, Muslims are little by little taking over the entertainment field.)I chatted with my longtime friend Mandvi about the issues raised in the series from President Obama being a Muslim to scaring white people to why the Bill Cosby sex scandal matters to this series.Dean Obeidallah: This entire project was inspired by an unlikely source: Katie Couric.  Is Katie Couric possibly a stealth Muslim?Aasif Mandvi: Katie Couric was actually the inspiration for the concept of a Muslim sitcom. A few years ago she commented that Muslims needed their own version of The Cosby Show in order to break down stereotypes about Muslims.  On The Daily Show we thought, why not create an episode of a Muslim Cosby show?  So I worked with producer Miles Kahn to shoot a parody of The Cosby show called The Qu’osby Show that featured a Muslim family. We then showed this pilot to a group of conservative Americans, but many didn’t find it believable. Not because the family wasn’t Muslim enough, but because there were no terrorists in the family. It was funny to hear that but also made it clear that for some, Muslim and terrorism are synonymous.DO:   So flash-forward a few years later, and you decide to turn the one-episode Cosby show parody into a series.  You raise money, write the scripts and shoot the episodes.  But only a few months before its release, the Bill Cosby sex scandal broke.  I can only imagine how much that caused a headache for the project.AM: Well, we were literally a few days from launching a crowd-funding campaign to raise $40,000 we needed to finish editing the project. We had all this material written up about The Qu’osby Show being a parody of The Cosby show to entice people to donate. And then all of sudden there was like over 30 women stating Cosby sexually assaulted them, so we knew that if used the Cosby parody idea it would give out the wrong impression of what the show was about. So that was what led us to change the name to Halal in the Family, which is inspired by the famous 1970s sitcom All in the Family.DO: Are you worried that one of the actors from All in the Family might get involved in a scandal causing you more problems– maybe Rob Reiner?  Actually my bet would be Sally Struthers.AM: We are not really that worried about that scenario. Although when the Cosby scandal was first breaking, since we had put so much money and work into this, I almost felt like we were rooting for Cosby – not because we didn’t believe the women, just because we were like, our Qu’osby show idea is screwed!DO: You recently spoke to the man who created All in the Family, Norman Lear.  He also created such iconic TV shows as Maude and The Jeffersons. What did he think of the web series?AM: He liked it so much he actually donated some money to help us produce it. To him, this was exactly the right way to raise hot button issues because that is what he did with his shows in the 1970s and ’80s.DO: In the series, you mention that President Obama is a Muslim.  Can you tell us definitively is Obama a Muslim?AM: He absolutely is. We Muslims know it. It’s in our Muslim newsletter. Actually in the series we make a joke about Obama being a Muslim to poke fun at those who love to say Obama is a Muslim.DO: I know you are kidding, but some on the right will, of course, claim you just revealed a Muslim secret.  By the way how Muslim are you on a range of say from secular to ISIS?AM: Well, I wear lamb-scented cologne, so what does that tell you?  Actually I’m more culturally Muslim than religiously but being Muslim is an important part of my identity.  I wanted to make this project because as Muslim, I feel it’s important to counter any form of bigotry, be it anti-Semitism, homophobia, racism, etc. These forms of hate share a common denominator of misinformation and intentional fear mongering.DO: In this series you raise some serious issues that I have not seen discussed in a comedic way before.  I’m talking actually explaining what the term “sharia law” means to even the idea that the FBI is planting informants in our community and causing distrust among American Muslims because we don’t know if the new Muslim who just joined the community is actually a Muslim or an FBI informant. How important was it to address these issues?AM: The episodes are short but the hope is that by raising those issues, as well as online bullying of Muslims, it will start a conversation about the issue. It’s not that these episodes will end anti-Muslim bigotry or resolve these issues, but comedy can reach many more people than, say, a serious lecture on the topic.  And comedy might just be the access point to reach people who want to be entertained and also learn something.DO:  I know you had to struggle to raise money to produce this. Ironically if you were demonizing Muslims, you could likely raise money easier.  In New York City one of the big Muslim haters raised $100,000 for ads on subways and buses to demonize Muslims. Do you think you will have the funds to make more episodes of this series?AM: What’s great is that people are more excited about this web series than we ever expected. So we now have more people interested in funding additional episodes. Maybe we will see longer format, possibly even a TV show.  If people invited Muslims into their home every week by way of a TV show would go a long way to making people feel comfortable with Muslims and countering misconceptions about who we are.  Plus, of course, that will make it easier for us to impose sharia law across America.
The Rivers State Chief of Staff, Chief Tony Okocha, has alleged few hours ago that the Olanada Registration Area Centre in Obio/Akpor Local Government Area of Rivers State has been raided by some group of policemen.He said that some of the original materials for the governorship and State House of Assembly elections were taken away from the registration centre when the policemen allegedly invaded the area in the early hour of Saturday. He alleged further that the original election materials were replaced with cloned ones.
“FOURTH time lucky”: this will surely be the phrase that the supporters of General Muhammadu Buhari will use when describing the amazing victory he has just scored against President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria?You see, in Nigeria (more than in most countries) it is not possible to win an election without money. And, usually, no-one has more of it than a candidate who is campaigning from a position of incumbency.Small and not-so-small favours done to companies and individuals bring in financial dividends. New contributors are also not lacking from the ranks of those who have an eye on securing future favours. So the “war chest” that had been accumulated through the bribes, commissions and outright “gifts” during the days of power multiply on geometric proportions.It takes a certain amount of mettle for an individual to be able to carry on fighting such a system once every four years, for four consecutive 4-year periods. Especially where, as in Buhari’s case, the last attempt (2011), resulted in one garnering only 32% of the vote, to the 59% obtained by the incumbent, the same Goodluck Jonathan one was facing in 2015. And – worse – when one knew that in 2011, one’s support had consisted almost entirely of votes based on regional-cum-ethnic loyalties. (Buhari’s 2011 support was made up of 97% of the votes cast in Northern Nigeria.)But whereas such a formidable set of statistics and circumstances might have discouraged another individual with a similar background from sticking to the constitutional path to power, and tempted him to resort, once again, to a “military solution” (Buhari once staged a coup, in December 1983, against the civilian government of President Shehu Shagari ) Buhari continued to prefer the electoral route.As he did this, Buhari was mocked for being “too old” – at 72 years of age. More damaging was a charge that he had now become the “tool” of politicians from Southern Nigeria, some of whom were every bit as corrupt as the Jonathan administration that he, Buhari, had been railing against.However, Buhari himself saw his new situation in terms familiar with military strategy: namely, that he had “regrouped” his human resources, abandoned moribund tactics, and acquired new allies.The Nigerian electorate bought into the idea that Muhammadu Buhari had “reinvented” himself. So, even when President Jonathan’s People’s Democratic Party (PDP) postponed the election for some weeks in order (some suspected) to “perfect” the rigging machinery it had secretly put in place, it was Buhari who eventually obtained a majority of the votes cast.Buhari beat Jonathan by 2.5 million votes in the presidential election, and, in the process, also satisfied the constitutional requirement that he should obtain 25 percent of the votes in two-thirds of 36 states. That Buhari achieved all this at one go was astonishing. President Jonathan recognised this when, in a noble gesture, he telephoned Buhari to concede victory to him.Buhari will assume office in May 2015. His major tasks will include:But all that was a good 32 years ago, during which time a baby that was born could have grown up and had babies of its own. If such a person were told about Buhari’s “political baggage”, he/she would probably ask with unfeigned astonishment: “Baggage? What baggage?”Who are those of a later generation to question a person of this new era, to whom the future of Nigeria unquestionably belongs more than anyone else? By Cameron Duodu

A light plane has crashed in South Australia's mid-north after hitting powerlines.The single-engine plane came down in Washpool, approximately 85km east of Port Pirie, just after 5.30pm, police say.It is unknown if the single occupant sustained injury. "It looked serious," a police spokesperson said. Emergency crews are at the scene.
World champion Lewis Hamilton roared to pole position in Saturday's qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, just pipping Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg.Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel, who stunned the Silver Arrows to win in Malaysia two weeks ago, will start from third on the grid for Sunday's race alongside the Williams of Felipe Massa.Australia's Daniel Ricciardo was seventh fastest in his Red Bull.Hamilton, who won in Shanghai for the third time last year, clocked the quickest time of one minute, 35.782 seconds to maintain his perfect qualifying record in the season's first three races.Rosberg lapped just four hundredths slower than the Briton and when informed he had narrowly missed out on pole, yelled over the radio: "Oh come on, guys!"The German then shook hands with countryman Vettel but blanked Hamilton as the top three posed for pitlane photographs.Hamilton has dominated all weekend, his only real discomfort coming from an overheating cockpit on Saturday, but Rosberg's pace should make for an absorbing battle in China.Vettel clocked 1:36.687 ahead of Massa and the second Williams of Valtteri Bottas as Ferrari failed to get both cars on the second row, Kimi Raikkonen only sixth fastest in smoggy conditions.Ricciardo and Romain Grosjean's Lotus were next and the Saubers of Felipe Nasr and Marcus Ericsson rounded out the top 10.However, there was more disappointment for McLaren as Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso languished back on the ninth row.Alonso, who ground to a halt in the morning's practice with smoke coming from his car, stormed past mechanics and into the garage after his latest setback while McLaren boss Ron Dennis stared grimly at his pit screen.Both Button and Alonso, suffering wretched fortune on his return to McLaren from Ferrari, failed to finish in Sepang to leave them without a single point in two races.Mercedes racked up 16 victories in 19 races last year and again pulverised their rivals in this season's opener in Australia, before Vettel stopped the rot in Sepang to end Ferrari's 34-race drought.

Adelaide has maintained its hold on top spot of the AFL ladder with a rollicking 27-point win over Collingwood at Docklands.For the second week in a row, the Crows were irrepressible and gave every indication they would make a prompt return to finals under new coach Phil Walsh.The only sour point for the visitors was a nasty concussion to Brodie Smith, whose head collided with Travis Varcoe's leg in a fourth-quarter tackle.The Crows' inaccuracy and four meaningless late goals to the Magpies were the only factors that stopped the margin blowing out.From the outset of the 12.18 (90) to 9.9 (63) triumph, the visitors overwhelmed and outclassed their opposition.They hunted in numbers, stuck tackles, hit packs with reckless abandon and created turnovers all over the park with relentless pressure.The Crows seemed to always have a glut of options with the ball in hand due to their restless running and confidence to play on and take the game on.As was the case against North Melbourne in round one, Smith, Patrick Dangerfield, Rory Sloane and Richard Douglas were some of Adelaide's prime movers.Sloane and Dangerfield tallied 30 possessions each, while Dangerfield finished with two goals and eight clearances.Last week, skipper Taylor Walker booted six goals and was best on ground.This time around, the Crows had already built a 32-point lead in the second term when Walker kicked the first of his two goals.Collingwood's plight was not helped by a hamstring injury to Ben Sinclair, with substitute Paul Seedsman called into action shortly before quarter-time.At times, it looked like a training drill but, before that, both sides started scrappily and the first goal did not come until the 13th minute.It was worth the wait.Eddie Betts plucked the ball off Alan Toovey, found space near the boundary line and converted from an acute angle.The Magpies trailed by 22 points at the first break.Never before had the Crows held Collingwood goalless in an opening term.Jarryd Blair kicked the opening goal of the second quarter to reduce the gap to 19 points.The hosts never managed to get closer or looked like getting close.The Crows next face Melbourne and the Western Bulldogs and are shaping up well to be 4-0 when they face Port Adelaide in round five.Captain Scott Pendlebury was a standout for the hosts with 32 touches, while fourth-gamer Adam Oxley impressed on the half-back flank.
New York: A serial New York bride has been busted after juggling eight husbands at once and getting hitched six times in one year, prosecutors say.Liana Barrientos, 39, pleaded not guilty in a Bronx court on Friday to charges of fraud.Prosecutors say she lied on the licence for her most recent wedding in 2010 and faces four years in jail if convicted.New York state records show she has been married 10 times since 1999 and that 2002 was a particularly busy year - in which Barrientos walked down the aisle six times in different towns.Prosecutors did not specify the reason for her marriage binge but all her husbands came from overseas, including Egypt, Pakistan and Mali, and immigration officials have been involved in the case.Six of her husbands used Barrientos to apply for permanent residency in the United States, including husband number six, Rashid Rajput, who in 2006 was deported home to Pakistan following a terrorism investigation, prosecutors said.Still in her mid-20s, court papers show that Barrientos celebrated Valentine's Day 2002 by getting married a fourth time, seemingly without a single divorce.Just two weeks later, she married husband number five. Two weeks later, it was the turn of husband number six.She then closed out the summer of 2002 with another three weddings in May, July and August, before calling it a halt for eight years.It was after she applied to marry her most recent husband, Salle Keita, on March 4, 2010 that the authorities caught up with her.When she applied for the marriage licence, Barrientos stated she had never been married before, court papers show.Prosecutors say she is currently married to four people and was once married to eight men at the same time.
Sir Ian McKellen has just turned what is set to be an amazing film into a movie of epic proportions.The legendary thespian has been cast alongside Emma Watson and Dan Stevens in the live-action remake of Beauty And The Beast. Sir Ian, famous for roles in The Lord Of The Rings and X Men, is to play the Beast’s servant Cogsworth.Cogsworth was transformed into a clock by the curse and was characteristically fussy and sarcastic. And we think Sir Ian is the perfect actor to portray him.The adaptation is believed to be billed for a 2017 release but the hype is already well underway due to the stellar cast involved.Disney also recently announced live-action remakes of Mulan, Dumbo and Pinocchio.Now, if they can just find Sir Ian a role in each of those, we’d be even happier. Toy maker Geppetto has McKellen written all over him.MORE: 13 emotions everyone goes through when watching a Disney movieMORE: The Lion King fact that will blow your mind: what was Scar’s real name in the Disney classic?
Organ music wafted out from the vaulted choir of Dunblane Cathedral, where the biggest match of ­Scottish tennis ace Andy Murray’s career was set to take place this afternoon.The bellringers could also be heard, their rich tones peeling out from the 11th-century bell tower on the medieval cathedral overlooking the River Allan where the Wimbledon and Olympic champion was to wed his sweetheart of nine years, painter Kim Sears.The streets and shopfronts in the main streets were strung with floral bunting and cream rosettes and ribbons.Good luck messages were posted in every second window and large “Congratulations” signs have been erected at roundabouts leading into the picturesque town.William Lavery, a workman from Dundee, spruced up the gold postbox in Dunblane High Street, a tribute to the star’s 2012 Olympic victory, with a fresh coat of paint, while a further 150 traditional red boxes in the neighbourhood were cleaned up for the big day.He said: “That’s it – just another three to go and that will be them all done.”According to Murray, his bride-to-be has taken charge of most elements of their big day.Miss Sears, who specialises in animal portraits, has gone for a “natural” theme, with echoes of that chosen by Prince William and Kate Middleton for their nuptials.There are 22 elegant saplings lining the aisle down which she will take her final steps as a single woman.The trees will be hung with simple glass baubles containing candles ahead of the ceremony, which will be witnessed by just close friends and family.No-one was spilling any details, but it is believed minister Colin Renwick would perform the marriage. Guests would go on to a private reception at Murray’s own luxury Cromlix Hotel, just three miles up the road.Murray, who was best man for his brother Jamie’s wedding, which took place there last year, has returned the favour by inviting Jamie to be one of his three best men. The other two are close friend and tennis player Ross Hutchins and former training partner Carlos Mier.A local jeweller was unable to confirm whether he had been commissioned to make any rings for a marriage taking place on Saturday. However, he said the whole community was “delighted” the tennis champion, who studied at Dunblane High School and learned his craft at the local tennis club, had chosen to get married in his home town.
After a heavy night of drinking, your immune system is bound to be weaker.This is because your body is under oxidative stress - a process that can also happen after smoking, breathing in pollution and even sunbathing.Now, for the first time, researchers have shown that higher doses of vitamin E, found in foods such as kale and almonds, can mitigate the stress on immune cells.Whenever a virus or pathogen enters our bodies, a certain class of immune cells - the T cells0 jump into action, spreading rapidly.One sub-class of these cells, the CD8+ T cells, eliminate the virus by killing cells it has infected. Other T cells, known as CD4+ T cells, coordinate the immune response to all kinds of pathogens.But a week can pass before these T cells start to take their toll on a virus.And with cells dividing every eight to twelve hours, it takes a few days to gather a strike force of cells in the hundreds of thousands: enough to overwhelm the infection.But this immune response does not work if significant oxidative stress is damaging the T cells and depriving the body of the tools it needs to repair them, according to a new study.If the immune cells lack repair enzyme Gpx4, the T cells die off as they divide, which means the immune system becomes weak and the infection can be chronic.This is the enzyme responsible for repairing oxidative damage to the cell membrane.When testing mice whose immune cells lacked the repair enzyme, researchers led by Manfred Kopf, a professor at ETH Zurich, were able to save the immune cells by mixing a high dose of vitamin E into the animals' food.That was enough antioxidant to protect the T cells' cell membranes from damage, so they could multiply and successfully fend off the viral infection.At 500 milligrams per kilogram of mouse feed, this quantity of vitamin E was ten times higher than was present in their normal food.'The benefit of vitamin tablets is a controversial topic,' says Kopf. With little scientific evidence as yet making a strong case for vitamin supplements, he felt their study was all the more interesting because it proved the effectiveness of vitamin E.'Our work shows that even a genetic defect in a major part of a cell's antioxidative machinery can be compensated for by delivering a high dose of vitamin E. That is new and surprising.'What Kopf isn't yet sure of is what impact the results of their study will have on human health.He claims that people with a normal level of health and a balanced diet shouldn't need vitamin supplements.But he added a supplement of vitamin E or other liposoluble antioxidants could well make sense in the event of oxidative stress, which can arise in everyday situations such as an infection or exposure to sunlight.
The cabinet has approved three new inter-city motorways with a combined distance of 324 kilometres to make travel faster and easier, especially to the Northeast.The projects have an estimated cost of 160 billion baht.The three routes will run from Bang Pa-in in Ayutthaya via Saraburi to Nakhon Ratchasima, a distance of 196 kilometres; from Bang Yai via Ban Pong to Kanchanaburi (96km) and from Pattaya to Map Ta Phut (32km).Maj Gen Sansern Kaewkamnerd, the deputy government spokesman, said the Bang Pa-in-Nakhon Ratchasima route would relieve heavy congestion on the Mitrapharp Highway on weekends and holidays. The new motorway, to be completed in three years at a cost of 84.6 billion baht, would run parallel to the highway.Tailbacks on the Mitrapharp Highway can stretch as far as 30 kilometres on the hilly section in Thap Kwang sub-district of Kaeng Khoi district in Saraburi, he said.The Bang Yai-Ban Pong-Kanchanaburi motorway is aimed at improving links to the western region. Its cost is estimated at 55.6 billion baht and completion is expected in three years.The Pattaya-Map Ta Phut motorway is designed to facilitate transport for industries and tourism in the East. Its cost is estimated at 20.2 billion baht and construction will take about 30 months.
Quetta, Pakistan - Gunmen in Pakistan killed 20 labourers as they slept early on Saturday, a government official said, in what appeared to be the latest violence by separatist rebels battling for control of resources in gas- and mineral-rich Baluchistan province.Rebels have been fighting a low-intensity insurgency in the province for decades, demanding an end to what they see as the exploitation of their resources by people from other parts of Pakistan.The workers killed at a construction site 15km from the town of Turbat were mostly from outside Baluchistan which suggested the Baluch rebels were responsible, said provincial interior minister Akbar Hussain Durrani.“All were sleeping in their camp when they were targeted,” he said.Three wounded survivors said the gunmen opened fire on the sleeping men with automatic weapons, then escaped on motorcycles, he said.There was no claim of responsibility.The separatists frequently kidnap and kill civilians from other parts of the country and also attack gas facilities, infrastructure and security posts.Baluchistan, which borders Afghanistan and Iran is Pakistan's poorest and most thinly populated province.Human rights groups say the security agencies often arrest ethnic Baluch, torture them and dump their bodies in a policy that has become known as “Kill and Dump.”Some families say that children as young as 11 have been arrested and their bodies later found in shallow graves.Baluchistan is also home to Taliban insurgents, drug smugglers, kidnapping rings, sectarian militants, and government-backed paramilitary death squads.
The Protea Magistrate's Court in Soweto heard this as the trial of the teacher on two counts of rape and one of attempted murder continued on Friday.The teacher allegedly raped the one boy, then aged 10, at the school in November 2013.The teacher was also charged with attempted murder for allegedly knowingly exposing the boy to the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV).The boy had previously told the court that the teacher made him stay after school as punishment for damaging a book. The boy said the teacher gave him a choice between rape and a phone call to his mother but proceeded to rape him before the boy could make a choice.Testifying in his own defence on Friday, the teacher said he has known for the past eight years that he is HIV positive.He denied raping the two boys.He is also accused of raping another boy, then nine years old, in a bathroom at Maponya Mall in 2013 after offering the boy a lift home after soccer practice.The teacher said the mother of the boy allegedly raped at school was his “secret lover” and said he and the boy's mother had sex “several times” prior to his arrest. He said he had declared his love for her after he met her in the school corridor one day.“I had been separated from my wife. While we were still estranged, the boy's mother came into the picture. When my wife and I reconciled, that's when my relationship with the boy's mother soured,” the teacher said.Despite that, they continued to have sex up until the week before his arrest, he said.He said their trysts, which started in 2013, would often take place in his car.Prosecutor Carina Coetzee accused the teacher of lying because he never had an affair with the boy's mother.Outside court, the boy's mother said her son received anti-HIV treatment after the alleged rape and tested negative for HIV.The trial continues later this month.
The Stanley Cup playoffs return to Winnipeg this spring, a long absence that has clearly made the heart grow fonder.Just observe the mayhem after the berth was clinched on Thursday night -- the combination of a Jets' white-knuckle shootout loss of 1-0 in Colorado combined about five minutes later with a favourable result in Calgary, a 3-1 Flames win that extinguished the defending Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.Absences will do that. Hockey fans in particular always seem to long for what they don't have.In Winnipeg, fans of the Jets endured 15 dark years for games of any kind after their franchise was moved to Phoenix in 1996.The NHL approved a transfer of the Atlanta Thrashers to the Manitoba capital in 2011, but that came with a four-year drought of playoff action.Three more springs were tacked onto that skid while the new proprietors of the franchise re-tooled and re-engineered the organization.Game 82 of the season matters not to the Jets today, other than being a pressure-free opportunity for the team's fans to salute the consistency and preparation that has earned 97 points in 81 games in the NHL's toughest division.Well, it's into the fire of the post-season games sometime next week.Winnipeg's history is hardly glorious in this category. Even one of the city's outstanding traditions, the playoff whiteout that began in 1987, has been spectacularly ineffective when it comes to Stanley Cup tournament results, as Winnipeg-based teams have lost six series in a row and 11 out of 13 overall.Nonetheless, it's been a while and the pure enjoyment of its return is a priority. Plus, keeping in mind how most folks felt in 2011, the present is always just a little sweeter when you know the history.St. Louis defeated Winnipeg 3-1 in the first round.Getting into the playoffs as the second team (80 points, 80 games) in the Norris Division -- after a significant re-alignment -- was a huge step for the Jets. They had come into the league in 1979, and in the Smythe Division for two years had 51 points and then an awful 32, a total that paved the way to No. 1 pick Dale Hawerchuk. Hawerchuk led the Jets in scoring in the four playoff games in 1982, 1-7-8 as the Jets won Game 2 at home, but were otherwise beat down in St. Louis and goalie Mike Liut, 6-3 and 8-2 in Games 3 and 4.Edmonton swept Winnipeg 3-0 in the first round.Scores of 6-3, 4-3 and 4-3, with only Game 3 in Winnipeg, were the start of Edmonton's NHL domination over the Jets. The Jets qualified with just 74 points, back in the Smythe because Colorado dropped out of the NHL and Smythe and a rebalance was needed. But not even the presence of legendary defenceman Serge Savard could help. Wayne Gretzky won the scoring title that year with 196 points. The Oilers were swept in the Cup final by the Islanders.Edmonton swept Winnipeg 3-0 in the first round.Repeat. Edmonton won 9-2, 5-4 and 4-1, with Game 2 decided in overtime. It was kind of the same old story, the Jets were a sad fourth in the Smythe and the Oilers had improved from 106 to 119 regular-season points. Gretzky won the scoring title with 205 points that season, by 79 points over teammate Paul Coffey. The Oilers powered to their first Cup this spring.Winnipeg defeated Calgary 3-1 in the first round.Edmonton swept Winnipeg 4-0 in the second round.The Jets posted their first-ever playoff series victory, dispatching the Flames. A major edge was finishing the season in second spot with 96 points and gaining home-ice advantage on the Flames, who had 94. The Jets won the first two games at home but in Game 3 in Calgary, the infamous Jamie Macoun put Hawerchuk out of the playoffs with a vicious cross-check that went unpenalized. One night later, the Jets rebounded from the 4-0 loss to send the Flames to the golf course. In the division final series, same as usual, a sweep by the Oilers. Without their best player, Winnipeg was no match for the eventual Cup champs, who got game-winners in the series from Coffey, Coffey, Gretzky and Jari Kurri. Ouch.Calgary swept Winnipeg 3-0 in the first round.After a miserable season, barely qualifying for the playoffs with 59 points (Vancouver also had 59, the Kings had 54), the Jets were no match for the consistent Flames, losing 5-1, 6-4 and 4-3 in OT. The Jets used four goalies in the series, Marc Behrend, Brian Hayward, junior callup Daniel Berthiaume and Dan Bouchard.Winnipeg defeated Calgary 4-2 in the first round.Edmonton swept Winnipeg 4-0 in the second round.Behind the goaltending of Berthiaume, the Jets rode the Flames out of the first round again, this time 88-95 underdogs in the Smythe's 2-3 matchup. The games were tight, apart from the 6-1 clincher in Winnipeg, the first series where the white-out took full effect at the old Winnipeg Arena. Alas, the fun didn't last long as the Oilers swept the Jets for a fourth straight time, this time in the second round. Hawerchuk led the Jets in that spring's playoffs with 13 points in 10 games, at least exacting a little revenge on the Flames for the happenings of two years earlier.Edmonton defeated Winnipeg 4-1 in the first round.Part of the legend of Randy Gilhen is supported in this spring's playoffs. He fired the NHL franchise's first-ever playoff game-winning goal against the Oilers. The Jets were once again outmatched against the Oilers, but this spring managed to win one game, 6-4 at home in Game 3. And that was something, if you can believe it.Edmonton defeated Winnipeg 4-3 in the first round.After an awful season out of the 1989 playoffs, one that cost both Dan Maloney and Rick Bowness their jobs, Bob Murdoch took over the 1989-90 Jets and pushed the Jets back to respectability with 85 points, easily third in the Smythe. They drew the second-place Oilers, again, but this time with a more balanced team and less reliance on their stars -- remember, this was the season that disillusioned Hawerchuk so much he asked to be traded -- the Jets seemed less afraid of the Oilers. They roared to a 3-1 series lead on Dave Ellett's double-overtime winner on Bill Ranford at the arena, probably to this day the most electric moment in the city's NHL playoff history. But the Oilers rallied once the Jets got their attention, winning the next three 4-3, 4-3 and 4-1, thanks largely to winger Craig Simpson taking up residence in the Winnipeg crease with impunity, an element that became a major distraction for the underdogs. There were also harsh words between the organizations because the Oilers had felt very disrespected by mid-series comments by Jets assistant coach Alpo Suhonen, who was anything but a mainstream thinker and thought the Oilers arrogant. Edmonton wasn't tested this severely in the rest of the playoffs, winning another Cup.Vancouver defeated Winnipeg 4-3 in the first round.The Jets, again inconsistent, finished last in the Smythe and missed the playoffs in 1991, this time costing Murdoch his job. When John Paddock took over for 1991-92, the team fought its way back in with 81 points. The fourth-place standing drew the first-place Vancouver Canucks. Again in this one, the Jets, featuring Eddie Olczyk and Phil Housley, and rookie Keith Tkachuk for the playoffs, started fast, splitting in Vancouver and then winning Games 3 and 4 at home, 4-2 and 3-1 behind the goaltending of Rick Tabaracci. But again, the Jets couldn't get over the hump and when the powerful Canucks woke up in this series, they couldn't be controlled. Vancouver won the final three games 8-2, 8-3 and 5-0 to complete the comeback.Vancouver defeated Winnipeg 4-2 in the first round.With 87 points and a fourth-place standing after a dreadful start to the season, the Jets again qualified and again drew the first-place Canucks. Winnipeg had a new weapon for this one, Teemu Selanne, a rookie unlike any other -- ever -- in the NHL. The Jets dropped the first two games in Vancouver, 4-2 and 3-2 but rallied to win Game 3 at home on a hat-trick goal by Selanne, 5-4. A 3-1, empty-net-goal loss at home in Game 4 put the Jets behind the eight-ball, but they lived to play another day when they rallied from down 3-1 in Vancouver to win Game 5 on Selanne's overtime goal. Winnipeg had three leads on home ice in Game 6 but couldn't close the deal, and Greg Adams scored a dubious goal in overtime to end the game 4-3, and the series. Adams' goal, shoving Jets goalie Bob Essensa and the puck into the net, wouldn't count today. It caused the NHL to rewrite its rule on goaltender contact and covered pucks.Detroit defeated Winnipeg 4-2 in the first round.Two more springs without playoffs (now having switched to the Central Division) led to the lame-duck season of 1995-96, a largely painful affair until the very end. Overall attendance was low but with nostalgia clearly in play, perked up near the end of the season when the Jets made it into the playoffs with a win in their second-last game over L.A. Had Winnipeg not laid an egg in Anaheim in its final game, it would have jumped up and played the Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs. Instead, as the eighth seed, the Jets drew the mighty Detroit Red Wings. It didn't go well out of the gate, dropping games in Detroit 4-1 and 4-0. At home, the Jets responded by winning 4-1 but their momentum was short-lived as Detroit took Game 4 easily, 6-1. Game 5 of the series provided good and bad news. The Jets won the contest on the remarkable goaltending of Nik Khabibulin, 3-1, but lost captain Kris King to a season-ending injury when he was knee-checked by Detroit's Sergei Fedorov, who went unpunished when the NHL turned a blind eye. That brought the series back to the historic final game in Winnipeg, April, 28, 1996, and the Jets, though they tried their best, were just no match for the powerful Wings, losing 4-1. No Jets player had more than three points in the six-game series.
In the shadow of Greek prison, locals dread Golden Dawn trial  They have learned to live with over 2,000 prisoners on their doorstep, some of them notorious extremists and hardened killers. But for those with homes and businesses situated beneath the high walls of the Korydallos prison, the country's leading correctional facility, hosting Greece's biggest trial in over a decade is too much. On April 20, a special court inside Korydallos will convene for the Golden Dawn trial, the culmination of a mass probe implicating nearly 70 members and alleged supporters of Greece's neo-Nazi party. After a 15-month investigation, state prosecutors will try to prove that the aggressive anti-immigrant group operated as a criminal organisation under a military-style leadership that allegedly encouraged the beating -- and possibly the killing -- of migrants and political opponents. Under the command of party founder Nikos Michaloliakos, a 58-year-old disgraced former officer cadet, Golden Dawn has already been linked by investigating magistrates to at least two murders. Local officials are bracing for trouble, noting that anti-fascist groups have already called protests for the start of the trial. "The trial cannot and must not be held here," Korydallos' mayor Stavros Kasimatis told AFP. "This is Greece's biggest trial in 40 years. It will last at least 18 months. There will be gatherings by anti-fascist groups, and Golden Dawn supporters will perhaps muster as well." Anti-fascist groups, political parties and unions say they will hold a demonstration outside the prison on the opening day. Kasimatis said that to keep rival groups apart, the police will probably be forced to erect barriers on one of Korydallos' main streets, just a few metres from the district's central school complex and nurseries. "How can the city possibly operate under these conditions?" asked Kasimatis, who has the support of his neighbouring mayors and local lawmakers. Korydallos prison last hosted a trial of this magnitude over a decade ago, when the authorities dismantled the far-left extremist group November 17. But whereas few spoke out in defence of suspected extremists at the time, Golden Dawn is a legitimate parliamentary party that can bring in supporters from across the country, the mayor notes. Wherever Golden Dawn members have appeared in court for other cases in recent months, dozens of supporters have been stationed inside and outside the courtroom in a bid to intimidate witnesses, anti-fascist groups say. Last month, the trial of Golden Dawn's spokesman Ilias Kasidiaris, who was accused of striking a female Communist lawmaker, had to be interrupted when party supporters heckled the victim. "Golden Dawn members usually cram (into) the courtroom from dawn. We do not want this to happen, and will take all necessary measures to prevent it," anti-fascist activist Takis Giannopoulos told AFP. Justice Minister Nikos Paraskevopoulos last month admitted in parliament that the choice of venue was "problematic" as the makeshift courtroom inside the Korydallos female inmates' wing was too small to handle the global interest in the trial. "Right now there is no alternative option," Paraskevopoulos said, but he left open the possibility of a break in the proceedings after the first day, until a suitable solution is found. The trial, to be conducted by a panel of three judges, follows a 15-month investigation sparked by the fatal stabbing of Greek anti-fascist rapper Pavlos Fyssas by a Golden Dawn supporter in September 2013. The group was later also linked to the murder of a Pakistani immigrant and beatings of political opponents. The defendants at the trial include Michaloliakos and around a dozen Golden Dawn parliamentary lawmakers. Most face charges of membership in a criminal organisation, a serious offence in Greece. Others are accused of murder, conspiracy to murder, possession of weapons and racist violence. Some of the defendants, who include police officers, face sentences of up to 20 years in prison if convicted. The openly xenophobic and anti-Semitic Golden Dawn party was for years a semi-clandestine group on the fringes of Greek politics. But in 2012 the party exploited widespread anger over immigration and austerity reforms prompted by Greece's financial crisis and won 18 seats in parliament. Although its members had been known to patrol the streets, carrying out attacks on foreigners, the party rarely faced sanctions until the murder of rapper Fyssas. Michaloliakos and a number of others were arrested, and a subsequent search of party members' homes uncovered firearms and other weapons, as well Nazi and fascist memorabilia. Golden Dawn rejects the accusations as politically motivated and the group held on to its support base in January's general election when it finished third, winning 17 seats in the 300-member legislature.
Multimillion-pound plans to redevelop a shopping centre known as "the spaceship" have gone on display.The Agora centre was opened in Wolverton, Milton Keynes, in 1979, but has fallen into disrepair.Brickhill Estates wants to turn the site into 90 flats and 25,000 sq ft (2,322 sq m) of retail space.The proposals have been put on the architect's website for public consultation before a formal planning application is submitted.Neil Hollingworth, director of Brickhill Estates, said: "People refer to the Agora as the spaceship which landed in the centre of Wolverton."It's totally out of character with the rest of the town."This plan would rejuvenate and bring forward Wolverton as a town, and provide affordable housing for young people."But Marie Osbourne, director of Future Wolverton, said while the community was "glad to see a plan to get rid of the Agora" there were concerns their hopes for the Agora might not be met.
Richmond's injury management plan for Brett Deledio could have a delay built in by the match review panel after the Tigers vice-captain was reported for rough conduct in the explosive opening minutes of the round one victory over Carlton.In an eventful start to the new season, Deledio presented the new match review panel system with its first high-profile case following his high bump on Simon White, running in from the centre square to collect White in the head and shoulder as the Blues tagger slid to win a ground ball from the opening bounce.Deledio was later substituted in the fourth quarter for what Tigers coach Damien Hardwick confirmed was a pre-planned decision as part of getting their key play-maker back to peak fitness.Hardwick said Deledio would be available to play in next week's match against the Western Bulldogs, from a fitness point of view, with a 10-day break between matches for him to recover and progress his build-up from the Achilles' tendon and calf problems that have interrupted his pre-season.But the Tigers must first dodge suspension, and to that end, the fact White was able to get quickly and play out the match is at least a factor in Deledio's favour.Of the incident, Hardwick would say only that "we know Brett is a ball player", adding "the tribunal will take care of that, I really enjoy the new system".The Deledio incident was the only negative on an otherwise encouraging opening night for the Tigers where first-gamer Kamdyn McIntosh relished the big stage (on the eve of his 21st birthday), and Jack Riewoldt also stood up with four goals on an emotional night for the key forward in light of the recent death of his cousin Madeleine - the sister of St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt.McIntosh, making his debut after two years waiting for his chance, had 23 disposals and a goal, highlighting a key element of the win - that the Tigers' top seven ball winners featured the likes of Geelong recruit Taylor Hunt (27 disposals), Nick Vlastuin (21 disposals) and Shane Edwards (seven clearances), rather than the usual suspects of Deledio, Dustin Martin (well tagged by White) and captain Trent Cotchin."Taylor Hunt was very good, [as was] Nick Vlastuin - they're the sort of players that we needed," Hardwick said after the game."We have had faith in our recruiting team to pick those guys and we knew at some stage they would step up," he said."But it's still early in the season. We always knew Carlton would come to shut down those [star players] so it was pleasing for the guys like Taylor Hunt and others to step up and really deliver for us tonight."It was a point re-emphasised by Carlton coach Mick Malthouse, lamenting that his team allowed the Tigers "second tier players" to perform better than expected.Hardwick said the hard-running McIntosh still had parts of his game to improve but was overall "very pleased"."We always knew we had a player. He's been three years in the making," the coach said."His ability to work from contest to contest is very good."Hardwick was similarly happy for Riewoldt as he turned the tables on Blues key defender Michael Jamison, who before this game owned a solid record on the Tigers main goal-kicker."The thing we spoke about with Jack is that, it might not be his night but it can be his moment and I thought he really stood up big," Hardwick said."He took a couple of big pack marks which, to be honest, we've haven't seen from Jack for probably 12 months."
Champion trainer Chris Waller has learnt not to dwell on the past when it comes to his horses but that has been difficult with Always Allison.The talented filly arrived at his stables after Golden Slipper nominations had closed and there was always the feeling that could be an opportunity missed.But it is one she could make up for in the Sires Produce Stakes at Randwick on Saturday."She wasn't in the Slipper, so it wasn't really in our thinking. However, once they start to do what she did, you think about it," Waller said. "But it wasn't mean to be."There aren't that many group 1s for two-year-old so when you have a filly like her you want to try at that level."Always Allison won her debut at Warwick Farm before scoring in the Sweet Embrace Stakes, which opened the door on the possibility of paying a late entry for the Golden Slipper. It came down to the Magic Night Stakes.But luck deserted the More Than Ready filly as she was held-up and checked in the straight, going to the line really untested."She had no luck last start and was very good before that," Waller said. "It was the Percy Sykes or the Sires and I would rather go a week earlier and it is a group 1."She is ready to race, but you are always thinking have we gone one run too many with her but I don't think we have left it on the track with her." Joao Moreira has been booked for the ride on Always Allison but will need to be at his best to overcome barrier 11."It is another one of those things you can't do anything about," Waller said.  "You talk a lot about barriers before a race but rarely after it and I think she should get her chance over the 1400m."Waller has a strong influence on the Doncaster with Sacred Falls, Royal Descent and Moriarty assured runs and the Australian Derby favourite in Preferment, which returned to his best in the Rosehill Guineas when photo finished by Volkstok'n'barrell."He showed in the Rosehill Guineas he just needed to get to a trip," Waller said."I think he will be a dominate group 1 horse at 2400m and he has improved since that run."He showed at Flemington how strong he is over the extra trip, even when he was three-wide and I think he will be hard to beat again."
Islamabad responded quickly to Saudi Arabia’s call for military assistance in its air-strikes against the Houthis in Yemen, making Pakistan the only non-Arab country involved in the conflict.The question now is why Pakistan has rushed to help Saudi Arabia take down the Houthis.One reason is that Nawaz Sharif has no choice because it was the Saudis who rescued him when he was forced into exile by General Pervez Musharraf in October 1999. Sharif spent seven years in Saudi Arabia before returning to Pakistan in 2003.But not everyone in Pakistan is as eager to join the Saudis in Yemen. According to a report by BBC Urdu, the anti-US right-wing Pakistan Justice Movement (PTI), which is the third largest party, is concerned about the country’s participation in Yemen.Critics say Pakistan cannot afford to back the Saudis is because the military is currently engaged in a campaign against the Taliban in theNorth Waziristan region. Yemen would be a distraction and provide the Taliban with an opportunity to reassemble and plan future terrorist attacks.What is more, Pakistan is home to 30 million Shias who oppose the government’s support for Saudi Arabia.
United State Secretary of State, John Kerry, has commended President Goodluck Jonathan, President-Elect Muhammadu Buhari and the Chairman of the Nigerian electoral body, Attahiru Jega, over peaceful and successful presidential and parliamentary elections at the weekend.Kerry said in a statement released by the State Department that the United States is committed to working with the newly elected government that emerges on 29 May.The United States congratulates the people of Nigeria and the Nigerian Government on historic and largely peaceful elections the weekend of March 28. We especially applaud all voters who showed patience and demonstrated their commitment to participate in the democratic process.The United States commends Nigeria’s Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and its Chairman, Attahiru Jega, on the generally orderly vote, on the use of technology such as card readers to increase the credibility and transparency of the electoral process, and on prompt communication of the results. While we note reports of logistical problems, such incidents did not undermine the overall outcome of the election.In January, I traveled personally to Nigeria and met with both President Jonathan and now President-Elect Buhari. At that time, I emphasized that for the United States, Nigeria is an increasingly important strategic partner and that Nigeria has a critical role to play in the security and prosperity of this continent and beyond.I also said that it was imperative that these elections are an improvement over past elections and that they need to set a new standard for this democracy. That means that Nigerians needed to not only reject violence but actually promote peace.We laud both President Jonathan and General Buhari for their public commitments to the Abuja Accord signed in January and reaffirmed March 26, respecting the official results, and encouraging their supporters to do the same. We commend President Jonathan for his years of service and for having acted in the best interest of his country. We welcome President Jonathan’s calls for unity and calm during this transition period.Finally, we extend our congratulations to President-elect Buhari. The United States reiterates its commitment to working with the newly elected government that emerges from this democratic process.

Two variables accounted for the success of the Nigerian polls: the resoluteness of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) chairman and the integrity of the collation officers.Many Ghanaians who watched the live coverage of the proceedings from the ornate hall or situation room at Abuja where the results were collated and announced, could not subdue their awe at the quality of the dignitaries who presented the results from the various states.The eggheads who sincerely discharged the national assignment bestowed upon them could not have afforded to disappoint their compatriots. They were vice chancellors and academicians of exceptional repute. Nobody could fault their integrity.As they stood in front of the world to announce the results from various states as fingers were being bitten and teeth gnashed, they commanded deference – the kind reserved for personalities in their exclusive class.The natural urge to juxtapose the Ghanaian experience with the Nigerian brought out the difference, glaringly of course.Compare Prof Attahiru Jega the INEC chairman, with his Ghanaian counterpart, Dr. Kwadwo Afari-Gyan. While the Nigerian is level-headed, on top of his assignments, his opposite number in Ghana is a byword for hubris and inefficiency, with no room for suggestions or recommendations.Whereas Jega stands for the subservience of his office to the will of the people, Afari-Gyan on the other hand erroneously thinks he is not responsible to anybody, seemingly misconstruing the independence of the Electoral Commission (EC).The just ended polls in Nigeria surprised many Ghanaians who foresaw mayhem and a disorganized election. Consider the time used by Jega and his team to register voters even in internally displaced persons’ camp in Boko Haram infested parts of the north. It was amazing that they could achieve such feat within a record time.In a country which does not come near one of the 36 states constituting Nigeria in terms of population, the reason Afari-Gyan and his team do not always get it right even if they are well resourced, is palpably because of endemic ineptitude.At the best of times elections are organized in tots resulting in integrity questions – the most recent one ending up in a fractious petition court hearing which exposed the many fault-lines in our election management – the most prominent being the maintenance of a flawed voter register.An application of the Nigerian election quality standard as rolled out last Saturday and the subsequent days, especially the card reading novelty, should not be ignored in 2016 and beyond. That is not to gloss over the glaring challenges that cropped up over malfunctioning biometric machines.Be it as it may, there were a lot of lessons – some of them crucial – for us to learn from. Had Afari-Gyan been put in Jega’s shoes, the outcome would have been anybody’s guess.
Europe's pioneering probe Rosetta battled breakdowns with navigation and communication with Earth after it ran into blasts of dust and gas from the comet it is tracking, mission control said Thursday.Swooping close to Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, Rosetta "experienced significant difficulties" last weekend and had to go into safe mode, the European Space Agency (ESA) said."The spacecraft has now been successfully recovered, but it will take a little longer to resume normal scientific operations," it said in a blog.On its Twitter feed, Rosetta said, "Had some difficulties... thanks for kind messages. I'm feeling much better & hoping to resume normal activities soon!"Rosetta has been circling Comet 67/P since last August, catching up with the wanderer after a 10-year, 6.5-billion-kilometre (four-billion-mile) chase across the heavens.The 1.3-billion-euro ($1.4-billion) mission seeks to unveil the secrets of comets, believed to be time capsules from the birth of our Solar System.The target comet is getting closer to the Sun with every second, and the solar heat is causing its surface to warm.This in turn is causing dust to be stripped away and gases to heat and blast out into space.It is this spectacular show that, at times, can be seen from Earth in the fiery "coma" of the comet.For Rosetta, though, the outpouring proved to be a problem on an unexpected scale, as the orbiter raced to within 14 kilometres (8.75 miles) of the surface.Flying through dense, outflowing gas and dust exposed the spacecraft's solar panels, like outstretched wings, to drag.Another problem was that Rosetta is designed to navigate by locking on to the stars -- and its trackers mistook hundreds of pieces of comet debris for stars.As a result, the spacecraft began to drift and its high-gain antenna, used to send and receive signals from ground stations on Earth, started to point away from home and communications began to drop.Rosetta placed itself into safe mode on Sunday, and by Monday, ground teams had brought it back to normal status, the blog said (http://blogs.esa.int/rosetta/2015/04/01/rosetta-status-report-close-flyby-navigation-issues/).The craft is now at a safer distance of 200 km from the comet, and "limited science operations" will be resumed in the coming days and weeks.Future trajectories are being reviewed to take into account the likelihood that the comet will discharge even greater dust and gas as it heads towards perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, in August.On November 12, Rosetta sent down a fridge-sized robot lab, Philae, which carried out a 54-hour roster of experiments before its battery ran out of power.The lander is believed to be in the shadow of a cliff, preventing its solar panels from getting enough sunlight to power up. The mission hopes Philae will revive as 67/P gets closer to the Sun.Rosetta on Thursday was 423 million km from Earth and 293 million km from the Sun, according to the mission's website (http://sci.esa.int/where_is_rosetta/).Perihelion will be on August 13, when the comet will be 186 million km from the Sun.
Rekha Nagvanshi, 30, was unhappy with her husband's parents and decided to add the natural flavouring to their drinks whenever his mum and dad came round for a cuppa.She was found out when the mum-in-law entered the kitchen and saw her squatting over the teapot for a tinkle.Her friend Alia Kohli, 32, said: "She was very unhappy with her arranged marriage and said her husband treated her like a slave and eventually she decided she’d had enough."But after moving out, he begged her to go back for the sake of their four-year-old daughter."She agreed but only if he cooked for her, massaged her feet and did all the washing up."Rekha moved back in to the martial home with husband Deepak, 34, in the district of Indore in India's central Madhya Pradesh state.But her parents-in-law Suraj, 60, and Ajith, 55, found out about the arrangement and tried to stop it.Kohli said: "Rekha's husband seemed fine with it but the in-laws went mental and accused her of treating him like a slave."Rekha is strong-minded and likes to be independent and the thought of being dictated to by his parents was just too much for her."So I guess that’s when she decided to start doing what she did, and urinating in their tea."
Abuja - Nine Chadian soldiers were killed and 16 wounded after being ambushed by Boko Haram fighters in northeastern Nigeria, the Chadian army said Thursday.A military spokesman said fighting took place on Wednesday about 10 kilometres (six miles) from the town of Malam Fatori, which Niger said was retaken by regional forces fighting the Islamist radicals earlier this week.“Elements of the Chad-Niger (military alliance) were killed in a pocket of resistance,” Colonel Azem Bermandoa Agouna told AFP.“After heavy fighting, the armed forces of Chad and Niger totally cleaned up the zone,” the spokesman added.The allied troops killed “more than 100” members of Boko Haram, a ruthless fundamentalist sect that has killed at least 13 000 people since it launched an insurgency in northeast Nigeria in 2009, according to a military statement said.Large quantities of equipment were also seized by the soldiers.When the joint force took Malam Fatori on Tuesday, they were unopposed because Boko Haram fighters had gone, but some of the Islamists remained in the vicinity, Agouna said.A violent skirmish took place on Wednesday between Malam Fatori and the border town of Bosso in Niger, a high-ranking officer in Niger's army reported at the time, giving no further details.Niger's army was due to release casualty figures, he added.That battle left “many wounded on the Chadian and Nigerien sides”, according to a humanitarian relief official, who added that “deaths and arrests” were likely among Boko Haram's ranks.The capture of Malam Fatori was crucial for the regional coalition, which also includes Cameroon and Benin, and has finally moved into Nigeria as outgoing President Goodluck Jonathan came under mounting criticism for the failure of a powerful army to defeat the Islamists.Malam Fatori, close to Nigeria's northeast border, had become known as Boko Haram's main refuge in the region whenever its fighters fell back after defeats.Chadian and Nigerien troops made the town a primary target once they entered Nigeria on March 8, marking the start of foreign military operations on the home territory of the Islamist sect.After the swift capture of the Nigerian town of Damasak, coalition troops have pressed on eastwards close to the border with Niger, successively taking Gachagar, Talagam, Abadam, then Malam Fatori.Chadian troops, active around the Lake Chad region where the Nigerian border converges with those of Chad, Cameroon and Niger, are also operating on a second front, based on Cameroonian territory.
Luke Lapointe (11) created the shelter with help from his dad David, using wood and corrugated roofing materials.Other pupils also joined in the project creating models which were put on display at St Machan’s Primary in Lennoxtown.Primary Seven teacher Hannah Nisbet said: ‘‘The models were excellent across the board. They were fantastic and so creative.“I asked the children to think about what materials they were using for their models. One even made an Anderson Shelter out of cake.”While most of the models were of normal shoe-box size, Luke’s creation wowed the whole school.Miss Nisbet added: “He came in and asked if he could make a big shelter. I assumed he still meant out of paper and said yes.“His mum sent him to double-check and I still said yes.“One day he said he had brought it in, but had to keep it in the foyer as it couldn’t make it up the stairs!”All 27 models were admired by visitors to the school at last week’s parents’ evenings and Luke’s creation will now form part of a permanent display at the school.Miss Nisbet said: “They were asked to design an Anderson Shelter as part of the World War Two topic.“It was a personal project to give them independence and responsibility.”Luke was helped by his dad David (42) who is a joiner.Mum June said: “David did a lot of the work, but Luke did all the painting and was the supervisor.”Luke said: “I decided to do something big as I thought it would be easier than cutting up small things.”

Rustenburg - Three men have been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a taxi operator, North West police said on Thursday.Colonel Sabata Mokgwabone said China Moloi, 39, Nkululo Vava, 29, and Dalikhaya Nompojwane, 30, were sentenced by the North West High Court, sitting in Mogwase near Rustenburg on Tuesday.“The accused were found guilty of the planned murder, instigated by China Moloi who had sold his Corsa bakkie to raise funds in order to pay his friends R20 000 for killing the man,” said Col Mokgwabone.He said the three killed Sello Peter Mogale ,62, at his home in Phokeng outside Rustenburg in January 2014.“They all went to the victim’s house where on arrival, they cut the fence to gain entrance and hid themselves in the yard and waited for the victim to return home. It was upon the arrival of the victim the trio, who were all armed with firearms, shot him several times as he got out of the vehicle inside the garage.”He said police investigation revealed that the murder was motivated by taxi squabbles, after Moloi had bought a minibus taxi which he forcefully tried to operate within the routes of Phokeng without the approval of the local association, of which Mogale was a member.The three were arrested at the Rustenburg taxi rank, Freedom Park informal settlement and Sefikile village near Swartklip.“We are delighted that we managed to secure a maximum sentence and hope that this is an indication that crime does not pay”, said provincial commissioner Lieutenant General Zukiswa Mbombo.

A motorist was given a £100 parking fine when he stopped to wait for police to report a rape.The 32-year-old man had gone to Shirley police station in Southampton with the victim who was his friend, but the station was closed.So they advised him to wait in a nearby car park where he would be met by officers to escort them to the city centre station.While waiting for police they did not pay and they were given a parking penalty.The driver appealed to the parking firm, but he was rejected.He told the Southern Daily Echo: ‘I wrote in a letter to them about the situation and provided them with a crime number and told them we had been advised by police to wait there. At no point did we leave the vehicle and their cameras will show we were sat there for the whole time.‘And when the police car arrived we followed it out of the car park.’However, the parking firm has now agreed to cancel the fine.A Premier Park spokesman said: ‘A parking charge was issued to a vehicle which had entered and stayed in the car park in excess of a 40-minute period without registering.‘An appeal was then received three weeks after the event and, based on the initial information within this appeal, rejected.‘The independent appeals service, Parking on Private Land Appeals (POPLA) was then offered and used by the driver to make a further appeal.‘This appeal was also rejected by POPLA. Despite the charge being issued correctly, due to additional, mitigating evidence being supplied we have now cancelled the charge, but would advise anyone receiving a charge to appeal promptly and include all relevant evidence in their appeal.’Police are continuing to look into the alleged rape.
On Tuesday‚ a “revealing” dress worn by Jane Moloisi-Sithole was debated during a discussion on vice problems in Witbank.According to Moloisi-Sithole‚ ANC MPL Vusimuzi Windvoël “compared it to a dress worn by prostitutes”.Then‚ said Moloisi-Sithole‚ speaker Thandi Shongwe “immediately ruled that my dress was too revealing to be worn in the house and that it was not in line with the decorum of the house…Instead of the speaker protecting my dignity as a woman‚ she entertained their sexual innuendos and attacked me from the presiding officer seat”.Moloisi-Sithole said she will write to the Commission for Gender Equality “to stop this kind of oppression by the speaker to other women‚ just because they are from a different political party”.Anthony Benadie‚ the leader of the opposition in the legislature‚ added: “The unprecedented outcry that we have witnessed online‚ in the media and through various social networks from the public‚ has once again proven how important women’s rights are and that the ANC must take this issue serious(ly).”Benadie added that his party would approach the SA Human Rights Commission‚ as well as demand a debate on “the conduct of the Speaker…to ensure that her inability to preside over proceedings of the house is exposed and the dignity of our colleague is restored”.

Families of those killed aboard the Germanwings flight are likely to receive vastly different payouts depending on their nationality, where they bought the ticket, and how much they earned, even though they all shared the same fate, lawyers said.
A spokesman for Somalia’s Al-Qaeda-linked Shebab, told AFP the group was behind the early morning assault on the university in Garissa and had taken non-Muslims hostage.“When our men arrived, they released the Muslims. We are holding others hostage,” said Shebab spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage, without giving numbers.He said those seized were Christians and added that “our people are still there, they are fighting and their mission is to kill those who are against the Shebab.” “Kenya is at war with Somalia,” Rage said, referring to the thousands of Kenyan troops in Somalia as part of an African Union military mission.Gunfire could still be heard sporadically six hours after the attack began, as Kenya’s interior ministry said the “attackers have been cornered in one hostel.” Kenya’s interior ministry also said “one suspected terrorist” had been arrested attempting “to flee scene“.At least 15 people have been killed, according to a police source and media reports, while Kenya’s official National Disaster Operation Centre said a further 65 had been injured, many suffering from gunshot wounds.The Kenya Red Cross, which is leading the medical response to the attack, said there were “an unknown number of student hostages” and that “50 students have been safely freed“.Rage did not give details of casualties but said “there are very many.” The town of Garissa is around 150 kilometres (90 miles) west of Somalia and has in the past been targeted by militants from the Shebab.“Gunmen forced their way into Garissa University by shooting at the guards manning the main gate at around 5:30 am,” said Kenya Police Chief Joseph Boinet. “The gunmen shot indiscriminately while inside the university compound.” The sprawling campus, on the outskirts of the garrison town, has both teaching areas as well as residential blocks.The university has several hundred students from different parts of Kenya. The number of teachers and students trapped inside the campus was unclear as gunfire and explosions were heard coming from the site.“Police... engaged the gunmen in a fierce shootout, however the attackers retreated and gained entry into one of the hostels,” Boinet said, adding that reinforcements had arrived and were “flushing out the gunmen.”   A witness, Ahmed Nur, said he saw the bodies of two university guards, shot by the attackers.  Kenya Red Cross, quoting local health officials, said that 30 people had been taken to hospital, “the majority” with gunshot wounds.  Kenya has been hit by a wave of grenade and gun attacks, often blamed on sympathisers of Somalia’s Shebab Islamist fighters and sometimes aimed at police targets, since the army crossed into southern Somalia in 2011 to attack Islamist bases.A series of foreign travel warnings in response to the threat have crippled Kenya’s economically important tourism industry. On Wednesday, just hours before the attack in Garissa began, President Uhuru Kenyatta said Kenya “is safe as any country in the world“.Kenya’s government has been under fire since the September 2013 Shebab attack on the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi, in which at least 67 people were killed in a siege involving just four gunmen and which lasted four days.In June and July last year Shebab gunmen killed close to 100 people in a series of attacks on the town of Mpeketoni and nearby villages.In November Shebab claimed responsibility for holding up a bus outside Mandera town, separating passengers according to religion and murdering 28 non-Muslims. Ten days later 36 non-Muslim quarry workers were also massacred in the area.Students in Garissa on Thursday reported seeing up to four masked gunmen entering the university compound before dawn.The area surrounding  the university was sealed off by the Kenya security forces and the army called in.
The reclusive Baw Baw frog might be tiny, but the first birthday of 54 of the endangered amphibians was a big deal at Melbourne Zoo on Thursday.Keepers opened the frog's normally isolated bunker to show off their prodigy for the cameras and to discuss their hopes that this group might hold the key to bringing the species back from the brink of extinctionThe frogs hatched from eggs collected from Mount Baw Baw in 2013, and the zoo's amphibian specialist, Deon Gilbert, said creating a genetically diverse group to breed from is a priority.Breeding is not possible until they reach sexual maturity at about six years of age, while they can live up to 30 years, Gilbert said."The frogs reach a maximum of six centimetres at maturity and live underground, which has made them a difficult subject for experts to observe in the wild," he said."Not a great deal is known about them, but they are a good indication of environmental fitness in their natural habitat."A recent field trip discovered their numbers in the wild have shrunk 30 per cent in the past two years. The Amphibian Chytrid Fungus, which originated in Africa, is the main cause of the frog's decline. Gilbert said the fungus attacks their skin and tadpole development.

Russia will use ‘nuclear force’ on Nato forces if they move into the three Baltic countries as a response to its annexation of Crimea, according a leaked memo.The threat was made by Russian generals during a meeting with United States representatives in Germany last month, according to notes viewed by The Times.They warned any Nato troop movement into Estonia, Lativa or Lithuania could be met with a ‘spectrum of responses from nuclear to non-military’.Russia was also apparently unhappy with the possibility of Nato sending weapons to Ukraine in attempt to help win Crimea back and said it would need to respond forcefully to this encroachment.The notes, written by an American observer, added the global power was already contemplating action in the Baltic States (which are members of Nato) but this was likely be under the radar.MORE: How many Scrabble games can be played in 24 hours?

As a child, Marian Ciopicz used to play with his friends in piles of asbestos waste behind the now-notorious Wunderlich factory in Sunshine North."It was simply a terrific area for a child to play," Mr Ciopicz told his lawyers in a deathbed statement in 2014."We threw handfuls of waste at each other, they exploded on impact, played hide and seek and war games and so on. When playing there it sometimes felt like we were in a snow storm. The air was full of white or grey dust and we were completely covered in it — hair, ears, all over our clothes and so on. It was great fun."Mr Ciopicz said children regularly played in the area behind the factory, which extended down to the railway line, but was not fenced off.It's believed more than 20 people have contracted asbestos-related diseases from exposure to the factory, which operated until 1982. During peak production in the 1950s to the 1970s, clouds of asbestos dust rose above the factory roof, shrouding nearby streets, coating cars and making its way into homes.According to Brimbank Council the asbestos on the former factory site — now the Westend Market Hotel — was capped and buried, but nearby residents have raised concerns about rabbits digging in the area and disturbing the deadly waste. It says the EPA is working with the current site owners to manage the risks.After battling asbestosis for two years, Mr Ciopicz, a 69-year-old father of three and grandfather of six, died in October last year. After he died, his widow, Carolyn, kept up his battle for compensation and recognition that his illness had been caused by exposure to the site.While justice came too late for Mr Ciopicz, on Thursday a Supreme Court jury awarded his family $467,000 in damages, the first asbestos-related payout in Victoria in a decade.The jury found that the owner and operator of the former Wunderlich factory, Seltsam Pty Ltd, had negligently allowed Marian Copicz's exposure to asbestos dust and fibres.Slater and Gordon lawyer Michael Magazanik said the company had neglected to put up signs warning neighbours of the dangers of the site, or properly fence the McIntyre Road factory.The jury was told that trucks leaving the factory spilled asbestos dust over local roads, and that fans inside the factory blew asbestos fibres into the air above the factory.Silvio Comin, who worked at the Wunderlich factory, told the trial there was so much asbestos waste piled in the backyard behind the factory that he had to wear sunglasses to cope with the glare.He said that dust at times escaped four to five metres into the air above the factory and when it was windy, it was "just like a snowstorm".Mr Magazanik said the family's case had not been about money, but recognition."Most of all, this case is about recognition that this factory had caused their husband's, father's, grandfather's death. They only wanted proper recognition. They wanted justice."In a statement released by her lawyers, Mrs Ciopicz spoke of her husband and family's determination to get justice."Marian would have wanted me to finish what he started," she said."Marian was a brave man who fought his illness to the very end. If it weren't for that asbestos factory and its disgraceful pollution we would still have him here."Wunderlich let little children use its toxic dump as a playground. That is unbelievable. And so is the fact that they forced us to trial to get justice for Marian."Slater and Gordon says it has had dozens of calls from people concerned about their exposure to the site. It is the first asbestosis legal claim to run to verdict in Victoria in a decade. Previous cases have settled out of court.

Many Clouds ridden by Leighton Aspell (L) clearing the final fence on his way to win the 4.15 Crabbie's Grand National Chase ahead of Paddy Brennan on Saint Are (C) and AP McCoy on Shutthefrontdoor (R)All those who followed Crabbie’s Grand National winner Many Clouds home will be aimed at an Aintree return.Trainer Tom George was delighted with Saint Are’s brave effort when second, beaten just a length and three-quarters by Oliver Sherwood’s winner, at Aintree on Saturday.Saint Are challenged the winner strongly on the run to the line, but had to settle for minor honours.His Slad-based trainer is now looking to an Aintree return in 12 months in a bid to go one better.Saint Are is over his exertions and George said: “He’s taken the race unbelievably well. He actually wasn't too tired immediately after the race and he only lost around 14 kilos, which is what a horse will normally lose in a hurdle race.“He’s out in the field and seems as happy as Larry this morning, so we’re delighted with him.“I’m obviously thrilled with the way he’s run. He hit a bit of a flat spot at the Elbow and he’s then run on again at the finish.“I suppose at the back of my mind I’m wondering if they hadn’t moved the start forward 150 yards, would it have made a difference?“Take nothing away from the winner, who is a class horse and won under a big weight, so hats off to him.“I’ve had my horse a year now, I’ve got to know him pretty well and I think we might be able to get some more improvement out of him next season.“He’s still a relatively young horse and there’s no reason why he shouldn’t improve again.”Monbeg Dude, who improved on last year’s seventh-placed finish, to be a staying on third at Aintree.Trainer Michael Scudamore said: “He’s really good this morning. He’s eaten up everything and seems good and well in himself.“He’s done enough for this season and having another crack next year has to be high on the agenda.”
A very clever bearded dragon appears to have mastered the art of the English language, responding when she's asked whether she wants something to eat.Liz the bearded dragon, who lives with owner Shannen Hussein, 21, on her hobby farm in Melbourne, is the star of a recent video taken at mealtime.Shannen can be heard asking Liz: 'Are you hungry?' to which the reptile responds with a definite nod of her scaly head.'Are you hungry Lizzie?' Shannen asks again, which sees Liz nod her head in agreement once again.The bearded dragon is then rewarded for her conversational skills with a superworm treat, which she 'absolutely loves'.According to Shannen Liz will do 'anything for one' of the little larvae.This cheeky reptile isn't the only one of Shannen's pets who is an online superstar, her pet lamb Winter has also recently shot to internet fame.The sheep stars in a number of Vine videos jumping on the bed, running through hallways, pushing over chairs and wrestling with other petsOther pets that Shannen cares for include two cats called Moey and Leo, two birds called Kyah and Jerry, a snake, and a number of ducklings.Turtles, a llama and what appears to be an emu also live on the hobby farm and regularly appear on the young woman's popular social media channels.
The Lagos State Governor-elect, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, has called on the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Mr. Jimi Agbaje, and others who contested against him to join hands with his administration to build the state.Ambode spoke on Sunday while delivering his acceptance speech at the APC secretariat in Lagos shortly after he was declared winner of the governorship election.Ambode was announced winner of the Saturday election after securing 811,994 votes against his PDP’s closest rival, Agbaje who scored 659,788 votes.“To my main opponent, Mr. Jimi Agbaje of the PDP, I thank you for a keen contest and invite you, alongside other governorship candidates, to join hands with me in moving Lagos forward,” he said.Ambode also promised Lagos residents that his administration would build on the legacy and achievements of his predecessors, Gov. Babatunde Fashola and Chief Bola Tinubu.“I am humbled that you have placed your trust and faith in me.“The love of this state and our common belief in what we can accomplish, our belief in what this state already is, and in what it is destined to become binds us together in a social and moral contract of high purpose.“I shall honour that contract with every fiber of my being.“This day I pledge to you that I shall devote myself to bringing even greater prosperity, growth and development to every inch of this state.“I also pledge that I shall build on legacy and progress of my predecessors,” Ambode said.The governor-elect promised to bring the best of ‎Lagos into his government saying that the people would be proud and glad for choosing him as their governor.“The people of Lagos have demonstrated that Lagos is not about ethnicity or religion but about a common desire to enthrone good ‎governance.“Lagos under my watch will not discriminate. It has not in the past, and will not in the present; not even in the future, there will be no political victimisation.“By affirming your faith in the APC and in me, you have, for the first time in 16 years, married progressive governance at the national level with progressive government at the state level,” he said.Ambode noted that finally, Lagos state government and the Federal government would be of one vision, one mind and one accord.“The ramifications of this harmonious unity are completely positive.“This is a chance that we have worked toward for many years.“The joint infrastructural and employment projects and collaboration between the state and the federal will quicken the improvement of our roads, schools, power generation and the entire array of social services.“This new era of cooperation between the state and federal government promises to be a golden period for Lagos and for all Lagosians to share equally therein,” he said.Ambode said Lagos would enjoy optimal development and growth through APC governance working in tandem at the state and federal levels.“This cooperation and enhanced policy harmony will surely pay handsome dividends,” he said.Ambode congratulated INEC for a job well done and keeping alive Nigeria’s hope for a brighter democracy.

The "highly audacious" jewel robbery at Hatton Garden, home to the diamond trade since the 19th Century, has captured the public imagination. But as more details emerge, the mystery deepens and the questions proliferate.In the past few days, it has become clear there was a high level of sophisticated planning. The seven-storey building is home to many businesses, and breaking into the target area of the vault will have taken at least a day.One of the last big robberies to attract news coverage on a similar scale was the £53m Securitas raid in Kent in 2006. In that case, arrests followed fairly quickly.In the Hatton Garden raid, it is still far from clear who might have done it - speculation ranges from an Eastern European gang to east London thieves.Also unclear is exactly what was stolen and how the thieves concealed their actions in such a busy urban area.The other topic of intense speculation is what they might have done with the stolen gems - are they still in the UK or already en route elsewhere?One of the fascinating things about the raid is all the possible missed opportunities to catch the thieves in the act:CCTV images show the robbers disguised as workmen, wearing hard hats and high-visibility jackets.They are later seen wearing balaclavas and gloves and using wheelie bins to move the stolen jewels to a white van.One of them may have hidden inside the building on the Thursday as workers left for the long Easter holiday weekend.They are understood to have disabled the lift, climbed down the shaft to the basement and drilled through the concrete wall - several feet thick - of the huge vaultSome of the equipment used may have been left behind. If so, it could provide vital forensic information to the police.Smaller drills are thought to have been used to break open some 70 out of about 1,000 safety deposit boxes. Some are known to have been empty, but not all those who had deposit boxes in the vault have yet been contacted by police and others are thought to have contained gold, diamonds, and precious watches.The estimated value of the stolen jewels is unknown.Reports have valued the haul at anything from £30m to £200m - but this is speculation, no more, at this stage.Gemmological Association of Great Britain chief executive James Riley told the Sunday Times the jewels had probably already left the country.The UK market was not big enough to absorb that quantity of illicit goods, he said.Instead, they were likely to be sold in places such as Antwerp, New York, Tel Aviv, Mumbai and Hong Kong.Some believe the jewels will have left the country within hours and the thieves will have agreed in advance where they were going.
Thames Valley Police could cope with more cuts as one of the most successful forces in Britain, the Home Secretary has said.Theresa May was speaking at a cross-party debate in Maidenhead where she is standing for re-election as MP.Her comments go against the force's crime commissioner and fellow Tory Anthony Stansfeld, who said the force could not afford another budget slash.She said despite cuts, crime had fallen by about 30% in five years in the area.The force saved £58m in the past five years and needs to save a further £45m.Mrs May said: "Here in the Thames Valley, crime has fallen by around 30% over the last five years; that is the highest fall of any police force of England and Wales."It is thanks to the hard work of police officers and staff that crime has fallen that way here in the Thames Valley. There is no direct link between the number of officers and the rate of crime. What matters is actually how you deploy those officers."Maidenhead's Labour candidate Charles Smith said Labour would strive to "protect some of the frontline policing by getting rid of the disastrous role of police and crime commissioners" and forces sharing services such as procurement.UKIP candidate Herbie Crossman said he was astonished at the idea of cutting police budgets in an "expanding nation".He said: "We've got more problems coming from other countries now wanting to do certain damage to our nation, so how can you cut down on our police force?"Lib Dem candidate Tony Hill said his party had a more "compassionate" view:"One of the best ways is to stop banging so many people up in jail, and bringing in more systems of restorative justice."The Green Party said its candidate, Emily Blyth, was not able to attend the debate.
The No Land Tax Party is on course to secure a seat in the NSW upper house.Half of the Legislative Council seats, a total of 21, were up for grabs at the March 28 election, which was won by the Liberal/Nationals coalition.According to ABC election analyst Antony Green, the results for 20 of those upper house seats are now clear with the coalition picking up nine, Labor seven, the Greens two and one each for the Shooters and Fishers Party and the Christian Democratic Party.With the coalition already holding 11 seats, the government would only need support from the CDP to pass legislation, including its key election promise of leasing the state's electricity network.The race for the 21st seat is a tight contest between the Liberals, the Animal Justice Party and the No Land Tax Party, but according to Mr Green's estimates, No Land Tax is leading the race.The party rose to prominence after it secured the coveted No.1 spot, or the donkey vote position, on the Legislative Council ballot paper.A spokesman for the NSW Electoral Commission said a final declaration of results for the Legislative Council is expected by Saturday.
Ducks and other waterbirds on Adelaide's River Torrens will be monitored for the next 18 months as University of Adelaide researchers investigate what bird flu viruses they may be carrying.The program involves checking and banding ducks and other waterbirds fortnightly to measure their exposure to various forms of avian influenza."We want to discover what strains the waterbirds are carrying, determine how often a new one shows up and measure changes over time in the number of birds exposed to the different viruses," wildlife vet and PhD student Toni Dalziel said.Volunteer duck watchers are also required and anyone interested can register with the university at ua.edu.au/duckwatch.
Hair loss sometimes occurs after pregnancy. Women's health specialist and nutritionist Marilyn Glenville explains: "For some women this can be frightening because it seems like a lot of hair is falling out. But it only looks a lot because in pregnancy you lose less hair due to higher levels of estrogen. After birth, when oestrogen drops, this hair is lost quickly. But after a few months, this evens back out to where you were pre-pregnancy."No one ever talks about these, but many mothers recognize them. They're little flutters and kicks in the womb, just like you have mid-pregnancy. The only thing is, you're definitely not pregnant any more. So why do you still feel like there's a baby kicking away occasionally? There's no officially agreed reason for this, but there are two theories. One is that the uterus can take a long time to stop contracting and settle down after giving birth. The other is that because once you've been pregnant and come to recognize sensations in the uterus for the first time, you are then able to notice random twitches there which happen even when you're not pregnant.  "I still get these nine years after giving birth," says HuffPost Canada Parents reader Kelly.Bleeding gums and wobbly teeth are common post-birth. While breastfeeding, the baby uses so much of your calcium that you need to keep your calcium levels topped up. Reader Lyn, who hates drinking milk or yogurt, lost a tooth with each of her two children. If you don't like dairy or soya products, try leafy green veg for calcium. Glenville says: "If vitamin D levels are good, then you will absorb calcium efficiently and stop losing teeth. If you do have bleeding gums and wobbly teeth, get your vitamin levels checked."Of course, there's all the post-birth bleeding, too, which is often forgotten amid all the excitement of preparing for labour. Some women don't realize that you bleed like a very heavy period for a week or two -- you'll want lots of big sanitary towels, not tampons. Discharge (lochia) can continue for two to four weeks post childbirth. "I would suggest that if you're still bleeding heavily and not as part of a regular bleed two to three months post-birth, you need to see a GP just to be checked," advises Glenville. If you lose a lot of blood at the birth, you can become low on Iron and feel very tired and prone to infections. An iron-rich diet can help.One of the surprising things about lactation is that it can start in small amounts during pregnancy. Then, when you see your baby for the first time, you may find yourself leaking milk without even realizing. Some women can continue to have achy breasts and produce a few drops many months or even years after they have stopped breastfeeding and after their periods have returned. It's all normal.Marilyn explains, "Changes in your hormone levels will have caused muscles and ligaments to become more relaxed ready for labour and this causes the pelvis to be unstable, creating pain and inflammation. These changes can continue after birth." This explains why, after pregnancy, your feet may never return to their previous size. For some women, hands change size too. Katie says, "My hands got bigger, despite losing all my pregnancy weight and more!"Some women report getting achy or "restless" feet and legs in late pregnancy which continues after birth. This could be sciatica, which occurs when inflammation or compression happens as the sciatic nerve leaves the spine. Carpal tunnel syndrome -- loss of sensation in the hands caused by pressure on the median nerve in the wrist -- is also possible after birth. Nicola says: "I had carpal tunnel syndrome and couldn't feel my fingers and part of my hands for three months after giving birth -- not the best for feeling bath temperature or leaky wet diapers."It can take some women months to get their periods back after birth, even after they have stopped breastfeeding. Periods can be heavier or lighter; longer or shorter, or more irregular than before. Glenville says, "This is very common -- it is the body getting back to having a period again after nine months or longer without one. But these changes may continue indefinitely so the periods are not the same as before childbirth." Changes in cycles, she adds, "will vary from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy as the hormones normalize."If you're fully breastfeeding, ovulation is suppressed, so you become less fertile. But if you're not breastfeeding much or at all, watch out -- you're more fertile just after birth. Glenville says, "It is a bit like coming off the Pill. The ovaries have been dormant for nine months (or years if on the Pill) and suddenly they kick start into action after birth (or stopping the Pill) and the woman can be more fertile. Many women have got pregnant before their first period came back thinking they would be less fertile just after birth."It's not just that you gain "baby weight" -- your whole body, but especially your chest and tummy, seem to metamorphose post-childbirth. Once you've experienced maternity jeans, you never really feel comfortable in normal jeans again -- you always look for a nice elasticated or expandable waistband. You eat the same and are always on the go and exhausted, but you're a size bigger from chest to calf -- even old bras no longer do up -- and nothing seems to make any difference. Rachel agrees: "My ribcage expanded after my first pregnancy, and some of my bras and dresses are too tight across there now." Cate says: "My body looks like a sweater that's gone through on the wrong wash -- it's all misshapen with bits now in the wrong place!"The emotional impact of having a first baby is so much bigger than most of us imagine, and this, coupled with the changes in hormones after pregnancy, can cause rocky, tearful emotions and make us feel unusually confused. Glenville says: "Post childbirth, estrogen and progesterone drop dramatically. It is thought that this sudden drop may be the cause of postpartum depression for some women who seem to be more sensitive to this sudden change in hormone levels." Cathryn recalls: "After Eva was born I sat up in bed feeding her -- except she was still asleep in her Moses basket. My husband woke to find me sat there with my arms cradling 'her.'"
Casting for Disney’s planned live action remake of Mulan hasn’t even been announced, but already there are protests around it.Based on an old Chinese legend, the 1998 animated film told the story of Mulan, a Chinese girl who disguises herself as a man to fight a war in the place of her sick father.Following the news last week that a live action version is now in the works, more than 35,000 people have signed an online petition demanding that the titular character be played by an Asian actress, with Hollywood coming under fire recently for casting white actors in roles meant to be from other races.Founder of the Mulan petition Natalie Molnar, writes that so-called whitewashing has a ‘direct, harmful impact on not only the movie itself but the audience’.Adding: ‘Whitewashing implies that people of colour cannot be heroes (although they may at times be villains or supporting characters), leaving it far more difficult for countless children around the world to see themselves in the stories they love and think that they too can make a difference.‘It perpetuates a standard of beauty and goodness wherein whites are considered the ideal and norm despite that not only are Americans diverse, but the entire world is.‘As for the acting community, keeping diverse actors out of what should be diverse roles severely limits the number of roles they can get, especially a potentially name-making role such as Mulan’s eponymous character would surely be.’Other Disney films set to receive future live action treatment include The Jungle Book, Beauty And The Beast, Dumbo and Pinocchio.MORE: Now Disney’s Mulan is getting a live-action remakeMORE: Megan Fox to play Sailor Moon in a live action movie?MORE: Disney apparently ‘want Ryan Gosling to play Beast in live action remake of Beauty and the Beast’
NEARLY 10,000 runners took on the 2015 Brighton Marathon as the spring sun shone on Sussex.The city’s sixth marathon was once again a roaring success as an estimated 100,000 people flooded to the coast to soak up the atmosphere and cheer the hardy runners on.It may not have been a record-breaking day for the elite runners, but about £6 million was raised for charities in what race founder Tim Hutchings called the biggest race ever and 900 people have already signed up for 2016.He said: “There was no course record, but that doesn’t really matter.“The crowds were probably the biggest we’ve ever seen and it’s the first sunny day we’ve had for a couple of years and that always makes a difference.“The Beach Village has really grown and now charities are able to set up there and offer runners so much more as a way of thanks.“I would say it’s been our biggest year.“It was a well oiled machine and that’s down to Tom Naylor as race director and the hundreds of people giving their time and efforts to make sure it runs smoothly – I’ve been blown away by it.“We were convinced we were going to get through the 10,000 barrier, but I’m sure something will be able to tell us why we haven’t done that, but again, it doesn’t matter, because the subjective feedback we’ve had has been incredible.”It was a Kenyan double when it came to the elite athletes, as Duncan Maiyo and Pennina Wanjiru crossed as the fastest man and woman.Brighton College teacher Chris Thompson was the second Briton to finish the Brighton Marathon.And as the clock ticked into the afternoon the amateur runners began piling over the finish line in weird and wonderful costumes.Despite an estimated £6 million spent in the city over the weekend, some business owners in Madeira Drive were unimpressed by the way the marathon had been organised, restricting access to their shops.Greg Harman, owner of The Madeira Cafe, said: “It's too controlled access, no one can get to us.“I reckon the tax man would think we were lying if he looked at our books from today. Despite all these people we do worse than on a normal day.“They should build a bridge going over the track like they have on Kings Road.“It’s a great event for Brighton as it attracts so many people. But there are winners and losers in this event, and we are the losers.”The temporary bridge over the King’s Road that gives people access over the race course to the beach was installed for the marathon both last year and this year.David Roberts, owner of Fish and Liquor, which first opened up three months ago said: “It would be good if access was opened up for businesses. We spent a lot of money on extra stock for today, but the way it’s been organised we'll probably make less than a normal day.“Five people tweeted us today saying they couldn't get to us.”Mr Hutchings said: “We bring 100,000 people to the city and 99% of the businesses will have done well today. For those that haven’t we’d love to hear from them because we don’t want anybody going away feeling let down by the event.”Kev Luxford, owner of The Grand Junction, a cafe and restaurant west of the pier which is just below bridge crossing on Kings Road, was far happier.He said: “The marathon is brilliant, it brings lots of different people to the town, as it should. It's good for the town.”When asked about whether the bridge had made a difference, he said: “That bridge was a fantastic idea. I didn't campaign for it, but I did complain because nobody could get to us, and one year there it was. It should be there every year.”
Greenpeace activists and supporters at the Total exploration site on Monday. Photo: GreenpeaceSupporters of the environmental organization Greenpeace scaled the boring machine at the site of Denmark’s first ever shale gas exploration site on Monday.According to Greenpeace, some 20 activists crossed the barriers at the exploratory site in the northern Jutland municipality of Dybvad on Monday morning. Four of the protestors climbed to the top of French gas company Total’s 45-metre tall boring machine, while others remained on the ground armed with banners and t-shirts that read “Stop Fracking”.The Frederikshavn City Council approved the exploration and if shale gas is found on the property, the company will then explore the possibility of extracting the shale gas through fracking, the pumping of pressurized, chemical-laden water into underground rock layers.Greenpeace said in a press release that its activists were representing the concerns of the community.“There is a local concern among the population of northern Jutland but also a strong and stubborn fighting spirit to stop the thick-headed plan to have Denmark be a testing ground for Total’s gamble with drinking water and nature,” Greenpeace activist Helene Hansen said.“Total’s plan to pump chemicals into the Danish underground can pollute something that we should otherwise be very proud of: our clean groundwater that can be tapped directly and unfiltered through the faucet. We should fight to save it,” Hansen added.Greenpeace points out that Total, which is the fifth largest international energy company, is banned from fracking in its home country of France, which outlawed the practice in 2011. Fracking is also banned in Scotland, Bulgaria and in the US states of New York and Maryland as well as numerous US cities. Legislators in Germany are currently considering the country’s first law on fracking
Two Thai charter airlines already under the microscope for safety concerns cancelled overseas flights Saturday because of their own operational failings, not because Japan didn’t approve them.Asian Air and NokScoot stranded 600 passengers when they respectively cancelled flights to Sapporo and Tokyo. The carriers initially blamed delays in approving the flights by the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau.However, Department of Civil Aviation director-general Somchai Phiphutthawat said Monday that the flights were called off because the carriers either didn't have an aircraft available or could not meet International Civil Aviation Organization standards for pilot service time."On April 4 and 5, officials from the department conducted regular checks on the standards of Asian Air and found that the flight hours of some pilots and co-pilots breached safety standards, as they had not enough rest time," Mr Somchai said. "Pilots flew continuously without a break and that was considered highly dangerous."He said Asian Air could not find replacement pilots in time for the Saturday flight from Bangkok to Sapporo.Meanwhile, NokScoot could not get its plane and crew to Bangkok in time for its flight to Tokyo's Narita airport. NokScoot, a venture between Thailand's Nok Air and Singapore's Scoot Pte, planned to deploy a plane from its parent's home base at Changi International Airport, but could not do so in time.The widely reported incidents greatly impacted passengers and travel agents and further dampened confidence Thailand's beleaguered aviation system.In response, authorities held an urgent meeting on Monday with representatives from Thai-registered airlines operating to Japan, Mr Somchai said. Present were executives from NokScoot, Asian Air, Thai Airways International, Jet Asia Airways and Asia Atlantic Airlines.Mr Somchai said that the airlines were told to prepare their flights better to prevent future cancellations. If they failed to do so, the DCA would suspend or even terminate their licences, he said. His department is also considering imposing fines for such failures.Mr Somchai dismissed concerns by THAI executives that its flights could be delayed overseas because foreign authorities might have to check their planes thoroughly due to the DCA's failure to meet the ICAO's standards for air-transport certification.Mr Somchai said that if THAI services were already of internationally recognised quality, such checks would finish quickly and could be completed within the normal gate time of 90 minutes.

Johannesburg - Eight men, allegedly on their way to rob a business were arrested in Diepkloof, Soweto, on Sunday after police cornered them, seizing two pistols and metro police uniforms.Police acted on crime intelligence, and the suspected robbers, in four cars, were cornered in Immink Drive soon after they left the house where they stay.“Police got information that the suspects were going to business premises to cut the safe and get the money,” Gauteng police spokesman Lieutenant Kay Makhubela said.Equipment, including a ladder, jack hammer, a steel grinder and other tools were recovered from the vehicles - a Toyota Yaris, BMW X5, Isuzu double cab and Volkswagen minibus kombi.Metro police and metrorail reflective vests and badges were also seized and four registration plates believed to be false were also taken from the cars.It was not known whether the cars and firearms were stolen. Makhubela confirmed that one of the pistols had its serial number filed off and that some of the cars were registered in the suspects’ names.“Some of the suspects are out on bail for other cases. They are well known to the police,” he said.More than 200 people gathered along the tape cordoning off the scene in the adjacent park, while others hung over walls, undeterred by sporadic rain showers, as the suspects lay handcuffed and face-down on the road.A spaza shop owner, whose shop fell within the cordoned off area, complained that he was not getting customers.About 15 marked cars from the Flying Squad and the Gauteng Traffic Police’s saturation unit surrounded the scene.Makhubela said police would investigate whether this matter was related to one in which a former Bafana Bafana player and nine others were arrested for planning to rob a truck carrying cigarettes. The men were found with two metro police uniforms.The eight are to appear in the Protea Magistrate’s Court soon.In unrelated crimes, national police spokesman Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said police had seized eight illegal firearms and arrested eight suspects at the weekend.The firearms were recovered in Joburg’s CBD, Hillbrow, Kagiso, Bekkersdal, Springs informal settlement, Germiston, Loate and Tembisa. The suspects were expected to appear in magistrates courts in various districts on Monday.Dlamini asked communities to pass on illegal firearm-related information to the police.

Another senior executive is leaving listed retail group Halfords just a few months after the departure of its chief executive was announced.Chief financial officer Andrew Findlay will step down from the role with the Redditch-based bike and car accessories group in October to join easyJet as a director and CFO.Halfords said it had started the process of looking for his replacement.In January, it was announced that chief executive Matt Davies was joining Tesco as head of its UK and Ireland operation, to be replaced by Jill McDonald in May.Chairman Dennis Millard said today: "We would like to thank Andrew for his outstanding contribution to the business."He has played an important role in the recent Halfords story (and) will be leaving in a healthy financial position and with an award-winning finance team."Mr Findlay added: "I have greatly enjoyed my time with Halfords and I am exceptionally proud of the progress the business has made over the last few years."I am sad to be leaving but the opportunity to join easyJet was too attractive to turn down."As a result, the time has come to let someone else take on the role of CFO in this fantastic business. I wish Halfords and the team every success."
The number of passengers travelling from Glasgow and Edinburgh airports showed a large increase in March.Glasgow reported 606,117 people travelling through the airport last month, a 14% increase on the same period in 2014.For Glasgow it was the airport's 25th consecutive month of growth and its busiest March in seven years.

Has the love affair fizzled out? Or is it still very much on?Here you can find out whether London-based author Paul Breen has decided to keep his relationship with Middlesbrough going - and what his other half Sarah felt about the whole thing!Paul originally hit the headlines when he wrote a passionate blog about his visit to Middlesbrough cheering on Charlton Athletic at the Riverside Stadium.It was a big hit with Gazette readers, so here we have picked out five highlights from the 42-year-old’s second blog post about the town.You can read the post in its entirety here.I’m sure you know that feeling of going on a second date – the sense that everything’s bound to be different to the last time now that the fascination has worn off.Well if that wasn’t bad enough, I was bringing the wife with me this time to meet the mistress who I’d written about one Sunday after my first visit to the side of the Tees.On Saturday, March 28, I left London once again for a trip that this time would last a whole weekend rather than the single day of a football match – wondering what my wife would make of this place that I and then the local papers had painted as her potential love rival.Getting into the station, the omens were good – finding myself greeted by a giant heart on the opposite side of the platform, a big red balloon that seemed to have floated out of a song from the 80s.Set against the iconic figure of the Transporter Bridge, this image rose up against a background of moonlight and the town’s silhouette, as imagined by local artist Mackenzie Thorpe.What a romantic gesture I thought – the town putting up a giant Heart of the North to show that our feelings were mutual.I was hungry and stopped off in the Hudson Quay brasserie where the views are almost as good as the food – and that says a great deal for the quality of the cuisine.Paul Breen with his wife Sarah at Brasserie Hudson Quay.There’s something about the waterfront that reminds me of modern day Woolwich, and indeed the bridge does the same function as the famous Woolwich ferry that away supporters sometimes use on route to the Valley, home of Charlton Athletic, my local club.Again, sitting in lovely surroundings, looking out on fine exhibitions of sculpture combined with traces of past industry and future hopes for education in the shape of the sparkly new 6th form College, I was quite taken with the town on this sunny spring afternoon.Tasting my first beer in Middlesbrough too, as my wife Sarah had a wine, I raised a glass to my mistress.Moving through the rooms, you’re almost crossing continents with Captain Cook on his voyages of discovery, in his conquest of Canada from 1758 to 1763, and then his three great expeditions between 1768 and 1779.You see the animals and icebergs he encountered along the way, and almost feel as if you’re back there for the couple of hours you could spend moving through the rooms of this museum.There’s no doubt this is a hidden jewel of Middlesbrough, the kind of place that many visitors probably stumble upon in the way that Cook himself stumbled across so many places and in particular Australia.I’d personally say that this has the potential to be for Middlesbrough what the Titanic Museum is for Belfast – and it took them almost a hundred years in Northern Ireland to realise the potential of that!So that brought an end to the second date and it was even better than the first, with the added bonus of giving my wife a sense of the town as well. However I do get a real sense that we are meeting Middlesbrough in her bridesmaid years, much as if we’d gone to Belfast in the 1990s at the outset of that city’s regeneration.There’s nothing to stop Middlesbrough from being a city and then benefiting from the tourist potential that this opens up.Looking out the window of The Thistle Hotel on our evenings there, I was often struck by how interesting the view is, much like the working parts of the Thames River in London.Facing out on the sculptures and the industrial backdrop to the Riverside stadium, I could see lots of regeneration work taking place at the same time as preserving the town’s character in a way that Mackenzie Thorpe has also tried to capture in his posters at the station.They were the last thing I saw on my departure from Middlesbrough station on the Tuesday morning, acting both as an expression of greeting and an expression of goodbye – two things at once – good art on the surface and a deeper story beneath.I’m glad to have a got a deeper sense of Middlesbrough these past couple of months and hope that other tourists and visitors get to do the same at some stage.
Wasps kept their hunt for an automatic European Champions Cup spot next season alive at the Kassam Stadium but director of rugby Dai Young insists his troops must improve if they are to stay on course.With London Welsh already confirmed to finish bottom of the Aviva Premiership, most expected Wasps to run away with the game as they look to secure a top-six finish and with it a place in next season’s premier European competition.But moments after half-time the hosts only trailed by four points as a Tristan Roberts penalty and an Opeti Fonua try kept the Exiles in the game after two Tom Varndell scores.However, the visitors bucked their ideas up and Ashley Johnson dotted down before Varndell wrapped up his hat-trick.Chris Elder then replied for London Welsh but Wasps replied with late scores for Sailosi Tagicakibau and Alapati Leiua to secure maximum points, although Young was far from satisfied with the 40-13 win.“The performance was not anywhere near what we expect or what we set ourselves,” he said.“I suppose at the end of the day we’ve come away with five points and no injuries, so we are pleased with that.“But with performances like this we are not going to win too many games, so we need to improve.“We were on a hiding to nothing here really. If you win by a large margin people expect it. We scored 40 points but I still don’t think the performance was anywhere near what we’d expect from ourselves.“Next up we have Exeter, and we all know how well they’ve been playing, with another good win against Northampton.“After that we have Leicester Tigers, so two massive games on the way that could either cement us in the top six or put us under pressure.”As for London Welsh head coach Rowland Phillips, he could not have been happier with the way his side fought against Wasps.“The score did not reflect our performance in that game, or our contribution to the game,” Phillips said.“I thought, as a team, we were competitive, created opportunities and defended well. People will find that hard to believe when you’ve conceded 40 points but anyone who watched the game will see we contained whatever Wasps threw at us.“We didn’t get out of the game what we could have.

Billingham's Joe Clark, pictured on the left with his playing partner Alex RamsdenTeenage table tennis ace Joe Clark returned from the Austria Sparkasse Youth Championships with a silver medal.The 14-year-old from Billingham, playing alongside Alex Ramsden, reached the final of the Cadet Team competition at the tournament, which attracts youngsters from around the world, representing either club or national teams.Representing North Westfield in the Cadet Boys’ Team event, comprising singles and doubles matches, the duo won all three group matches 3-0 against CTT Blonay, Linz Ag Froschberg and Luxembourg 2.That put them into the championship group stages, and they continued their good form by beating Swiss Table Tennis 3-1 and SV Schott and AC Boulogne Billancourt 2, both 3-0.In the positional play-offs, they saw off TSV Schwabhausen 3-1 and AC Boulogne Billancourt 1 3-1 to advance to the final, only to fall just short against Moselle, losing 3-2.In the Cadet Boys’ Singles, Clark made it through the group stage and early rounds to reach the last 16, where he lost to Ilyes Berrichi of AC Boulogne Billancourt 1-3 (11-9, 9-11, 7-11, 8-11).Also in action at the event in Linz was Holly Williams of Stockton, representing ‘Swerve’, alongside Isabelle Joubeily.They advanced from the group stage of the Cadet Girls’ Team event with two victories and one defeat, but lost both matches in the Championship group stage, eventually ending in 10th place after the positional play-offs.
Former Minister of State for Trade and Industries, Dr Samuel Ortom of the All Progressive Congress (APC), has won the Benue governorship election held on Saturday.Announcing the results on Monday in Makurdi, the Returning Officer for the state, Prof. Istifinus Dafwang, said Ortom polled 422,932 votes to beat seven other contestants.NAN reports that Labour Party, PDP, APC, APGA, NNPP, APA, ACPN and SDP contested in the Governorship and State Assembly elections.The results showed that Ortoms’s closest rival in the contest, Mr Terhemen Tarzoor of the PDP scored 313,878 votes, while Mr Caleb Abahnif of APGA had 649 votes, Mr Boniface Umele of ACPN polled 1,431 votes.Others were, Mr Oglekwu Shadrack of APA, who polled 1,595 votes, William Ligom of the LP with 2,653, Helene Ode of NNPP scored 767 votes and Samuel Gar of SDP polled 589 votes.The results, however, showed that the PDP would retain its dominance in the state legislature, having won a total of 15 seats as against 14 by the APC and one by the Labour Party.Reacting to the results, Prof Iyorwuese Hagher, who served as the Director General of Tarzoor Campaign Organization, congratulated the winner of the election.He appealed to the people to support the newly elected governor to succeed in the task of rebuilding the state.Hagher, however, expressed some misgivings in the manner the polls were held, but the party had accepted the result in the “spirit of greater Benue state.”“We prefer to move forward and forget the indiscretions of the INEC returning officer,” he added.He promised that the PDP in the state would be strengthened, as it had “grown lean from divisive politics.”NAN recalls that the APC had won two out of the three senatorial seats and a majority of the federal constituencies in the state.
The defeated governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Terhemen Tarzoor has congratulated the governor-elect, Chief Samuel Ortom of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for his emergence as governor.  Tarzoor said his loss in the governorship does not in anyway mean he is rejected by the people but rather, he stated that Ortom’s victory is a new wind of change that is blowing through the nation.A statement signed by the Director General of Tarzoor/Ngbede campaign organization, Prof. Iyorwuese Hagher said Tarzoor had earlier called Ortom by telephone to salute him over the victory well deserved.It said, “Rt. Terhemen Tarzor sends his congratulations to Chief Samuel Ortom and the APC over the victory at the polls.  It further said  “Tarzoor has reservations concerning the conduct of the elections by INEC commissioner, Istafanus Dafwang, but in the spirit of the greater Benue State, prefers that we move forward.”“Rather he (Tarzoor) considers the election results as a new wind of change that is blowing through the nation and making serious demands on leaders to live up to the true calling of leadership as people who must give sovereignty, respect and dignity to the people,” It stated.

BERLIN — The Porsche and Piech families that control Volkswagen, Europe’s biggest automotive group, are battling over the future leadership of the company as CE Martin Winterkorn vowed to resist efforts to oust him.The leadership crisis erupted on Friday, when Ferdinand Piech, chairman and grandson of the inventor of the Beetle, suggested that he had lost confidence in Mr Winterkorn. Mr Piech said in comments to Spiegel Online, the website of the German news magazine, that he is "at a distance to Winterkorn," igniting speculation that he was seeking the CEO’s ouster.On Sunday, it became clear that Mr Piech’s opinion isn’t shared by his cousin Wolfgang Porsche, chairman of Porsche, the holding company that controls 50.7% of VW’s voting stock."Dr Piech represents his private opinion," Mr Porsche said in a statement."Content and facts have not been co-ordinated with the family." Mr Piech didn’t respond to requests for comment.Supporters of Mr Winterkorn defend his record, saying he has boosted sales and profit and expanded VW’s global footprint, creating a global automotive powerhouse that is set to overtake Toyota Motor and General Motors as the world’s largest car group by sales. But low profit margins forced Mr Winterkorn to launch a global cost-cutting programme, while his bet to build a new factory in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to revive the company’s US business hasn’t paid off.Mr Winterkorn was the protégé of Mr Piech. When Mr Piech was CEO of VW’s luxury brand Audi, he made Mr Winterkorn technical director.Later, when Mr Piech became CEO of Volkswagen, he made Mr Winterkorn CEO of Audi and set the stage for him to become CEO of the Volkswagen group in 2007. It was widely believed that the Porsche and Piech families had agreed that Mr Winterkorn, who is 67 years old, would become the chairman of the nonexecutive supervisory board, when current chairman Mr Piech, who is 77 years old, retires, which he is expected to do in 2017. That scenario now seems to be in question.Together, the Porsche and Piech families hold five of the 20 seats on the supervisory board and have agreed to vote with one voice."My understanding was that within the family there was an agreement that Winterkorn should become the chairman of the supervisory board; now it seems unclear," one person familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal.Mr Piech is known for making cryptic comments that appear aimed at undermining executives who have lost favour with the Volkswagen patriarch.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in 2006, he said the future of Bernd Pitschetsrieder, CEO at the time, was completely open. Mr Pitschetsrieder was replaced by Mr Winterkorn a few months later. Because of this history, supporters rushed to Mr Winterkorn’s defence, pointing out that since he took the helm in 2007, unit sales rose 77% to 10.2-million vehicles last year, revenue surged 92% to €202bn and net profit tripled to €10.8bn."Why should we want to end such a success story without any valid reason?" said a person close to the CEO.Aware of the potential weight of Mr Piech’s comments, people close to Mr Winterkorn say they were stunned and caught off guard."Everybody is very surprised. No one understands what his intentions are," said the person familiar with the situation. Mr Winterkorn has declined to comment, but people close to him say he is determined to stay on until the end of his contract in 2016."For him, it is business as usual," said a person close to Mr Winterkorn.Without the backing of the Porsche family, Mr Piech appears completely isolated. Mr Winterkorn also has the support of two major power blocs on the board: labour and the state of Lower Saxony.Stephan Weil, premier of Lower Saxony, said at the weekend that he was "unpleasantly surprised" by Mr Piech’s comments.Bernd Osterloh, the powerful head of VW’s works council and deputy chairman of the supervisory board, said under Mr Winterkorn’s leadership VW has experienced a "success story that is without precedent," adding: "If it was up to us, his contract would be extended beyond 2016."More Africa news from The Wall Street JournalMore news from The Wall Street Journal
Washington - Employers plan to hire 8.3 percent more new college graduates from the Class of 2015 for their US operations than they did from the Class of 2014, according to a recent jobs outlook report from the National Association of Colleges and Employers.With this statistic and other positive employment projections in the news, the job market for new college graduates appears to be the best it's been since the start of the Great Recession.But even with this increase in potential jobs, how do new college graduates ensure they are properly prepared for their first big interview? Here we offer some practical tips for new graduates to help them enter the workforce by being polished, professional and ready to outclass the competition.Two of the most important communications skills to help make a lasting first impression are also the easiest - eye contact and firm handshakes. Because of the constant need to stay in touch, a majority of younger people grew up continuously monitoring their mobile devices. Even in formal settings, it's amazing to watch so many people looking at their phones instead of having face-to-face conversations.But not being able to make solid eye contact with a potential employer sends a message that can be interpreted as boredom, disinterest and a lack of trust on behalf of a potential candidate. The same is true of a limp handshake.Conversely, a firm handshake implies confidence, collaboration and a willingness to get down to work. In every interview, college graduates should master these basic interpersonal skills that say you are the right man or woman for the job.With more employers routinely checking out the online presence of a potential job candidate, a digital footprint can come back to haunt someone more than ever. That's why serious graduates need to think twice before posting that picture of winning a beer pong championship on social media.Whether it's removing any potential image challenging pictures and inflammatory posts or whether it's simply changing your account settings to private, college graduates need to think of themselves as a brand and always present the best image on all social platforms.More and more companies are conducting interviews at lunches, dinners or in other off-site locales. But be aware that these seemingly less formal interviews are often used as a barometer to observe how a job candidate handles his or herself in a social setting.This is where elbows should never meet white tablecloths, where closed-mouth chewing will be noted, and where a mobile phone should never be seen or heard. Also, make sure you never make this most common dining faux pas - snagging the roll of a dining partner. Always remember BMW - your BREAD is on the left, your MEAL is in the middle and your WATER is on the right.Recently a colleague told a story of a job prospect sending an interview query about an open position. The candidate noted how, after exhaustive research into their company, he realised he was the perfect fit for them. The only problem? The query letter was addressed to one of the prospect's main competitors, indicating a multiple cut and paste approach in creating a “personal” cover letter.Graduates, be warned. Take the time to tailor your correspondence to the company where you truly feel you'd like to be employed. And ensure your correspondence is grammatically correct and properly proofed.Whether you are thanking your grandmother for the graduation cheque or sending a note of gratitude to a potential employer for a recent job interview, take the time to say thanks in a handwritten and timely card.

Building work has been delayed on the site of 14 new homes in Surrey after excavations uncovered 85 human skeletons.Archaeologists believe the bones found in Station Road, Godalming are from a Christian burial ground used between the 9th and 13th centuries.They will be removed and reinterred at a nearby church.More excavations are now to take place on land which will eventually become gardens and a car park.It was originally believed 50-60 skeletons would be discovered on the site, which was part of a burial ground for the Church of St Peter and St Paul.Building work had been expected to start last year.The Ministry of Justice has granted a licence for the additional excavations, with Waverley Borough Council agreeing to spend £227,000 on the work.
Mitch Honeychurch has earned an AFL Rising Star nomination for his first game at the MCG, the Western Bulldogs' upset win over Richmond in round two.Honeychurch booted a goal, laid six tackles and tallied 18 possessions in the Bulldogs' 19-point triumph last Saturday."Mitch is becoming an integral part of a midfield/forward group that will continue to drive the team into the future," Bulldogs coach Luke Beveridge said of Honeychurch.The 20-year-old played three games in 2014, his debut season.
A Queensland man has been accused of sexually abusing 28 children from three states, including taking some of his victims to hotel rooms where he allegedly raped them.The 47-year-old, from the town of Warwick southwest of Brisbane, is facing 145 child exploitation charges, including making a child abuse film and distributing child exploitation material.So far 28 victims have been identified from Queensland, NSW and Victoria, but police believe there may be others as far away as Western Australia.Police allege the man used a range of social media sites to prey on children and in some cases arrange meetings so he could physically abuse them and use them to make child pornography.In other instances, he's accused of resorting to extortion to force his victims to send him indecent images or offering them money to do so.The man faces five charges of rape, four counts of indecent treatment of children under 16, and eight counts of grooming child under 16 with intent to procure engagement in a sexual act.He is also charged with 20 counts of involving children in making child exploitation material, 11 of making child exploitation material, two of making a child abuse film, and one of distributing child exploitation material.He will appear in the Warwick Magistrates Court on Monday.Police say investigations are continuing and they want to hear from anyone who may have had contact with a man using the names Jazz, Jazzman and David Bourne on social media sites.

Get transported tomorrow to Raglan open home in a SealegsThe Waikato costal settlement of Raglan is hosting an open home with a difference this Sunday. Interested people will get a free ride in a Sealegs amphibious marine craft worth over $100,000.What’s more the Sealegs will be gifted to the lucky person who buys the large home and property overlooking the Raglan harbour which is for sale at $1.1 million.People attending the open home on Sunday 12 April from 11am to 2pm can catch the Sealegs from the Raglan town centre which will run a regular ferry service across the harbour during that time. For anyone flying in from out of town, Sealegs will also pick them up from the airport to be arranged by local Century 21 agent George Barton.Geoff Barnett, National Manager of Century 21 New Zealand, says throwing in the Sealegs as part of the sales package makes sense as it dramatically improves access and appeal of the property. Alternative road access takes about an hour.Marketed by Century 21 agent George Barton, the large and relatively new three bedroom two storey home sits among six acres of bush and overlooks the Raglan township and harbour. It boasts its own private deep water anchorage.The 604 Te Akau Wharf Road property at Raglan comes with a CV of $960,000, with a standard package for a brand new Sealegs 6.1R worth over $100,000 on top of that. The total cost is being marketed at $1.1m.
The ridiculous clip starts by showing a masked man dressed in camouflage boasting about how they stole the vault.Speaking in Russian, he tells the camera: saying: "We devastated all the Ukies (Ukrainians) around here and we took away a whole safe with lots of dough in it."There are probably around 20 million UAH (£500,000)."Now we have the safe and will try to blow it up because we couldn’t open it any other way."

German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has called on Russia and Ukraine to set in motion the next phase of the shaky Minsk peace accords aimed at stopping the fighting in east Ukraine, ahead of talks about their implementation in Berlin on Monday."We expect both Moscow and Kiev to seize the central issue of the implementation of the next phase of Minsk," Steinmeier said in an interview in Monday's edition of Die Welt newspaper.The next phase foresees "the preparation of local elections in the areas occupied by the separatists, but also humanitarian access and reconstruction in eastern Ukraine," Steinmeier said.The German minister will host his counterparts from Ukraine, Russia and France in Berlin on Monday to study the implementation of the Minsk accords that have stopped much of the fighting despite frequent violations.Steinmeier said progress had been made, pointing to the "well-advanced withdrawal of heavy weapons".An unnamed NATO official told another newspaper, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, on Sunday that Russia was still supplying troops and weapons to the separatists in Ukraine, in violation of the Minsk accords.Steinmeier said observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), who are operating in east Ukraine, were making progress, "but it is not enough".The OSCE this week demanded that both the pro-Russian separatists and the regular Ukrainian army stop intimidating or restricting the movements of its 400 monitors.The results of the talks in Berlin will be discussed at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Luebeck, Germany, on Tuesday and Wednesday.
President Barack Obama will huddle with Iraq's prime minister at the White House on Tuesday to plot crucial next steps in what US officials admit will be a long fight to defeat the Islamic State.Obama will host Haider al-Abadi and try to forge a strategy to snatch back swaths of territory lost to jihadist fighters, after Iraqi forces' tough victory in Tikrit.Even with the help of Iranian-backed Shiite militia, Iraq's crisis-ravaged military was unable to wrest control of the city without substantial US airstrikes to soften the ground.A senior US official described the offensive in turn as "very difficult," and "a bit of a rollercoaster."It was also a reality check for those who hoped that Baghdad was poised to seize back territory relinquished in northern and central Iraq last year.Tikrit had been seen as a dress rehearsal for Abadi's much-touted "Spring offensive" to dislodge jihadist fighters from the vital oil hub of Mosul.Washington now says that attack "needs to happen when it's ready to happen" and "shouldn't be on a fixed timetable but rather when all the ducks are in a row.""It's going to take a lot of capacity, which is going to take time to build," said one official.Obama has deep political as well as security interests in making sure Iraqi forces succeed.Critics say his drawdown of US troops in Iraq was a strategic blunder that allowed the Islamic State to flourish.Washington is now putting much hope in Abadi and his willingness to engage Iraq's regional, tribal and factional leaders in the fight."The Abadi government is different in nearly every fundamental respect from the previous government," said one official."It is important to recall just how serious that crisis was" when Nouri Al-Maliki was in power, he said."The future of Baghdad was very much in doubt," as Islamic State fighters closed in on the capital, the official added.But Abadi's regional outreach has created some uneasy bedfellows for Washington.In Tikrit, "when the operation unfolded, it was heavily influenced by Shia militia volunteers," said another senior US administration official.Their chain of command sometimes ran through Tehran rather than Baghdad.Increasingly, the White House suggests that the next step should come in Sunni-dominated Anbar, rather than Mosul.That could preclude deep involvement by the Shiite militia -- for fear of stoking sectarian conflict. And if the militias sit out the next round it may also stall Iran's rising influence.Whatever the strategy, victory and stability are unlikely to come quickly.After 1,800 US coalition airstrikes, just 25 percent of territory lost to the Islamic State last year has been regained.The use of US ground forces has not been ruled out."This is a long-term campaign," said one official."It is going to be a long, long, long haul, I cannot overemphasize that."
The question of the Liberal leadership could be revisited in months as support for Tony Abbott's government drifts south again, with Australians signalling they are not convinced by the sudden switch to "fairness" and the promise of a routine second budget.With that budget just 4 weeks away and attention in national politics focused squarely on the economic sphere, Mr Abbott's woes appear linked to the sinking popularity of his Treasurer Joe Hockey, who as architect of the first politically toxic blueprint, has suffered a massive 45 per cent reversal in his approval rating over the last 13 months from plus 20 per cent in March 2014 to minus 25 now.The morale blow for the government comes as the Fairfax-Ipsos poll for April, found 6 out of 10 voters (58 per cent) say they still want the budget deficit addressed as a "high priority" and a growing number favour an increase in the 10 per cent goods and services tax to help balance the books.And while half of those polled said they wanted superannuation tax rules left alone, 43 per cent now back changes that could see the generous concessional taxation rate of 15 per cent on superannuation contributions for middle and higher income earners doubled.More than a third of respondents, at 37 per cent, say they support an increase to the rate of the GST - up 7 percentage points in a year despite neither party proposing it.The result is a repudiation of Mr Abbott's barnacle-scraping efforts to rid the government of tough policies seen as "unfair" and his rhetorical switch from fiscal hardliner to a softly-softly approach to budget repair. Voters appear to have taken a second look since the Prime Minister narrowly saw off a spill motion in February, and decided they still do not like what they see.Bill Shorten's Labor opposition has opened up an eight-point buffer on two-party-preferred voting intention of 54 per cent to the Coalition on 46 per cent - a three-point deterioration for the government since last month's survey, which suggested Mr Abbott's government was making a comeback and was almost level-pegging with Labor at 49-51.The eight-point gap in the nationwide telephone poll of 1404 people taken between April 9-11, is based on preference allocations from the last federal election. However, it widens further to 10 points (55/45) when respondents were asked where they would direct their second preference if an election were held now.The government's primary vote - where voters would place their first preference - has again fallen below 40 to be on 39 per cent with Labor on 38. That's a two-point gain for Labor and three-point drop for the Coalition in the poll, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.6 per cent. The Coalition's primary vote had been at 44 per cent in March of 2014 and was an extremely healthy 46 per cent at the last election.Based on its share of the vote at the election in 2013 of 46.5 per cent, Labor's current rating of 54 per cent (two-party preferred) represents a swing of 7.5 per cent which, if carried through to the election, and applied uniformly, would see an electoral wipe-out of the government, with as many as 36 seats falling.Mr Abbott's approval rating has improved marginally to be minus-26 per cent but it has come off a very low base having been minus-28 in March. The figure comes from the percentage approving of his performance (34 per cent), minus those who disapprove (60 per cent).Despite his party's rise, Mr Shorten's net approval rating has dropped fractionally to be minus 2 per cent - it had been at zero last month (43/43).On the head-to-head comparison of which leader is the preferred prime minister, Mr Shorten leads Mr Abbott comfortably at 46 per cent (up 2 since March) to 38 per cent (down 1 since March).The government's downturn also follows a series of announcements on national security, the release of the long-awaited Inter-generational Report into the budget over the next four decades, and the commencement of a new white paper process on tax reform.Yet for all Mr Hockey's unpopularity and the apparent negative impact on Mr Abbott's standing, voters still say the Coalition is the better economic manager at 41 per cent to Labor's 32 and the Greens' share of just 3 per cent.Even among Coalition voters, Mr Hockey is given a fail mark by a third of respondents at 32 per cent although 60 per cent approve of his performance.Pollster Jessica Elgood noted that more than half of Greens supporters believe returning the budget to surplus is a low priority and 39 per cent rate it as a high priority but Labor voters are more evenly split at 47/46.However, Coalition voters are more bullish on fiscal repair with 8 out of 10 (78  per cent) rating the priority as high.At approval ratings of minus 26 and minus 25 respectively, Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey are equally unpopular, reinforcing a view within the Liberal party-room that a change in leadership would be a 2-for-1 deal resulting in Mr Hockey's removal as well. Proponents of that move say that would clear the way for a new economic narrative and a new advocate in the crucial treasury post, most likely, the current social Services Minister, Scott Morrison.

Applying the GST to small purchases of goods from overseas sites could bring in $400 million to government coffers with the price of clothes and electronics bought online the heaviest hit, analysts say.The Abbott government wants to slap GST on offshore online sales. Federal Treasurer Joe Hockey and state treasurers last week agreed to impose GST on downloaded music, movies and books, making them more expensive for consumers but bringing in extra federal revenue. The $1000 GST-free threshold for imports could also be lowered.Retailers such as Harvey Norman boss Gerry Harvey and Solomon Lew have long pushed for the government to impose the GST on online sales.Mr Harvey said politicians had finally seen the light after being more concerned about an electoral backlash than the integrity of the tax system.He said the GST threshold meant online retailers had benefited at the expense of bricks and mortar retailers."It's affected department stores and people who sell shoes, or clothes, or handbags, or musical equipment, or sporting goods, all that sort of thing, but not me," he said. "I only ever brought it up because I thought it was wrong and unfair."Mr Harvey also rejected suggestions it would cost more to apply the GST on small offshore purchases online than it would bring in in revenue."All you had to do was find the top 100 people that were sending it in, get onto them all and say, 'charge GST otherwise you can't send anything in'," Mr Harvey said.Under the government's plan, being dubbed the "Netflix tax", a company providing an "intangible service" into Australia would charge GST on those services.Domestic online purchases account for about 75 per cent, or $4.2 billion, of all online purchases in Australia. Adding the GST on them suggests more than $400 million of GST revenue, only if every online purchase comes back to Australia.But if the GST is also applied on services, the total revenue raised could reach billions.Growth in online sales continues to outpace growth at bricks and mortar sores, but has slowed thanks to a weakened Australian dollar and local retailers pouring money into online to fight international rivals.Online sales are estimated to have grown 8.7 per cent in the year to February to $16.7 billion, NAB says.This was the equivalent of 6.9 per cent of spending at traditional bricks and mortar retailers.A 2011 Productivity Commission report found "strong in-principle grounds for reform to promote tax neutrality" but concluded the government should not change the laws unless it was cost-effective.Consumer group Choice said there was "no evidence that lowering the tax would raise net revenue"."Australians already face price premiums of 50 per cent and more compared to overseas consumers for some identical products," it said."The risks are about an approach that might impose significant red tape and collection costs on households, with the only gain being for some local retailers who may be struggling to compete in a global marketplace."Analysts say Australian retailers won't win all that much from a change because price is just one reason for buying from an overseas website; product range and convenience are also key."The crucial factor will be where they drop the threshold to. Many online purchases are $100 and less, even from offshore, so unless they drop the threshold to $100 or less, it may not have much of an impact," one said.

The preferred bidder of Nigerian Telecommunications Limited (NITEL) and its mobile arm (Mtel), NATCOM Consortium, has paid $176,575,700 (N29,696,469,600) — being the outstanding 70 percent of the $252,521,000 bid price for the acquisition of the assets and business units of the enterprises.A statement by the Head, Public Communications, BPE, Chigbo Anichebe said the company paid the 70 percent balance on Thursday, April 2nd, 2015, four days ahead of the April 7, 2015 deadline for payment.Recall that NATCOM had on January 6, 2015 paid $75,756,300 (N12, 727,058,400) being 30 percent of the bid price in line with the offer letter by the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE) which mandated NATCOM to make an initial deposit of 30 percent of the bid price not later than 14 days from the date of the offer letter.With the earlier 30 percent payment, NATCOM was expected to pay the remaining balance of 70 percent of the bid price within 90 days which was to expire on April 6, 2015 but due to the public holiday arising from the Easter celebration, the deadline was extended to Tuesday, April 7, 2015.It would be recalled that the National Council on Privatization (NCP), at its meeting of February 27, 2012, approved the privatization of Nigerian Telecommunications Plc (NITEL) and Nigerian Mobile Telecommunication (MTEL) through “guided liquidation”.The strategy was adopted by the Council after due consideration of other options and in light of the previous failed attempts to privatize NITEL and MTEL through Strategic Core Investor Sale and Negotiated Sale strategies and the huge liabilities to creditors to the tune of over N300 billion.Under the guided liquidation strategy, all the core assets and business undertakings of NITEL and MTEL were to be sold a qualified bidder by the Liquidator under the general guidance of the National Council on Privatization.Thus, the bidder that acquires the assets of NITEL and MTEL will pledge to continue to operate the assets to provide telecoms services. This is as against the traditional liquidation of an enterprise by assets stripping.Consequently, advertisements for submission of Expressions of Interest (EOIs) from prospective bidders for the acquisition of the assets and business undertakings of NITEL and MTEL were placed in both local and international print media by the Liquidator. At the closing date on June 30, 2014, seventeen (17) organizations/consortia submitted EOIs of which only two satisfactorily met the stipulated criteria for pre-qualification.On September 18, 2014, the two successful applicants, NATCOM Consortium and NETTAG Consortium, that met the minimum pass mark of 75% were pre-qualified and issued the Request for Proposals (RFP) and allowed to proceed to data room and physical due diligence stage prior to preparation and submission of their technical and financial proposals.The deadline for submission of technical and financial bids was Friday, November 7, 2014. The two pre-qualified bidders, NATCOM Consortium and NETTAG Consortium, submitted their technical and financial bids before the expiration of the deadline. The technical bids received from the two bidders were evaluated.Unfortunately, one of the two pre-qualified bidders, NETTAG Consortium, was disqualified for failure to enclose a bid bond as clearly stipulated in the RFP.Following the disqualification of NETTAG Consortium, only the financial bid of NATCOM Consortium qualified for opening on December 3, 2014; having scored an average of 92% in its technical proposal which was above the minimum pass mark of 75%, and had also satisfied the requirement of a valid bid bond.Accordingly, the financial proposal of NATCOM Consortium was publicly opened on Wednesday, December 3, 2014 which it won with a bid price of $252.25m.Consequently, the Consortium, on Monday, December 22, 2014 in Abuja, signed the Assets Sale Agreement and obtained the Offer Letter from the Liquidator of NITEL/MTEL and the Bureau of Public Enterprises (BPE).The companies would be handed over to the NATCOM Consortium after the approval of the National Council on Privatization.
The last may not be heard on the just concluded Abia North senatorial election as a Non Governmental Organisation (NGO), Peace & Media Advocacy Group lashed out on the former Abia State governor, Chief Orji Uzo Kalu over his petition challenging the victory of Hon. Mao Ohuabunwa.In a statement released in Abuja yesterday by the group and signed by Mazi James Okoronkwo and Peter Kalu, National Coordinator and Secretary respectively described Kalu’s petition as unwarranted stating that the former Abia governor was never a candidate in that election.They also wondered why Kalu will be faulting an exercise that was acclaimed to be transparent, peaceful and credible by both international and local observers that monitored March 28 polls in the state.While stating that Kalu’s allegation of irregularities in the election is a figment of his own imagination, they maintained unequivocally that the election was won by Hon. Mao Ohuabunwa in a landslide manner.They berated Kalu for crying more than the bereaved by protesting an election he never took part in, noting that Kalu never took part in that election.Continuing, the group condemned Kalu’s eight years stewardship in Abia State saying it was characterized by corruption and disaster.“We state categorically that Chief Uzor Kalu’s eight years rulership in Abia was disastrous, corrupt and a negation of the ethos of governance and public administration. Abia State under Orji Uzor Kalu was synonymous with graft, abuse of the rule of law, mamaracy) and nepotism.They however, urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) Chairman, Professor Attahiru Jega to disregard the petition given the fact that it was laced with falsehood.“Peace and Media Advocacy Group at this juncture is calling on the INEC Chairman, Proff. Attahiru Jega not to be distracted by the desperate and callous petition by Orji Uzor Kalu as it is riddled with falsehood, innuendos and propaganda carefully crafted to hoodwink and deceive well meaning Abians, the INEC, the general public and other critical stakeholders who have affirmed the transparency and credibility of the of the polls”.According to the group those who lost election had better seek justice in the court instead of faulting a system which has been locally and internationally adjudged to be free, fair and devoid of all forms of malpractices.The NGO also warned the returning officer in the election, Prof Ihekweaba Chukwugoziem who it described as ‘an acolyte and childhood friend’ of Dr Kalu to desist from the campaign of calumny which he has carried out on the ‘smooth process’ that returned Hon Ohuabunwa.
The returning officer for Saturday Kwara State Governorship and House of Assembly elections, Professor Musibau Akanji who is also the Vice-Chancellor of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, has declared Governor Abdulfatah Ahmed of the APC as the winner of the governorship election.Akanji who declared the results at about 8pm in Ilorin at the INEC office disclosed that Governor Ahmed scored 295,832 as against PDP candidate, Senator Simeon Ajibola who scored 115,220 while LP candidate got l 2973 votes.Akanji said since APC has scored highest votes in all LGAs of the state with 25 percent, Governor Ahmed was therefore declared as the winner of the April 11 governorship election.The INEC officials had gone on a three-hour break to accommodate the arrival of collation officers from two remaining local government areas.

The Ottawa police arson unit has deemed Thursday night’s fire in the Glebe, which destroyed an entire commercial building at Bank Street and Fifth Avenue, an arson.While the Ontario fire marshal’s office had confirmed Friday that an explosion occurred at the site, the investigative team — made up of the Ottawa police, the fire marshal’s office and Ottawa fire department — waited until Sunday to officially declare a cause of the fire.Sgt. David Christie of the Ottawa police arson unit said the priority Saturday was to bring in heavy equipment to tear down the exterior walls of the brick building before investigators could move further inside the structure.After removing some of the walls and support beams to avoid collapse, investigators were able to make their way inside. Once inside they will analyze fire patterns, remove debris and take samples.The core of the investigation is around the middle of the complex where the Beaver’s Mug Café and Silver Scissors hair salon sustained most of the damage. Investigators were seen climbing over cables and strewn rubble inside the gutted spaces exposed to the afternoon sun given the roof was torn away in the explosion and blaze.“The fire patterns that are visible obviously just from the street and from inside would indicate there was some sort of explosion,” said Sgt. Christie, who said they are treating the file as a criminal investigation. “What the cause of that was? That’s what we’re working on now to determine if that was an accelerant or some other reason for that.”He said the building will be demolished once the investigation is complete. But how and when will be up to the insurance company.Despite the demolition and investigation going on, shoppers were out on the busy Bank Street strip at Fifth Avenue on Saturday morning.Several passersby stopped to check out the burned out building at the corner of Fifth Avenue.The full scene is exposed to the street in all its sad ugliness: With the front windows blown out, the row of little businesses show their black and twisted insides to anyone walking by. The roof is gone, flooding the inside with daylight.And traffic on Bank Street was steady late Friday as cars squeezed into the west half of the road, just a metre or two from firefighters watching the hot spots that kept flaring up.The curious stood on the sidewalk, taking endless cellphone photos through the cool drizzle. You could pick up the smell almost to Bronson Avenue.The brick outer wall of the structure on the southeast corner of Bank and Fifth Avenue is still standing, but little else is. With the roof gone, many interior walls have collapsed, and some rows of framing lumber lean over, half-fallen.It will be Peter Hamilton’s job to sort all this blackened confusion into a pattern that makes sense, answering the basic question: What started it?He hasn’t begun to answer this yet.“Everything is on the table with respect to how the explosion transpired,” said Hamilton, an investigator from the Ontario Fire Marshal’s office.“We are currently in the process of rendering the scene safe,” he told reporters. “We can confirm that there has been an explosion.”The 911 calls started coming in at 11 p.m. There had been at least one explosion — confirmed by firefighters now — and witnesses say there were others.Fire crews worked through the night, finally bringing the blaze under control around 4:30 a.m., but not before it had gutted a stretch of businesses that included a Mac’s Convenience store, a Silver Scissors hair salon, Brown’s Dry Cleaners, Beaver’s Mug coffee shop, Pizza Hut and Encino Taco Shop.Andrew Peck, executive director of the Glebe Business Improvement Area, awoke in the middle of the night Friday and grabbed his phone to check the final score of the Ottawa Senators game. When he read an email about the fire, he got dressed and ran out the door.When he arrived at the fire scene, directly across from the BIA office on Bank Street, he was shocked by the devastation.“I still smell like smoke,” says Peck, peering out from his office window at the damaged structure across the street. “It looks like a bomb went off.”Kate Burke, who lives on Fifth Avenue just 75 metres from the building, heard the blast around 11 p.m.“I heard a massive explosion and glass shattering,” said Burke, who added that she then heard two men start yelling, “Oh f—, oh f—!”Burke ran to her balcony, where she said she smelled chemicals in the air and saw “smoke everywhere.”Eli Saikaley also raced to Bank Street just before midnight and couldn’t believe what he saw.“I was numb,” Saikaley said Friday after looking at the remains of the Silver Scissors Hair Salon, which he owned with his cousin, Bruce.“We’re the first salon in the Glebe. Thirty-six years.”
HEIDELBERG — It's the everyday triggers that are constant reminders of their youngest son.Last week, the street cleaner went by on their cul-de-sac and Christine Padaric was flooded with memories of her teenage boy outside sweeping the driveway getting the double-car laneway ready for his impromptu skateboard park."He was a skateboard fanatic," she said.For Christine and Klaus Padaric, there is no anniversary date. Instead, this time of the year takes them back to the agonizing week in which they watched their son, a lanky teen with a six-feet-four-inch frame, lifeless in a hospital bed for days.He was taken off life support on April 12.The 17-year-old Heidelberg teen died in a Hamilton hospital six days after he was found unconscious in a bathtub following a party in an Elmira apartment in April 2013.Austin died from an accidental overdose of hydromorphone pills, a narcotic pain reliever that is crushed and snorted by recreational users.Quin Kurtz was charged at that time with drug offences after a search of the apartment turned up marijuana, morphine and magic mushrooms.Kurtz, now 22, faces a charge of manslaughter and criminal negligence causing death. His trial is set to begin in late September.The Padarics last saw their son the day before the Elmira Maple Syrup Festival. He was going to a party Friday and staying overnight.Austin was with people he knew, but not his close school or skateboarding friends. When he began vomiting and was in distress, they placed him in a cold bathtub, thinking he would sleep it off.An ambulance wasn't called until the next morning."Austin had a lot of friends who really cared deeply for him," said his dad. "Had they been there, the outcome could have been different.""I look back on that night and it could have been prevented," said his mother."You are haunted by the what-if's. It can drive you insane," she saidThe stigma associated with drug use and drug overdoses sparked hateful comments by some, calling him a junkie, said Christine."How he died doesn't define him as a person," said his father.The Padarics knew their son smoked pot. Christine thought he smoked too much and told him so. They talked about prescription pills and he knew the consequences, she said."He was a risk taker," she said.It's not the drug pusher waiting outside the school who will influence your kids, said Klaus."It's people they know or they think they know. It's not a student and drug dealer relationship," he said.In addition, teens underestimate the power of addiction, said Christine."I've got an exam so I need to get high," said Christine, referring to teenagers justifying pot smoking to calm their anxiety.The Padarics want other teens to know that they're not invincible."Accidents happen. Surround yourself with good people," she said. "I don't want to see any parent go through this."Elmira District Secondary School Principal Paul Morgan received calls from residents, workers at community agencies and concerned parents wanting to support the school but also looking for direction to ensure such a tragedy would never happened again.A drug strategy committee was created and Christine Padaric became a member of the group.Two male students approached Morgan seeking his help in reminding their peers to watch out for each other.The idea of a lanyard developed and all students were given a lanyard this year with each grade representing a different colour. It reads: EDSS — Together we graduate.With the help of a public health nurse, students in Grade 9 and Grade 12 have received training on what to do in case of an overdose."We want our students to look after each other," said Morgan. "We want to help students get through high school. School is a big influence on their lives and we hope we can give them strategies."Public health nurse Kathy McKenna said students are receptive and engaged. They want to be able to identify the signs of drug overdose and ultimately save their friends if they have to, she said."We are not here to promote substance use but we are meeting youth where they are at in terms of substance use," she said."If you are going to use, use safely," McKenna said."The one thing I say is 'if you learn anything today, be aware and listen to your inner voice. Do not hesitate to call for help."Since Austin's death, Christine has spoken to community groups and students in schools about drug use and how a night of hanging out with friends can go terribly wrong."I became vocal. I was never secretive about it (Austin's death). It had to be known," she said. "If it happened to me, it could happen to anyone."The Padarics' eldest son, Kurt, 23, who now lives in Banff, has also spoken to students and shared what it's like to lose a brother.To a virtual classroom in Huntsville, Christine recently told the students to have a plan when they see someone in distress and not to be fearful to call 911."It's OK to call 911. You won't get in trouble," she said.She'd like to see drug overdose training in school curriculum so all students are aware of the symptoms and can save their friends if they are in distress."It's a new world. Drugs are a reality and part of everyday life. Education is power," she said.Christine hopes to start a Waterloo chapter of Grief Recovery After a Substance Passing (GRASP), a support group for those dealing with the death of a child by drugs or alcohol."I have a belief that things happen for a reason," she said. "He wasn't meant to have a long life. I'm really proud of his legacy."
The shark tore off the boy’s limbs and part of his stomach as he was surfing early on Sunday morning in an off-limits section of sea off the west coast of the island.Elio Canestri was attacked while surfing with seven others, the Mirror reports. He was around 15 metres offshore.A spokesman for the rescue services told the Mirror: “A boat was launched very quickly, and the victim was dragged out of the sea, but he died from his wounds.“Those who witnessed the attack, including other children, are being treated for trauma.”It was the 16th shark attack on the island since 2011 and the seventh loss of life.Reunion island authorities are said to be scrambling to find solutions to protect swimmers.In July 2012, a surfer died after a shark ripped off his leg and, in July 2013, a teenage girl was bitten in half as she swam metres from shore. In February a 20-year-old female swimmer was bitten by a shark before dying in hospital from a cardiac arrest.La Reunion local Jeremy Flores, who won the Billabong Pipeline Masters in Hawaii in 2010, paid tribute to Canestri on his Instagram account: “ANOTHER shark attack in Reunion island this morning. 13 years old Elio was one of our best up and coming surfer. Words can’t describe how sad and angry i am. So young !!! Heart breaking News. RIP :(”Authorities immediately put in place a “post-attack procedure” in a bid to capture the shark.Specialised boats were deployed for “targeted fishing in the immediate area around the attack,” the local authorities said in a statement.In February, island authorities extended until February 2016 a law prohibiting swimming and other water-based activities such as surfing and windsurfing except in special areas.This measure has resulted in a dramatic decline in tourism on the island lying to the east of Madagascar.
A man has been jailed for six years for conspiring to rob a post office in which the postmaster was hit with the butt of a gun.Lee Parker, 39, of Leybourne Drive, Bestwood, appeared at Nottingham Crown Court and admitted conspiring to rob the Ambergate Post Office, in Ambergate Road, Beechdale.No money was handed over and the offender fled empty-handed following the incident, on October 13, last year.Detectives from Nottinghamshire Police recovered a distinctive orange and black moped used by the offender to travel from the scene, which was abandoned in Wollaton minutes after the attempted robbery.Their inquiries found that Parker had been involved in the purchase of the moped the night before the robbery.Detective Chief Inspector Karen Pearson said: "This is an excellent outcome at the end of an investigation during which Parker made considerable efforts to try and cover his tracks in order to escape detection."Thanks to the tenacity of the investigation team and the excellent information we had received from members of the public, we were able to link Parker to the robbery through the moped which the offender used to travel to and from the post office."
Nigeria’s First Lady Dame Patience Jonathan is anything but what her first name suggests. She runs her mouth as an inexperienced housewife runs her husband’s hot bath. In fact, her unbridled tongue has become not only a national embarrassment but also an international shame to our country. In the heat of the 2015 electioneering campaigns earlier this month, in Calabar, Cross River state, Patience let her uncouthness assume the level of brazen incitement to violence. Addressing potential pro-Jonathan voters in that city, she said they should not only reject the opposition APC whose campaign platform is ‘change’, but also physically attack opponents of her husband. “if you hear people call for change, stone them”, she exhorted her listeners. “Are you a (bus) conductor?”Patience’s characteristic hate language flies in the face of the non-violence pact her husband and opposition presidential candidates, including APC’s Muhammadu Buhari, signed in January in Abuja in the presence of former UN Secretary General Kofi Anan. While the others have tried to sustain the letter and spirit of that agreement, Jonathan and his PDP hounds, particularly his wife, have not. In fact, the only notable breach of the pact happened on Feb. 17 in Okrika, the home town of the first lady. A bomb went off spectacularly in the vicinity of a secondary school where the APC was holding a rally. As people ran for cover, gunshots rang out. When the dust cleared, a policeman lay dead in the dust. Shockingly, security personnel deployed to the venue to keep the peace could not save even one of their own. And no arrests were made!Shortly afterwards, the first lady uncharitably declared Buhari, her husband’s main opponent in the March 28/29 presidential poll, “brain-dead”. Not being a medical authority in a matter as weighty as that, she would not have made the comment except someone urged her on. As in the case of Ekiti state where governor Fayose earlier had pronounced a death wish on Buhari, neither Jonathan nor the PDP leadership called the first lady to order. And she carries on as though she has not done anything wrong.But hasn’t she? Notable Nigerians joined voices in condemning Patience for inciting Nigerians to physical violence. Nobel Prize in Literature winner, Prof. Wole Soyinka, said the other day that he was ashamed to have Patience as Nigeria’s First Lady and henceforth he would not dignify her with that title. The APC called her “an incredibly crude woman”. Its presidential candidate Buhari has filed a petition against her at the International Criminal Court in The Hague for using hate language. The court has acknowledged receipt of Buhari’s formal complaint and said it would investigate it.There is a precedent. In early March, a court in Cote d’Ivoire convicted and sentenced a former First Lady, Mrs. Simone Gbagbo to 20 years imprisonment for her role in a 2011 post-election violence in which some 3,000 people were killed. Mr. Laurent Gbagbo, himself, is standing trial at The Hague on a crime against humanity charge. We commend Buhari and his party for their mature decision not to fall into the Patience trap. Instead they have chosen legality over sentiment.Patience must be stewing in her putrid juice now. The majority of Nigerians who voted in the recent presidential election did so peacefully and in large numbers too. They have shown that our democracy is growing. Our political culture is maturing. Let’s keep the peace right through the remaining elections and thereafter.

The Australian dollar is lower, coming under pressure from a stronger US dollar and the release of weaker local housing data last week.At 0700 AEST on Monday, the local unit was trading at 76.69 US cents, down from 76.85 cents on Friday.The greenback enjoyed a strong rally last week against most of the major currencies after recent solid economic data increased the chances that the Fed would raise its rate sooner rather than later.BK Asset Management managing director Kathy Lien said increased optimism about the US economy was pushing the Australian dollar lower."Investors bought US dollars aggressively this week with the gains on Friday taking the greenback to its strongest level against the euro in three weeks," she said."Market participants are rushing to position for a June rate hike."Data out on Friday showed that the number of home loans approved in February rose 1.2 per cent, well short of market expectations of a three per cent rise.Ms Lien said that this data also put the Australian dollar under pressure along with some strong Chinese inflation data.
The baby brother of Germany's beloved polar bear Knut, who drew millions of visitors to the Berlin Zoo before his dead in 2011, has been christened.Eight years after Knut drew millions of visitors to the Berlin Zoo, the polar bear's baby brother has been christened at a zoo in the north-eastern German town of Rostock.The cub, now four months old and living with his mother Vilma, was christened "Fiete" on Tuesday after nearly 3,000 name suggestions were submitted at the zoo.Rostock mayor Roland Methling, who has been named the cub's godfather, conducted the christening by spraying the four-month-old cub with water from a fire hose.The polar bear shares a father with Knut, the polar bear that drew millions of people to Berlin in 2007. Knut was the zoo's first polar bear to survive past infancy in three decades and quickly became a global sensation.Knut died in 2011 from the after effects of a brain infection.The christening was one of the new cub's first public appearances since his birth on December 3. Fiete, who now weighs 20 kilogrammes, will remain with his mother for another two years.

Cooper, who was plucked off Major League Soccer waivers, is a veteran of eight MLS seasons. His 75 career regular-season goals rank him 18th all-time. He’s also registered 15 assists, and started 172 of 210 games. He’s appeared in seven MLS playoff matches.“We have spoken about wanting to add quality depth to our attack and we have done so with this signing,” Impact technical director Adam Braz said in a release. “Kenny has scored 75 goals in our league and that says a lot about his abilities. He is an excellent person who will fit in well with our group.”The Impact dropped to 0-2-2 on the season with Saturday night’s 3-0 loss to the Houston Dynamo.Cooper played 22 regular-season games last season, collecting three goals and four assists for the Seattle Sounders. He had two 18-goal MLS seasons, with FC Dallas in 2008 and the New York Red Bulls in 2012.Cooper began his career with Manchester United, then was loaned to Oldham Athletic in League One. He also played in the German second division with 1860 Munich, and the English second division with Plymouth Argyle.Cooper was scheduled to fly to Montreal on Monday and train with the team Tuesday.
A group has claimed  responsibility for hacking the Hobart International Airport website and defacing it with a statement supporting the radical group Islamic State.Tasmania Police say the hacking appears to be "non-discriminate" with identical messages posted on websites worldwide that use the same web hosts as the the airport."Investigations have shown that identical messages have appeared on thousands of websites worldwide since late 2014," a police statement said.The airport's website was shut down at about 5.30am on Sunday when police became aware it was hacked.A message posted on the site said it was "not currently operating. We are working to get it back up and running as soon as possible".Police are investigating and have been monitoring activity at the airport.The website is inaccessible but a Google search shows part of the statement. Fairfax has chosen not to reproduce the words."A message placed on the site contained a statement supporting ISIS," a police statement said."There were no threats made towards the Hobart Airport or flight operations to and from the airport."Britain's new spy chief Alex Younger last month warned the country was in a "technology arms race" with its enemies."The bad news is the same technology in opposition hands, an opposition often unconstrained by consideration of ethics and law, allows them to see what we are doing and to put our people and agents at risk," he said.Hobart Airport has been contacted for comment.
Michel Girard, spokesman for the Montreal fire department, said the dog was wandering off-leash when it jumped into the canal and momentarily disappeared under the ice. The man hesitated, but then jumped into the freezing water after the dog.He managed to get his dog out of the water and onto a piece of ice floating in the middle of the canal. That’s where they were sitting when a team of firefighters from Pointe-Saint-Charles, specifically trained to deal with ice conditions, pulled them into a yellow inflatable raft.The man, suffering from a mild case of hypothermia, was taken by ambulance to a hospital.Both man and dog are expected to survive the ordeal.
My forwards are going backwards: Even carrying a knock, Sturridge is Rodgers' best strikerBrendan Rodgers is resigned to his striking woes being stretched out until the end of the campaign, as he admitted he won’t see the best of Daniel Sturridge until next season.But the Liverpool manager reckons Sturridge must find a way to play through the pain barrier if he is going to deliver on the huge natural talent that made him of the deadliest goal-scorers in the Premier League last year.Sturridge himself has admitted he won’t be back to his highest level until he gets a summer pre-season under his belt, after a season decimated by injury struggles.Add to that Mario Balotelli’s very public meltdown and the failures of Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini, and Rodgers has endured a nightmare season with his strikers.He revealed though, that his job now is to wring as much from 25-year-old Sturridge as he can until May, in the hope that, even at less than 100 per cent, the England forward can still inspire the Reds to FA Cup glory and a late push into the top four.Asked about the forward’s confession he won’t be firing properly until next season, the Reds boss said bluntly: “I knew that when he was first coming back. It’s a long time out.“When you’re out for that length of time, it maybe takes you the same amount of time to get back again. The key for him was to get back and be fit, but he needs a good pre-season - a total run - and hopefully he’ll be fine for next season."Until that point, we have to maximize what we can get out of him.”Red cross: Sturridge has been hampered by thigh, calf and hip injuries this seasonRodgers though, believes Sturridge must evolve his game if he is to deliver the sort of form that singled him out last season as the finest striker of the current England generation.He is a natural in front of goal, but he has also suffered more than his fair share of injuries, and the manager explained that few players are ever 100 per cent fit, and many find it hard to operate effectively when they are carrying a knock.“Everybody is different when they get injured and how they deal with it. A player will never be 100 per cent fit - more or less - when he plays. They’re always carrying something,” he said.“If it hinders performance, then you can only trust the player that he cannot give any more or they can’t operate at the level they want to because of injury.“With Daniel, there’s been a number of injuries that he’s had - and that’s before he came here. He had a fairly sustained run last season and served us well, but this season has been difficult.“He just needs to find a way to physically and mentally try to keep himself as fit as he can, but sometimes that isn’t all down to you – sometimes it’s about luck as well.”Rodgers won’t hold back as he looks to resurrect Liverpool’s Champions League challenge at home to Newcastle on Monday night, and then plot a Cup semi-final win over Aston Villa at Wembley next Sunday.The last time - Newcastle 1-0 Liverpool in pictures:With Balotelli so disastrous, and Borini having played barely 30 minutes since the turn of the year, he has no option but to put Sturridge in the firing line again.And he admitted he won’t go easy on his striker, despite the fitness fears.“I won’t spare anyone if I feel they can contribute and be effective for us. If it fits the work of the team, then I’ll do that. If he’s physically fit to perform, that’s what’s important to me,” he added.“Then it’s a case of how we think he can be best used, whether that’s from the start or coming off the bench – until he’s super-fit. We want to get as much out of him this season as we possibly could.”Rodgers was delivered some grim news over the weekend, with scans showing Mamadou Sakho will be out for a month.That stretches defensive resources even further, as Martin Skrtel serves the last game of his three-match ban on Monday.Emre Can will return against Newcastle though, so Rodgers must decide whether to return to a three-man central defence or slot the German into midfield alongside Jordan Henderson and either Lucas Leiva or Joe Allen.
No matter how many times John Key repeats the Government's line that "no one owns fresh water", it has been clear for some time that National is moving towards granting preferential rights to Iwi.Back in early 2013 Crown lawyers batted away a Supreme Court challenge to the state asset sales programme by explaining that the Maori Council had not raised any demands that were not already on the table.All of the characteristics of ownership (if not "ownership" itself) were under discussion, either through the Treaty settlement process or negotiations with the increasingly powerful Iwi Leaders Group.The exposure on Sunday of a report commissioned by the Iwi Leaders Group calling for "an equitable, permanent share" of water allocations, and a recent Cabinet Paper proposing criteria to give "preferential access" on a case by case basis, are revealing.While the negotiating positions are some way apart, substantial change is coming, which ever way you look at it. National will argue that any future case will be decided on its merits and facts, but establishing a national framework for local circumstance is breaking new ground.Surprisingly, Key has avoided political headaches over the issue so far, but the Prime Minister will know this is a fire waiting to be lit.As a first term MP, Key saw his former leader Don Brash catapulted close to the premiership largely on the back of a speech attacking special rights for Maori at Orewa in 2004.The support National gained in the following weeks has, more or less, stuck with it ever since. There are plenty in the National caucus who were propelled into Parliament by the surge in support which Brash gained in the wake of Orewa.Although National's rhetoric has changed substantially under Key's leadership, and the party is firmly entrenched in power, the issue could be a test of whether the mood of National's supporters have also changed, especially if someone from within tests it.Enter Judith Collins, who from the discomfort of the back benches is free to champion the cause of equality, while risking division within the party and destabilising the caucus, as part of a power play.By attacking the report commissioned by the Iwi Leaders Group, she opens up a possible attack on the Government for giving ground to Maori on fresh water at all.Although some consider Collins' brand to be toxic in the wake of the Dirty Politics saga and suggestions of conflicts of interests, the MP for Papakura could still appeal to more conservative parts of the party.Out in the rural seats where National is arguably strongest (Northland aside) the issue of commercial use of fresh water is brewing into a major political issue, amid a gradual tightening of consent rules.If the Government were to be seen to be adding another layer of cost or uncertainty in favour of Maori, National may face voter revolt.The Northland by-election was surely a lesson that support of the regions is not automatic and the brand of Key is defeatable where there is discontent.National could soon find it has walked into a fight of its own making, and one where it is on the wrong side of much of its support base, its membership and some of its MPs.
Wrapping it up: Scarf-wearing Mourinho watches Chelsea edge closer to the titleJose Mourinho saw his Chelsea team pull off a dramatic late win to stun QPR then insisted: We deserve to win this title.A masked Cesc Fabregas hit his third league goal of the season in the 88th minutes at Loftus Road after a mistake by home keeper Rob Green.Arsenal, have won eight on the bounce to emerge as the Blues' biggest title rivals but the Special One is backing his men - who have been top since beating Burnley 3-1 in the first Monday night match of the season - to finish the job.He said: "What I know is it's not normal for a team to be top of the league since day one; since August - every game, top of the league."That's the team that deserves all the credit."Good runs? Other teams with good runs. We had a good run since day one. Nobody should be disappointed. A good run since August. I think we deserve it."Sunday's win keeps Chelsea - who were without first-choice striker Diego Costa and his back-up Loic Remy because of injuries - seven points clear at the top of the Premier League, with a game in hand on all the chasing teams down to fifth-placed Southampton.How the top of the table standsThe Hoops don't play again until they host West Ham on 25 April because of the FA Cup semi-finals next weekend, but Ramsey would prefer a game sooner to work Fabregas' winner out of his system.He said: "I'd rather have another game. I'd rather go back to 80 minutes."This game is almost like failing your driving test, when you're so close but you fail it. You'd like that time back."We'd rather have another game with the way we're performing at the moment."How the bottom of the table standsRamsey refused to blame keeper Green for the mistake that led to the goal.He said: "You know when a ball goes out wide, and there are eight players behind the ball, you can't blame him at that stage. You have to defend it better."
Rate hikes, proposed new taxes and a culture of wasteful spending has led a group of concerned citizens to form the Auckland Ratepayers’ Alliance which begins operations from today.Auckland Ratepayers’ Alliance spokesperson, Jo Holmes, says, “Our purpose is to hold Auckland Council to account. With 130 spin-doctors the Council is very good at sidelining the concerns of neighbourhood ratepayer groups. By combining forces, this new group will shine the light on those wasting ratepayers’ money."“Aucklanders who are sick and tired of the Council wasting ratepayer money are invited to join us.”Auckland Board Member of the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Union, Gabrielle O’Brien, says, “Traditionally it’s been the business and property groups that have stuck up for fiscal responsibility within Auckland’s local government. Unfortunately most Auckland business groups are now heavily reliant on ratepayer money and find it difficult to bite the Council hand that feeds them.”“With rates digging deeper and deeper into the pockets of Aucklanders, residents need an organisation that gives a collective strength to their voice. The Taxpayers’ Union has assisted in establishing the Ratepayers’ Alliance to ensure that Auckland has a dedicated organisation holding the Mayor, his Council, and officials to account.”Who is behind the Auckland Ratepayers’ Alliance?The Auckland Ratepayers’ Alliance is an initiative of the New Zealand Taxpayers’ Unionand its Auckland members.

MICKLEOVER Sports are on the brink of clinching the Evo-Stik League First Division South title after a 3-0 victory at home to Market Drayton Town.With Leek Town – the only team who can catch them – being held to a 1-1 draw by Spalding United, Sports now need only one point from their remaining two fixtures to be crowned champions.Leek are now 12 points behind but have two games in hand, so Glenn Kirkwood and Craig Hopkins' men will have to keep the champagne on ice for the moment.However, if the Staffordshire side fail to beat play-off hopefuls Gresley on Wednesday, Mickleover will be guaranteed top spot – and promotion to the Premier Division.Sports had beaten Market Drayton 6-1 earlier in the season and soon took charge of Saturday's encounter at the Raygar Stadium.They took the lead after 12 minutes, Andy Dales finding the net with a fizzing shot from just inside the area after good approach play by Anthony Griffiths Junior and Liam Walshe.Jacob Hazel fired wide, Gary Ricketts had an effort ruled out for offside and Dales' 25-yarder was palmed away by keeper Danny Read as the hosts piled on the pressure.Chris Palmer was narrowly off target and Ricketts had a penalty appeal waved away.It was 2-0 after 33 minutes, Hazel scoring a fine solo effort – Sports' 100th league goal of the season.The chances kept coming and the third goal arrived 10 minutes into the second half.Dales' shot was blocked by Read but Ricketts sent a looping header into the net from the follow-up.Follow us on Facebook and Twitter
The house where Tia Sharp was sexually assaulted and then brutally murdered before her body was hidden in the loft has finally been erased from a community.Pictures show the aerial view of the new buildings which have been built following the discovery of the 12-year-old's body in the in 2013.The two-bedroomed terraced house - Number 20 The Lindens in New Addington, near Croydon south London - was bulldozed in June 2013 along with the two neighbouring properties.In its place, two new houses have been built, which will be numbered 19a and 19b, completely wiping number 20 from the map.The two identical houses come with a garden, shed and new solar panels on the roof.The properties are clearly noticeable next to the old houses in the street.One local resident who did not want to be named said: 'We are so relieved that it has gone. It was a constant reminder of the evil that took place there.'It has been raised to the ground and erased from our memories.'The new homes are lovely.'The former home was where evil killer Stuart Hazell, 39, murdered the schoolgirl and dumped her body in the loft.He was living there with his partner, 49-year-old Christine Bicknell, Tia's grandmother.Twisted Hazell was one of the 'heartbroken' family members who 'searched' for Tia during a national manhunt in August 2012 after she disappeared.As the distraught and desperate family members comforted each other in the house, they were unaware that missing Tia was just feet away from them, wrapped in bin-liners in the loft.Father-of-one Hazell suffocated Tia during a sex attack after months of trawling vile internet pornography sites and filming her as she slept.Her body was not found for over a week by police - even though it just feet away from where they had been searching.The property, which is owned by Croydon Council, was demolished to avoid it becoming a sick tourist attraction.Two adjoining houses were also demolished by the council and now building work has been going to replace the three bulldozed properties with two new ones.A Croydon Council spokesman confirmed the homes are near completion and the number 20 will not be used.Hazell, who lied that Tia spent the night at home before heading to a shopping centre in nearby Croydon, was jailed for life in May last year.He pleaded not guilty before changing his plea to guilty on the fifth day of his trial at the Old Bailey.

A modified flu vaccine should give Australians good protection against two new influenza strains that caused a spike in deaths in the northern hemisphere.Australians will have access to a better flu vaccine this year, but will have less time to get their shots before winter sets in.Stocks of the vaccine are arriving about a month later than normal, due to a decision to incorporate two new influenza strains.Experts say it's worth waiting for and should help Australia avoid the spike in flu-related deaths seen during the northern hemisphere winter.High-risk groups - such as the very young and very old, and most indigenous Australians - will be able to access free, government-funded flu shots from April 20.But Dr Alan Hampson, who chairs the Influenza Specialist Group, says everyone should be getting the vaccine, which provides protection against two types of Influenza A - H1N1 and H3N2 - and the Influenza B strain B/Phuket.He said H3N2 and B/Phuket caused a spike in deaths in Europe and the US during the northern winter because the vaccine used there wasn't a good match.World health authorities realised that and modified the vaccine to be used in Australia this winter."Our vaccine now should be a really good match for the strains that are circulating globally and we certainly hope we can prevent more deaths per capita than they did," Dr Hampson told AAP."In fact the vaccine that will be used in the next northern winter will be exactly the same as the one we'll be using over the next few weeks."Dr Hampson said people should be booking their flu shots now, given the delay in stocks arriving."Even if people are not in one of the high-risk groups, they are probably coming into contact with people in their own families who are," he said."Those high-risk groups are harder to protect so it's great if we can also protect the people around them."- Indigenous children aged from six months to less than five years- Anyone aged 6 months and over who suffers from a range of chronic diseases- For the full list go to http://www.health.gov.au/internet/immunise/publishing.nsf/Content/immunise-influenza-qanda#adult

Manchester Giants’ play-off bid is ‘still alive’ after they ended their painful six-game losing streak with a win on the south coast.The Giants bounced bcak from their Friday home loss to Leicester to grab a win that gives them hope of making the BBL play-offs going into the final week of the regualr season.Games at Newcastle on Wednesday, Sheffield on Friday and at home to London Lions on Sunday will decide if they make it to the post-season.Coach Jeff Jones knows it won’t be easy but he is delighted to have a win after a barren spell - even if it was a last second nerve-jangler.The Giants saw their 18-point fourth quarter lead whittled away to just two at one point and after Ingus Bankevics hit one from two from the line with five seconds remaining, the raiders still launched a last-gasp prayer shot to tie it.They couldn’t however and Jones said: “It was a win and we really needed it.“It not going to be simple given the week we have but it’s in our hands and we’ll give it a shot.“It was my fault it was so close. I thought they were done when we had such a big lead but they came back.“We showed character down the stretch and got it.”It puts the Giants in eighth on the same number of points as ninth placed Bristol, who play Leeds in their final game.If Bristol win that game, the Giants would need to take two from their last three - with the south west outfit holding the head to head on them in the event of a tie.Bankevics again led their scoring in Plymouth with 24 while a reinvigorated Stefan Gill had 20 and Ben Eaves had a double-double of 19 points and 11 rebounds.With David Watts (12) and Callum Jones (10, 9 assists) were also in double figures.Giants led 25-22 after a quarter and trailed 51-49 at the half.A big third quarter saw them lead 69-63 going into the fourth a building big lead - before the home team’s, eventually fruitless fightback.

Plymouth Devils suffered a double disappointment over the weekend as they were beaten twice away from home inside 24 hours.Yesterday’s 48-42 defeat to Peterborough Panthers was an improvement on Saturday night’s 66-24 capitulation to Rye House Rockets.Captain Kyle Newman was in fine form for the Devon side at the East of England Showground yesterday in a Premier League Cup group fixture, picking up 13 points from his five rides, comprising three heat wins and two second places.He received solid support from Jack Holder (eight points), Ryan Fisher (seven) and Morton Risager (seven).Plymouth got off to a terrific start with successive heat advantages – Holder winning the first heat with Fisher third for a 4-2 and guest Matt Williamson and Ashley Morris combining for a heat two 5-1 – and it took until heat nine for Peterborough to draw level at 27-27 with a 5-1.Newman split Lasse Bjerre and Michael Palm Toft for a Panthers 4-2 in heat ten before Fisher (first) and Holder (third) took heat 11 4-2.However, Panthers pulled away with successive 5-1 advantages in heats 12 and 13 to lead 43-35.Newman continued his fine afternoon by taking a shared heat 14 but Morris retired at the start and the race went on without him as Peterborough secured victory with the 3-3.A thrilling final race saw Newman race to consecutive heat wins and you could throw a blanket over all four men with Holder in third ensuring a 4-2 advantage for Plymouth.Holder was the lone bright spot for Devils in their 66-24 defeat at Rye House, also in the Premier League Cup, in which the Plymouth side managed to secure just two 3-3 draws.Eight heats finished 5-1 to the Rockets and the other five 4-2 in favour of the Hoddesdon outfit.Holder won heat 11 while Newman and Sam Simota were second and third in heat seven.

The pace of house price growth is prompting more parents or other family members to put their assets on the line by guaranteeing home loans taken out by first home buyers, new figures show.National Australia Bank says the proportion of first home buyers signing up for loans with the bank who have the backing of a family member has lifted to 6.7 per cent from 4.8 per cent in 2010.The practice allows first home buyers with relatively small deposits to secure a loan and is often also used to avoid the cost of mortgage insurance.However, it comes with risks for the family member who agrees to be a guarantor, as it means their assets are, ultimately, on the line for the portion of the loan they have guaranteed.NAB's executive general manager for consumer lending, Angus Gilfillan, said rising house prices and fierce competition from investors had made this option more popular with first home buyer customers."It's getting a lot tougher for first home buyers to enter the market. The rise in house prices has been pretty well-documented, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, where prices have increased by circa 50 per cent since 2008," he said."All of this means that first home buyers need a larger deposit and we're seeing that first home buyers are, effectively, being crowded out of the market."Aside from having a family member guarantee the loan, he said other strategies being used by first home buyers included buying a property as an investor and renting it out for several years, and co-purchasing with family or friends.The Australian Securities and Investments Commission's MoneySmart website urges parents to "think very carefully" before agreeing to guarantee a child's loan.It says that before guaranteeing a loan, they should think about alternatives, such as contributing to a deposit so a guarantee is not needed."Consider how you will pay back the loan if your friend or family member can't. Can you afford the repayments?" the website says.In response to these risks, Mr Gilfillan said NAB's family guarantee product allowed the family member to limit their exposure to a proportion of the loan, not the whole mortgage.If the parents have put down cash to guarantee part of the loan, they also receive interest on this cash.Frequently, he said family members' exposure was under 20 per cent of the loan.This is the point at which banks no longer require costly mortgage insurance, which protects lenders from default risks."The risk associated with providing a guarantee is something that we talk to guarantors about and suggest that they get external advice first," Mr Gilfillan said.He said the bank would also ensure there was "some sort of deposit" form the first home buyer, who would be assessed in line with normal credit procedures.Sydney house prices jumped 13.9 er cent in the year to April and Melbourne prices were up 5.6 per cent, figures from CoreLogic RP Data show.
The Abbott government is struggling to implement key elements of the economic growth plan it promised other G20 countries in Brisbane five months ago.The treasurer, Joe Hockey, is heading to the United States for a meeting of the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington DC later this week.Before leaving Australia for the meeting, Hockey said G20 members “need to follow through on their ambition to lift growth by an additional 2% by 2018”.But obstacles in the Senate, and in some cases resistance from the Coalition backbench, have undermined the government’s attempts to implement the “comprensive growth strategy” that Australia presented to the G20 summit that it hosted in November.Australia’s “new policy commitments” included the six-month waiting period for young people to receive Newstart payments, a gradual increase in the pension age to 70 years, and limiting pension increases to movements in the consumer price index rather than the usually higher benchmark of wage growth – none of which have passed into law.The social services minister, Scott Morrison, is now rethinking the government’s pension changes in the face of Senate hostility and unease within Coalition ranks.The growth plan also included the government’s package to deregulate university fees and extend funding to sub-bachelor programs and private colleges.Tony Abbott specifically mentioned the higher education changes in an address to other G20 leaders in Brisbane when he spoke of the political constraints to economic reform. The prime minister said budget repair had proven to be “massively difficult” for the government.Since the G20 summit, the university measures have been blocked by the Senate twice, although the education minister, Christopher Pyne, said he would try a third time to remove limits on tuition fees.Australia’s growth strategy also included Abbott’s “signature” policy to provide six months of parental leave paid at the full replacement wage. The document said the policy would lift female labour force participation but noted it was “subject to parliamentary approval”.Abbott dropped the policy in February – shortly before he faced an attempted leadership spill – bowing to longstanding backbench concerns that the policy conflicted with the government’s broader message about the need for budget restraint. He said childcare reform was a bigger priority in the push to improve workforce participation.The government has also struggled to secure parliamentary approval for changes to workplace laws including the reinstatement of the Australian Building and Construction Commission set up by the Howard government. But it has launched a Productivity Commission review of industrial relations as promised.Despite setbacks, the government has had success implementing some of the measures outlined Australia’s G20 growth strategy. For instance, the document foreshadowed the entry into force of Australian trade agreements with South Korea and Japan. These deals took effect in December and January, respectively.Hockey said the forthcoming meetings in Washington DC would discuss the major challenges facing the global economy, with growth remaining “modest and uneven” and financial markets “volatile”.“As such, I strongly support the G20’s focus on implementing the G20 growth strategies we agreed to last year in Brisbane,” he said.“At the meetings, I will update G20 members on progress in establishing the global infrastructure hub in Sydney. The hub will provide a platform to lift quality public and private infrastructure investment. All countries, regardless of whether they are members of the G20, will be able to work with the hub and access and contribute to the expertise it gathers.”Hockey said the hub’s permanent board would hold its first meeting in Washington, describing it as “an important step” in its establishment.Each country presented a growth strategy to the G20 summit in Brisbane last year. In their final communique, G20 leaders said they would review progress on their growth plans at their next meeting.Hockey said at the time: “The G20 will focus on the implementation of our collective commitments. We will hold each other to account for our actions.”
The Whigs were the leading progressive political party and main opposition to the Tories during the 18th and 19th centuries. They were responsible for abolishing slavery, emancipating the Catholics and establishing British parliamentary democracy as we know it.Now 32-year-old management consultant Waleed Ghani has resurrected the party, a feat that, to his surprise, appears not to have been attempted in the century and a half since the Whigs fell apart.Mr Ghani, who appointed himself party leader, said he decided to revive the Whigs because he could not vote for any of the candidates standing in the general election.“I didn’t feel it reflected a sense of optimism or confidence for Britain,” he said. “We came out of the Olympics in 2012 and there was an ease with modern Britain, a confidence about who we were and where we were going. Fast forward two years to the next national conversation about who we are: it’s all immigration.”Mr Ghani said he had “always admired” the Whigs. “A lot of people who know about the Whigs like them. They were the good guys for about 200 years.”It took four and a half months for the Electoral Commission to grant him the rights to use the historic political brand. After relaunching the party in October, Mr Ghani attracted interest on social media. He interviewed 10 prospective parliamentary candidates and four will now stand in May, including Mr Ghani and his fiancée Felicity Anscomb.The party’s first manifesto in more than a century is pro-Europe, pro-immigration and defends the rights of renters. It calls for the abolition of university tuition fees, universal childcare from ages two to four and the defence of women’s rights and human rights worldwide.On the stump the first questions are usually about the toupé but “once you’ve got over the barrier of explaining it’s with an ‘h’, it’s not about hair, people are interested”.Paul Bradley-Law, 40, is standing in Stretford and Urmston, Greater Manchester. He also studied the Whigs at school and found the party again on Twitter. “We’re a new thing trying to represent old ideas,” he said. “I’m the first Whig standing at hustings since 1868. If I lose, I will be the first Whig ever to lose in Greater Manchester.”Mr Bradley-Law is upbeat about his chance. “We don’t know how we’re going to do on 7 May, but if I could give people the opportunity to vote for somebody hopeful and optimistic that would make me very happy.”Mr Ghani, who will stand in Vauxhall, is more sanguine. “I’m instinctively relaxed about losing my deposit,” he said. “This is about being engaged with politics and doing something positive.”The Independent has got together with May2015.com to produce a poll of polls that produces the most up-to-date data in as close to real time as is possible.Click the buttons below to explore how the main parties' fortunes have changed:All data, polls and graphics are courtesy of May2015.com.

Manchester United are reportedly set to edge Robin van Persie toward the exit door in the summer transfer window by offering him £5million to leave Old Trafford.Injury and a lack of form have curtailed the Dutchman’s first-team opportunities this season, and with just 14 months remaining on his £250,000-a-week contract his future is becoming increasingly unclear.Louis van Gaal is also thought to be keen to further revamp United’s squad in the close season, and the United boss is reportedly ready to cut his losses on his compatriot to free up funds.According to the Daily Mail, United officials will pay van Persie the remaining half of a £10million loyalty bonus he agreed when joining from Arsenal – so long as his leaves Old Trafford.There are no shortage of suitors for the 30-year-old either, with the likes of Inter Milan, Juventus and Lazio all thought to be interested.MORE: They ARE back!

Munster and Ulster are in second and third place respectively behind Glasgow Warriors after a busy weekend of the Guinness PRO 12 rugby. Connacht -20- Ulster 27Ulster are within a whisker of a coveted home semi-final following a fine win over inter-provincial rivals Connacht at the Sportsground. A brace from Irish winger Tommy Bowe put the Ulstermen in the driving seat, with Louis Ludik, and Craig Gilroy also contributing tries, Ruan Pienaar converted one of which.This was a superbly entertaining game and both teams showed an abundance of attacking ambition. The game seemed done and dusted once Ulster had established a 0-17 lead, but with European qualification on the line, Connacht responded strongly with tries from Matt Healey and Tiernan O’Halloran.Indeed, such was the ferocity of their splendid comeback, the Galway men nearly sneaked it at the death. Although the western province will be extremely disappointed with only their second home loss of the season, they will take heart from a losing bonus point that could yet prove crucial. Ulster, meanwhile, will be thoroughly delighted not only with this superb win, but a bonus point of their own that takes them another step closer to the promised land of the play-offs.Following a protracted dispute over the toss, it was Ulster that started better, controlling possession in Connacht territory early on. Ulster’s strong opening forced Connacht to ship tackles in midfield, and this pressure resulted in Ludik scampering over for the opening try on four minutes. The visitors had secured quick ball in the home 22, and from there Pienaar whipped the ball out to Paddy Jackson, who in turn put fullback Ludik over in the corner. Pienaar missed the conversion, but the Belfast side were happy enough with a 0-5 advantage.It was all Ulster therefore, as the Galway men struggled to achieve dominance at the breakdown. The hosts then conceded a kickable penalty on 11 minutes when lock Aly Muldowney illegally tackled Ulster openside Chris Henry.Unfortunately, for the northern province, however, Pienaar’s kick drifted wide of the posts. The hosts began to accrue some possession thereafter, with big ball carriers like John Muldoon and George Naoupu leading the charge. And the men in green thought they had sneaked a try on 20 minutes when Bundee Akii seemed to have got a hand on the ball when Pienaar was trying to clear Ulster lines at a ruck. Sadly for the men in green, though, the TMO decreed that it was the Ulster scrum half who applied downward pressure first.Although the contest was very attrition based for much of the first half, there was no shortage of ambition from both teams, and they certainly played with admirable width. The gaps failed to emerge for a long time, though, as the defences remained ascendant. Ulster were shading the contest, though, and it was the visitors that made the breakthrough on 32 minutes.The northerners secured quick ball in the home 22, and their speed of passing put the Connacht defence under severe pressure. Jackson spun the ball out to Bowe on the wing, and the Irish winger had no difficulty touching down with only big Quinn Roux was covering.Piennar missed the conversion, but the momentum was now undeniably with Ulster. And their advantage was copper fastened further on 35 minutes when fellow winger Gilroy took the ball at pace and powered over in the left hand corner. Pienaar converted this time to earn his side a 0-17 lead.By half time, the northern side was in a commanding position, but alas many of Connacht’s problems were self-inflicted as their defensive line was breached too easily.Perfect start for Connacht in Second HalfConnacht had a lot of work to do at the beginning of the second period then, but they made the perfect start, scoring in the first five minutesThe hosts strung a few phases together in the opposition half, and Ulster’s defence held them initially. But winger Healey spotted a gap and powered over on 45 minutes by evading a lacklustre challenge from Chris Henry. Miah Nikora converted to reduce the gap to 7-17. And the momentum continued for the Galway side on 51 minutes as Nikora curled over a difficult penalty to bring Connacht within seven points.But Ulster responded well, and re-established field position in the home 22. Thus on 57 minutes more quick Ulster ball saw the Connacht defence stretched, allowing Bowe to get over for his second try and bag the bonus point. Pienaar missed the extras, but Ulster now had some precious breathing space. Connacht were now struggling, but they showed a laudable tenacity to get back into the game.On 60 minutes replacement Carty clawed back some of the lead with a well-taken penalty.Ulster’s win was sealed on 64 minutes, though, as skipper Best scored at the bottom of a trademark rolling maul.Piennar missed the conversion, but it was now a long way back for the hosts. To their credit, Connacht came strongly again as they built pressure in the Ulster half. And on 72 minutes they gave themselves a lifeline as fullback O’Halloran finished well in the corner to score another try.Carty converted from the tightest of angles to bring it back to 20-27. The last five minutes provided wonderful entertainment as Connacht chased a victory that had once seemed so elusive. The men in green were quite brilliant as they threw the ball around with abandon.In one breathtaking passage, the hosts went the full length of the pitch will ball in hand and very early got the try they so richly deserved, but Daniel Poolman failed to hold Robbie Henshaw’s offload with the line at his mercy. Ulster held on then to celebrate a fantastic derby win that could mean so much in the context of their season.Leinster are now fifth in the Pro 12 table. James Benjamin scored two late tries as Newport Gwent Dragons’ surprise 25-22 victory over Leinster gave them their first-ever GUINNESS PRO12 season double over the Irish province.
The queen said immigrants need to know what they're getting into when they come to Denmark. Photo: Henrik Rasmussen/ScanpixAhead of her 75th birthday on April 16, Queen Margrethe II made a rare forray into political matters in a Sunday interview with Berlingske newspaper.Speaking about the state of affairs in Denmark in the aftermath of the February attacks in Copenhagen, Queen Margrethe said that Danes have kept their heads cool in the face of terror.The queen added that she is shocked by the increase in threats and harassment aimed at Denmark’s Jewish community.“That Jews today are suddenly looked askance at, feel under pressure and under threat is shocking – because they are threatened. They carry it with great dignity, as they always have, but it a shocking thing to witness,” she said.Queen Margrethe also waded in to the hyper-charged discussion of immigration.Whereas the queen has previously urged her people to be welcoming and accepting of immigrants and refugees, she said in her new interview that it is important to “set requirements”.“It is obvious that when a society accepts a lot of people from the outside, one must also set the requirement that they understand where they have come. We will make space [for them], but they have come to our society and they can therefore not expect that their old societal models can just be carried on in our country,” Queen Margrethe said.“They can go to the mosque when they want – anything else would be unreasonable – but when they begin to do things that aren’t consistent with the overarching patterns of Danish society, they must realize that that will not do,” she added.The queen said that newcomers need to accept Denmark the way it is, terrible weather and all.“That November begins at the end of October and lasts until the end of March isn’t fun to experience when you come from a dry and warm climate. One can become sad from all of that greyness. But that is a premise of living here,” she said.Like the weather, immigrants and refugees also need to accept Danish attitudes for what they are, the queen said.“The mental climate that dominates Denmark from olden days is also a side of the climate, just like the wind and weather,” Queen Margrethe added.“Yes, we should be accepting but we should also say what we expect. Because it is our society that they are coming to. We are an old society that is happy to take in the people who need it but we also need them to understand where they have come. I think that is very vital,” she told Berlingske.
Local residents and environmentalists have moved to a war footing with the weekend launch of a campaign to fight plans for a $1.6 billion road freight link between Kewdale and Fremantle.And they are prepared to do whatever it takes - "procedurally, legally and physically" - to stop the project, which will include Perth's first toll road.The offensive, organised by the community group Fremantle Road2Rail, was launched at a forum in Fremantle on Saturday.Organiser and City of Fremantle councillor Sam Wainwright said good public policy had been swept aside in favour of blind ideological obsession because the road link plans ignored real science and economic analysis.He said rail was a far more efficient way to move containers to and from the port. It was also safer, healthier and better for the environment."When all the costs of the Perth Freight Link are examined - including increased congestion, greenhouse gas emissions, dangerous diesel particulate pollution and the destruction of remnant bushland - the project will simply not stack up when compared to an investment in better public transport and rail freight solutions," Mr Wainwright said.The project, which is jointly funded by the State ($650 million) and Federal ($925 million) governments, is due to begin in mid-2017 and be completed by mid-2019. It includes the controversial Roe 8 project that extends Roe Highway to Stock Road, through the Beeliar wetlands.The State Government believes the project will remove 500 trucks a day from Leach Highway and provide a more efficient freight link to the Fremantle port.Greens senator Scott Ludlam told the forum that plans for the "wretched" freight link were driven by stupidity and 1950s ideology.He said public opponents needed a coherent alternative and to be prepared to do whatever was needed - "even standing in front of earthmoving equipment if we have to" - to fight the plan.

The Australian dollar is lower against a surging US dollar as more traders bet on a June interest rate rise by the Federal Reserve.At 0630 AEST on Monday, the local unit was trading at 76.68 US cents, down from 76.85 cents on Friday.The greenback enjoyed a strong rally last week after solid economic data increased the chances that the Fed would raise its rate sooner rather than later.
It is often considered an industry for the glamorous, the beautiful and the young, but it was the steady march of the grandes dames of British theatre that dominated this year’s Olivier Awards.Dame Angela Lansbury won her first Olivier at the age of 89, in honour of her return to the London stage after a four-decade absence.Penelope Wilton, star of Downton Abbey, made it sixth time lucky as she picked up a best actress award after six nominations dating back to 1981.Dame Angela, who has numerous Golden Globes and an honorary Oscar to her name thanks to a career on television and Broadway, took home her Olivier for best actress in a supporting role, as Madame Arcati in Blithe Spirit.“I’m so infinitely grateful to have this baby in my hands,” she said, on picking up her statuette.“Here I am, creeping up to 90, feeling like a million dollars,” she continued. “I can’t remember a lot of things at this age, except I can remember my lines.”Wilton was named best actress for her portrayal as the mother of little-known German lawyer Hans Litten who stood up to Hitler in Taken at Midnight.“It was a story that needed to be told,” Wilton said. “It has a resonance today even though it’s about a man who died in 1937; it’s about the importance of democracy and freedom of speech.”The night, considered a success for homegrown talent, was something of a disaster for the National Theatre, which went home empty-handed in its worst performance since the awards began in 1976.Instead, the Young Vic and Hampstead Theatre triumphed with four awards each, for their acclaimed productions of A View from the Bridge and Sunny Afternoon.Ray Davies, of the Kinks, received an award for outstanding achievement in music for the show he co-wrote that includes some of the band’s hits.Sylvie Guillem was also presented with a special award in honour of her 39-year career following announcement of her retirement. Dame Judi Dench presented Kevin Spacey with an award “in recognition of his tenure as artistic director at The Old Vic Theatre”.Kevin Spacey playing Clarence Darrow at the Old VicThe award for best actor was taken by Mark Strong, for his role in A View from the Bridge, which also saw Ivo Van Hove awarded best director.Mark Strong (centre) stars in A View from the Bridge (Photo: Alastair Muir)Nicole Scherzinger, star of the revival of Cats, missed out on an award but performed her version of Memory.Instead, the musical categories were dominated by Sunny Afternoon, named best musical, and Beautiful – The Carole King Musical, which garnered Oliviers for Katie Brayben and Lorna Want.Mike Bartlett took home the award for best new play, for Charles III at the Almeida Theatre, while Nathaniel Parker won best supporting actor as Henry VIII in Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies.Speaking after he picked up his award for outstanding achievement in music, Ray Davies said the "very special" award was recognition for a task "outside what I normally do".His writing experience on Sunny Afternoon, he disclosed, has inspired him to create a new musical before the end of the year."It will be original, for my sins," he said. "It's going to be iconic, spectacular."Kevin Spacey, who closed the awards ceremony with a surprise musical rendition of Bridge Over Troubled Water, called his ten years at the Old Vic the "most extraordinary experience he ever could have hoped for", adding: "I love that theatre more than I can express here."Introducing his award, Dame Judi Dench told the London theatre scene: "We have really, really got to thank him for what he's done for us, good luck to the person taking over, and I hope he doesn't stay away too long."Both Spacey and Dame Angela received standing ovations from the Royal Albert Hall audience.
Tourists at a popular Wild Atlantic Way destination were greeted with human faeces litter in the area as the public toilets were closed on the hottest weekend of the year so far.A local councillor in Doolin, Co Clare said the lack of public toilets at Doolin pier resulted in people relieving themselves between parked cars during the recent Bank Holiday weekend.The public toilets at the pier are only open during the summer months from May to September.Councillor Bill Slattery told the Clare Champion the litter could ruin the 'excellent reputation' the tourism spot has built up."I am told that there were children walking on human faeces," Cllr Slattery said."These are children from different countries. This could ruin the excellent reputation that Doolin has built up."I am told that the Clare County Council does not have the manpower to open the toilets and that is not good enough."I want to see them opened immediately to prevent this type of thing happening and if it has happened, I want to see the area cleaned up," he told the newspaper."We are spending millions promoting and marketing the Wild Atlantic Way but when people arrive to a discovery point like Doolin, there are not even basic facilities like toilets."That is not good enough. I am annoyed and the people who have complained to me are even more annoyed."Doolin pier is a popular spot for tourists with ferries in the area providing daily trips to both the Aran Islands and around the Cliffs of Moher.The local authority is now working to resolve the issue, according to a senior council engineer.
Has the feted gas "supply cliff" turned into a gas supply mountain? We were told by the gas lobby there would be severe gas shortages on the east coast. We were told the moratorium on coal seam gas mining in Victoria had to be lifted, CSG projects at Gloucester and Narrabri had to be ramped up with the utmost urgency.Amid the fear campaign, regulators whacked through 17 per cent retail price rises in NSW. In Victoria, where gas heating is a bigger deal, and prices have risen 6 per cent so far, we were treated to this sort of press: "Victorians' gas bills will skyrocket by hundreds of dollars over the next few years and low-income earners will be the worst affected, according to a report from a consumer utilities body".Last Thursday however, with little fanfare, AGL told the Australian Securities Exchange it had entered into a gas supply agreement with Esso and BHP to purchase up to 198 petajoules (PJ) of natural gas from Bass Strait over three years.This deal, said the release, would enable AGL to "secure competitively priced gas supply until 2020 for our 1.5 million residential and small business gas customers".There is even enough for them to pipe up to 50PJ to Queensland to be turned into LNG and shipped off to Asia."This whole shortage thing was a total beat-up," says analyst Bruce Robertson. "It didn't exist. At any time they could have gone and done this deal with BHP and Esso. The gas has always been there.AGL has done rather nicely out of all this. In June 2011, it had resold one of its supply contracts to QCLNG. The contract was for three years; 54PJ – 74PJ "at an attractive oil-linked price".As Robertson said in his submission to the NSW gas inquiry earlier this year, "I do not in any shape or form condemn a corporation for making a profit. It is however hypocritical to claim a domestic shortage when you are busy selling contracts that you possess that would solve that very same shortage."The east coast has always been supplied by Bass Strait and the Cooper Basin, despite bizarre warnings that gas might have to be "imported" if unpopular CSG projects were not advanced. "Imports" are traditionally things that pertain to trade between nations, not things sent down a pipeline between states.It is high time competition regulators turned their gaze on the gas cartel. Robertson, in a submission to the NSW gas inquiry, argues the gas cartel is colluding and fixing the prices far too highly.Further, there is zero visibility on gas reserves as the producers don't tell anybody how much gas they have. Neither do the suppliers disclose their LNG contracts. Yet in the face of trenchant opposition from rural communities who rightly argue the science is still out on fracking and the risks to productive farmland are too great, producers persist with their marginal, high-cost CSG projects.As for price, the evidence of collusion is that producers can enter into "joint marketing arrangements" while proffering no proof as to the alleged shortage.In India, the domestic price is regulated and is currently set at $US4.66/mmbtu (equivalent to a gigajoule) based on a world price for gas. Recent price movements on the subcontinent have been down, not up as they have been in Australia.The Australian Energy Market Operator conducts a spot market. Presently, spot prices are depressed as gas production ramps up ahead of LNG exports.The price for gas delivered into the Sydney market is $3.49/GJ, while they are virtually giving gas away in Brisbane at $0.52/GJ. The Henry Hub (a proxy for gas in the US) price is $US2.63/mmbtu. Gas has traded below $US3.32 all this year.In Australia, the gas cartel is withholding supply to our manufactures and asking them to pay $7.50-$10/GJ to secure long-term contracts. Tired of suffering at the mercy of the gas cartel, and of its opaque and anecdotal market data, Manufacturing Australia has called for reforms for the east coast gas market.This is a good thing, but it doesn't go nearly far enough. Reforms should indeed be struck to free up markets, as Manufacturing Australia suggests. This is not a market however, it is a cartel. Free markets exhibit visibility of supply and demand. This is the terrain of competition policy.
Roubaix: John Degenkolb on Sunday became the first German to win the Paris-Roubaix since 1896 and only the third man to win the 'Hell of the North' and Milan-San Remo in the same season.The 253km ride across the infamous cobbles of northern France ended with Degenkolb of the Giant Alpecin team crossing the line at the Roubaix velodrome in a sprint finish ahead of Czech rider Zdenek Stybar (Etixx-Quick Step) and Belgian Greg Van Avermaet (BMC).Degenkolb made his move within the last 10km, joining Van Avermaet and his compatriot Yves Lampaert, who had powered away earlier six kilometres from the finish line.The trio was rejoined by several others, including Stybar, in the finale but the German easily outsprinted his rivals on a sunny afternoon."The race I've always dreamed of to win," Degenkolb said, who joined Irishman Sean Kelly in 1986 and Belgian Cyrille van Hauwaert back in 1908 as the only riders to claim Roubaix and Milan-San Remo in the one year."This is unbelievable. I can't get it right now. My team was there all day to hold the situation under control until I could start. I was not afraid to fail and that was the key."A nine-man breakaway built an eight-minute advantage and the brutal race quickly started to take its toll with several minor crashes ending with riders in fields and ditches.The race was almost marred by tragedy when several riders squeezed around the barriers at a level crossing in an attempt to make it across before an approaching high-speed train. They made it with seconds to spare in a move – 85km from the end – that would have ordinarily triggered a disqualification.Instead, race commissaires slowed the pack down to allow those waiting for the train to rejoin the front.Belgian Stijn Devolder, who had an outside chance of victory, crashed out in one of the first cobbled sectors and was taken to a hospital with face and leg wounds, according to his Trek Factory team.Shortly afterwards Team Sky's Geraint Thomas, one of the pre-race favourites, crashed after hitting a curb; he had already punctured twice and did not make it back to the peloton.Former Tour de France winner Bradley Wiggins briefly threatened with an attack in the closing stages but he was unable to bridge the gap to the breakaway.In his last road race before leaving Team Sky and returning to the track ahead of next year's Rio Olympics and an Hour Record attempt, the reigning Olympic and world time trial champion finished 18th, in a group 31sec behind. His teammate Luke Rowe finished 8th for Sky.The classics season will move to the Ardennes region next Sunday with the Amstel Gold Race, a series of one-day races on hilly terrain.
Kurdish militia made headway on Sunday into Syria's northern Raqa province, where the extremist Islamic State group has set up its de facto capital, Kurdish officials and a monitor said.The Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) "took over a large cement factory and three villages" northwest of the town of Ain Issa, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.Observatory head Rami Abdel Rahman said the YPG had fought "fierce clashes" against IS jihadists in the past 48 hours and were now in control of a total of villages in the area.At least six IS fighters had been killed in Sunday's clashes, bringing to 20 the death toll for the extremist group during the past two days, Abdel Rahman told AFP.There was no immediate information on Kurdish casualties.Ain Issa is less than 60 kilometres (35 miles) from the capital of IS's self-styled "caliphate" in Raqa city.It also lies just 45 kilometres south of Tal Abyad, a border town used by IS as a gateway for fighters coming in from Turkey.A spokesman for the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD) said YPG forces had taken over "a very large cement factory" in Raqa province."The YPG have been trying to take this area for a long time," Newaf Khalil told AFP by phone.Since driving IS out of the flashpoint town of Kobane in January, Kurdish and allied forces have taken much of the surrounding countryside in the northern province of Aleppo and begun pushing east into neighbouring Raqa province.In February, Kurds and rebel groups with air support from the US-led coalition against IS seized control of 19 villages in Raqa province.YPG forces have also been pressuring IS in northeastern Syria, where they launched a counter-offensive against an IS assault.On Saturday, they pushed IS back from Tal Tamr, a strategic town on a road running east across the Iraqi border to IS's bastion in Mosul, as well as north to the Turkish border.
HILARY Clinton has finally announced that she will make another run for the White House - with a video offering some answers as to why she wants the top job and what she could do for ordinary voters if she is elected as America's first woman president.Mrs Clinton made the announcement via social media and is expecting to then head to the battleground state of Iowa, which holds the country's first primary elections."Every day Americans need a champion and I am going to be that champion," Mrs Clinton said in a video lasting two minutes and eighteen seconds and portraying various people and families, including two gay couples."She was a formidable candidate in 2008, she was a great supporter of mine in the general election, she was an outstanding secretary of state, she is my friend," President Barack Obama said on Saturday in Panama City, when asked about the woman he beat in an exhausting battle to earn the Democratic nomination.He added: "I think she would be an excellent president."Reports had said that at the centre of Mrs Clinton's campaign pitch would be her claim that she can tackle growing economic inequality in the country. She will also stress he attempt to become the first woman to sit in the Oval Office.When she pulled out in 2008, she voiced her regret that she had been unable to crack "that highest and hardest glass ceiling this time".In the video she said she was running because a lot of Americans were still struggling. And she also sought to address those who had suggested many voters believe Mrs Clinton is out of touch."I'm hitting the road to earn your vote," she said in the video.Reuters said that in a memo made public on Saturday, Mrs Clinton's campaign manager Robby Mook told staff that while the goal was for the the candidate to win the presidency, the campaign was not about her but everyday Americans."We are humble. We take nothing for granted, we are never afraid to lose, we always out-compete and fight for every vote we can win. We know this campaign will be won on the ground, in states," he said.Mrs Clinton was narrowly beaten by Mr Obama when she competed for the Democratic nomination in 2008. Since then, and after having served four years as Secretary Of State, it has been widely assumed Mrs Clinton would run in 2016, and would do so with front-runner status.After decades, in the public eye she can still struggle to connect with ordinary voters and can sometimes appear brittle and aggressive. She is a massive target for Republican opponents who know that many on the right hate the Clintons.Mrs Clinton, who is now a grand-mother will also have to persuade voters, that she will have the vigour and energy to deliver on her promises. If elected, she will be 69 when she takes office in 2017, and only one incoming US president - Ronald Reagan - has been older.Opinion polls show Mrs Clinton has a huge lead over potential 2016 Democratic rivals, and few are expected to enter the race. A Reuters-Ipos tracking poll shows Mrs Clinton earning the backing of more than 60 per cent of Democrats. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a favourite of liberals but who says she is not running, is a distant second at 18 per cent.Other than that, former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley and former Senator Jim Webb of Virginia, whose support languishes in single digits in polls, are the most prominent contenders to take steps toward challenging her.Republicans have been gearing up for the battle, and a big field of Republican presidential contenders is expected. Senators Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky have been the first to formally enter the race, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will add his name to the list on Monday.
Colleen Hayward's whole life has been about education."That really is the foundation for us all," the head of ECU's Kurongkurl Katitjin Centre for Indigenous Education and Research and pro-vice-chancellor Equity and Indigenous said."The more we can learn about each other in respectful ways, the happier, healthier and safer communities we build," she said.For more than three decades, Professor Hayward, a senior Noongar woman and daughter of WA's first Aboriginal teacher and school principal Len Hayward, has been an inspiration not just to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders but also to all Australians through her work across a range of fields such as education, human rights and children's health.Her numerous awards and other forms of recognition include the WA Premier's Multicultural Ambassador's Award (2006), the National NAIDOC Aboriginal Person of the Year Award (2008) and the Order of Australia (2012).She is an inductee into the WA Department of Education's Hall of Fame for achievement in Aboriginal education and the WA Women's Hall of Fame.But it all comes back to education."All I ever really wanted to do was be a teacher," Professor Hayward said. "Mum and Dad were both teachers and that's how we ended up in Kalgoorlie - in those days you still had to do country service to get your permanency."The second of six children attended Brentwood Primary School, Applecross Senior High School and Mt Lawley teachers' college before teaching in primary schools for the next 11 years."I loved it," she said. "In primary teaching, you get to have a class of kids for a whole year. Over the course of that time you see their development, not only academically but as people."Despite her love for her chosen profession, Professor Hayward's journey was to take a different direction when, at the age of just 30, she was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer that left her unable to teach or have children of her own."It was a very close call," she said. "It made me reflect that if I had survived, it must have been for a reason. I like the adage of 'doing what you love and loving what you do', because life is quite literally too short to do something less than that."That's why I really want to do things that are important."One of those ways to make a difference is to be a role model for Aboriginal students."For me, it is about how you live your life," she said."We have nearly 300 Aboriginal students at ECU this year. It's the highest number we've had for a while."And because I hold a senior position within the university, I hope that every one of those 300 students looks at me and says, 'I can do that'. Not just in education, but in business, in government or in another enterprise."Sometimes I just think we underestimate the inspiration we can be for others."
April 13 (BusinessDesk) - The New Zealand dollar rose to a fresh record against the euro and commentators say it is likely to continue to break new ground as a stronger local economy contrasts with weakness in Europe.The kiwi touched 71.20 euro cents over the weekend, and was trading at 70.95 cents at 8am in Wellington, from 70.89 cents at 5pm on Friday. The local currency slipped to 75.22 US cents from 75.34 cents at the New York close and 75.71 cents in Wellington on Friday.The New Zealand dollar has gained 10 percent against the euro so far this year as a comparatively weaker European economy and the region's loose monetary policy contrasts with New Zealand's relatively stronger outlook. Currency analysts in the latest BusinessDesk quarterly survey picked the euro as the currency expected to be the weakest against the kiwi this year."The euro is a dog," said Peter Cavanaugh, an advisor at Bancorp Treasury Services. "They have got bugger all growth, bugger all inflation, massively high unemployment, stupendously high youth unemployment and a central bank who has finally spat the dummy and turned on the printing presses with considerable gusto."Barring a massive New Zealand-based disaster that sends the New Zealand dollar massively down, it's difficult to see the kiwi going down."Today, traders will be eyeing the release of Chinese March trade data to see how New Zealand's largest trading partner is tracking.In New Zealand, electronic card transaction data for March is published at 10.45am.The New Zealand dollar slipped to 98.06 Australian cents from 98.32 cents on Friday, ahead of the release of Australian credit card spending data today.The local currency was trading at 90.40 yen from 91.23 yen on Friday ahead of the publication of the Bank of Japan minutes to its March meeting. The kiwi was little changed at 51.40 British pence from 51.44 pence on Friday. The trade-weighted index declined to 79.11 from 79.39 on Friday.
The Taupo Based Greenlea Rescue helicopter was dispatched to the pureora forest this afternoon, by the RCCNZ after a PLB was activated.A man who was hunting with his son, used his own beacon to raise the alarm for a group of cyclists, one of whom has had a fall.The group were quickly located with the help of a GPS coordinate acquired from the active PLB, near the end of the timber trail.Due to the terrain a LandSAR member and a medic were hover loaded from the helicopter in the only possible location near the injured woman.The woman in her fifties was treated and stretcher loaded into the hovering helicopter before being flown to Rotorua Hospital with pelvis and hip injuries.
Swimming had previously been prohibited on Saint-Leu de La Réunion beachA 13-year-old boy was killed by a shark while surfing off the French island of Reunion in the Indian Ocean.He was surfing in an off-limits area when the shark attacked him and bit off his arms, legs and a section of his stomach.Rescuers arrived at the scene quickly, but the severity of the injuries meant he could not be saved.This was the island's seventh shark-related death since 2011 - although there have been 16 attacks in area in this timeframe.A surfer rides a wave off Reunion The tourist Island of Reunion has seen a rise in numbers of shark attacks in recent years.Following a non-fatal shark attack in February, Island authorities had banned all water activities outside selected areas.
KITCHENER — Mike Jakobowski has a fairy-tale ending in mind for his first Ever After Music Festival.Two stages, 36,000 university-aged ravers. And one special 53-year-old guest of honour."I cannot wait to bring my dad on stage to show him what DJing has become," said Jakobowski — the 27-year-old founder, partner and resident DJ for the two-day rave party of electronic dance music coming to Bingemans May 30-31."And to allow him to be proud of me."His dad, Peter, was a DJ back in Poland. When Mike's sister Natalie was little, she would spin around the dance floor in the tiny clubs of Bydgoszcz until it got too late for her to be out.The music's infectious beat flowed from Peter through Natalie and eventually percolated in the proudPolish blood of young "Mehow.""That's kind of where I got the music in my blood," Jakobowski said.Six weeks later, his vision for a university rave celebration, with a backdrop of acrobats, is set to descend on the campground setting of Bingemans.Local DJs will play on one stage. Two dozen big-name international DJs will perform on another. So far, he's expecting 20,000 daily visitors from North America and Europe based on ticket sales through www.everafterfest.com. But he'd like to reach 36,000.Other than Jakobowski's dad, a Waterloo labourer, this event won't be aimed at the older generation."We thought we'd hit the whole university market," Jakobowski said. "There's University of Waterloo. There's Laurier. There's Conestoga. We've got a lot of promotions. And we're trying to be centralized between Toronto and London."After 18 months of meetings and hard planning, they've got their permits and the city's blessing to put some Polish electronic polish on an old German town's image as a polka capital."My dad always said that you always have to strive and work hard to achieve your goals," he said.Jakobowski would like Ever Afters to run once a year, ever after. He's even got his eye on bringing a Frosh Week rave up to Bingemans next fall. Is that too much, too quickly?"Let's make sure you get one great event under you belt first," said Mark Bingeman, the facility president. "Then we can certainly talk about future items."First, Jakobowski has to get his dad up on stage. That's his happy ever-after moment.
LINDSAY LOHAN: Imagine turning up to a friend's party and discovering this as you opened the door - worst nightmare material. "What have they done to poor Rodge's nipples? Frozen the tic tacs off?!" We'd bounce. Immediately.DEBRA MESSING: She's obviously snapchatting Lindsay Lohan mid-party. "Sorry cldnt be thr babe. I'd luv 2 wrap in plastic and just hang, but lines 2 learn, you know how tiz. how r rodge's nipz? lolz."SARAH MICHELLE GELLAR: We heard python was in for next season, but we hope to God this isn't what all the fashion magazines meant. We are nowhere near as brave as Buffy.CHRISSY TEIGEN: It's not often you would say this of the spouse of a famous swimsuit model . . . but her poor, poor husband.REESE WITHERSPOON: And here begin the daily reminders that most of Hollywood are heading into spring as we're getting washed away into the Wellington gutters. (Yes we do flaunt our Christmas Day barbecues in the northern hemisphere's face but we also live in a heatpump-less house and so are allowed to be selfishly bitter).BLAKE LIVELY: Reason No 327 we love the ex-Gossip Girler. She captioned this photo: "Should I be concerned that my husband's never looked at me this way?" No fear necessary Blake, we're pretty sure this is the way everyone looks at Dame Helen - us included.JANUARY JONES: A brioche in the bath? Now that is one lady truly living the dream. We hope she's got a steady hand because as one of us can testify after dropping half an apple turnover in the bath once (no naming names), pastry crumbs immersed in water can get in places you didn't even think possible.ROSIE HUNTINGTON-WHITELEY: We like to consider ourselves normal levels of confident, but our egos simply couldn't take working out in a mirrored-up gym like this with Rosie H-W next to us. We'd burpee our average-girthed glutes straight out of there. And then probably eat our feelings.RITA ORA: Just one glance at the singer's new boots, and the backs of our knees are already sweating in sympathy. Just imagine the bottles and bottles of Johnson's Baby Powder she must get through just to get these babies on and off each day. We're getting flashbacks of Ross from Friends' talc-and-sweat paste thighs. Not aspirational.KIM KARDASHIAN: The Kardashians approach the holy weekend of Easter as they approach life - subtly, without much fanfare nor overt commercialism (oh, and with pictures of themselves looking on at all times for good measure).NAOMI CAMPBELL: But on that note, the Kardashians have plenty to learn from one of the original Supers. Because nothing says age-old religious holiday quite like straddling a terrifyingly huge chocolate bunny in a bikini that can't quite contain your own goodies.
Closed myki gates have created long queues as football fans attempted to enter Richmond Station after Essendon beat Hawthorn at the MCG on Sunday evening.The myki gates at the station - usually opened to let through large crowds - remained closed after the game, as they will all year.The queue stretched back along Brunton Avenue past the Richmond Football Club's training ground, expanding its entire width.Commuters took to social media to vent their frustration.Ben Pratt tweeted Metro Trains saying "this is really not working #openthebarriers".Xavier Blair tweeted it was an "absolute joke" trying to exit the station on the way to the game.Public Transport Victoria decided late last year to close the gates at Richmond station after "new-generation" myki readers and additional gates were installed at the Brunton Avenue and Olympic Boulevard entrances.The organisation said the move was made to regulate the flow of people through the gates and curb fare evasion, which costs more than $50 million a year."The Richmond Station improvements also increased the number of myki readers at each exit and widened the station entrance," a PTV spokeswoman said last week."The closed gates also reduce overcrowding on platforms as they facilitate a steady stream of customers entering the station, rather than huge crowds all at once."The spokeswoman said Metro staff would open the gates "in circumstances where crowding presents any safety risk to customers".Public Transport Victoria earlier tweeted advising commuters leaving the MCG to have their myki cards ready and to consider using the station's Olympic Boulevard entrance.A Metro Trains spokeswoman said there were no safety issues at the station and numbers were as expected."It's always busy after a game," she said.
Since appearing as the movies' title character, Daniel has managed to shake off Harry and ensure he's known by his own name - which has been aided by the fact he'll happily get his kit off on-screen and on-stage. After stints in the West End and on Broadway, Daniel recently starred in 'What If', and in 2015, fans will see him take on the role of Igor in 'Frankenstein'.Since hanging up his wizard's hat, Rupert has made waves on the West End stage, and in 2013 he received rave reviews for his performance in 'Mojo'. He also stowed some his 'Harry Potter' cash away and splashed it on an ice cream truck, fulfilling a childhood dream. Aww!After being everyone's favourite bad guy in the films, Tom decided to try something a little different and recorded a number of singles, which he shared with fans via YouTube. He's currently filming 'Clavius', where he stars as a character called Lucius. Tom's also really, really good at Twitter.After getting surprisingly dishy, Matthew now spends his time reminding everyone that he's also hugely talented, making his West End debut in 2012 alongside Arthur Darvill and Laurence Fox in 'Our Boys'. Matthew also took part in one of the best editions of Innuendo Bingo ever on Scott Mills' Radio 1 show.Bonnie was one of the 'Harry Potter' frachise's younger stars, however, that hasn't stopped her from going on to carve a successful career. While she hasn't quite achieved the worldwide success of the films' leading stars, Bonnie has been applauded for her work as a model and actress. She also writes and directs her own screen plays.To be honest, Rob's had a rather quiet life since his character's exit left us weeping in the 'Goblet Of Fire' film. After a lot of digging, Robert's main achievement seems to be another franchise entitled 'Twilight'. Nope, we've never heard of it either...Julie is one of the many huge names who appeared in the 'Harry Potter' films so it's not like her career needed the boost. Since the final film in 2011, Julie's been praised by critics her roles in a whole host of other movies, including voicing the witch in Disney's 'Brave'.Already a legend, Dame Maggie Smith continues to win fans with her performance as the Dowager Countess in hit TV series 'Downton Abbey'. She's also no stranger to the big screen, and starred in 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' and is set to feature in the upcoming sequel.Oh Kenneth, where do we start? Ever since *that* version of 'Hamlet', Brannagh has been one of our favourite stars to swoon over. Since leaving the Wizarding World, Kenneth has turned his attention to directing, as well as starring in flicks such as 'My Week With Marilyn' and 'Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit'.In between stints studying for a degree at Brown University in the US, Emma starred in a number of blockbusters including 'The Bling Ring' and 'The Perks Of Being A Wallflower'. Shortly after graduating in 2013, it was announced that Emma has accepted a UN post and will serve as a Women's Goodwill Ambassador.Gary's a very busy man and has totted up an extensive list of appearances since his Harry Potter days. These include: 'The Dark Knight' and 'The Dark Knight Rises' and 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes'. He also voiced Viktor Reznov and Daniel Clarke in the 'Call of Duty' games.What can we say? The inimitable Helena Bonham Carter played the role of Bellatrix to disturbing perfection and played similarly creepy parts in many other movies. To be honest, if Voldy had left her in charge, he probably would have triumphed. Helena was the perfect Madame Thernardier in 'Les Miserables' and also gave a stellar performance as Elizabeth Taylor in a BBC television film.Shirley Henderson appeared in just a couple of the movies as the ghoul skulking around the toilets. Since then, she voiced the Gruffalo's child in the film of the same name and also starred in 'Soutchliffe', 'Filth' and 'Death In Paradise'.
Full-back Scott Golbourne held his hands up to a “killer” blunder that dealt a heavy blow to Wolves ’ promotion ambitions.“The mistake made by myself has killed us because although we still had quite a bit of time we struggled to create,” he said.With the West Midlands derby finely poised at 1-1, Golbourne hesitated in possession and allowed Blues youngster Demarai Gray to race through on goal and score on the hour mark.Wolves huffed and puffed, but couldn’t find an equaliser as they slipped to a first defeat in seven and out of the top six on goal difference.Golbourne admitted the error rocked his confidence and that he dwelt on it during the match at St Andrew’s.“I was more disappointed with giving the ball away straight after when I was thinking about what had just happened,” the 27-year-old said.“That was a warning sign for me really that I had to move on – it was done – and I couldn’t let it affect the rest of the game.“You just have to learn from these things.“It doesn’t happen very often – normally I would get hold of that and shove it back to (goalkeeper) Kemes, but I just couldn’t get it out of my feet quick enough.“I would like to think I would make the same decision and get it right next time.“You have to look at mistakes and failures as a chance to learn.”Wolves, and Golbourne in particular, have a fairly immediate chance to make amends at high-flying Middlesbrough tomorrow night.“It is a good thing sometimes when the games come thick and fast.“You have got another game to put things right and have another crack at getting some points on the board.“We have given ourselves a good chance of being successful this year.”Kenny Jackett’s men are now eight points adrift of the automatic promotion places.Scott Golbourne of Wolverhampton Wanderers stands dejected after the 2nd goal to make 2-1And Golbourne said the defeat had effectively ruled Wolves out of an unlikely top two finish.“It was a great opportunity (against Blues) to pick up some points and keep it tight up there,” he said.“We did have one eye on the automatic places at the start of the afternoon.“It is still tight for the play-offs, but we have gifted a few too many goals over the last couple of games.
Two versions of the track will be released on May 4thA BRITISH record label is preparing to release a vinyl featuring what it calls ‘the wit of Nigel Farage ’ - featuring mostly nothing but SILENCE.The Wit and Wisdom of Nigel Farage will be released on May 4th by Oxford-based Alcopop! Records.Side A of the 7” vinyl is completely blank, save for ‘a few natural crackles or pops’, according to the label. Side B contains an ‘ambient noise mix’ featuring tumbleweed, chirping seagulls and dripping taps.The latter has been remixed by Rou Reynolds of experimental rock band Enter Shikari, and is described by the label’s co-founder Jack Clothier as “an amplification of what we think is going on in his head - which is not a lot”.The record has been inspired by 1970s rock music label Stiff Records, which released a similarly silent record as a statement about former US President Ronald Reagan.Clothier, better known as Jack pOp, said: “We’re not particularly political, but it strikes me that Farage is a real kind of potential danger.“He is brilliant at the press game: he comes across as quite moderate in a really slick manner. He has all kinds of ideas that would just be so detrimental if he were to get any hint of power in a coalition.“We thought we’d use the little power we have to remind people that they should look at his policies rather than at his slick media image.”This is not the first time Alcopop! has partaken in politics.The record label - which has a band in its roster named Johnny Foreigner - appeared in the public spotlight earlier this year when it attempted to buy UKIP’s website domain. UKIP.org went offline onJanuary 6th after the political party appeared to have forgotten to renew the web address lease.A ‘hearty proportion’ of the profits from the sale of the EP will be donated to the Migrants Rights Network. The tracks are also available to stream for free on Soundcloud.A UKIP spokesman could not offer comment, saying that the party “hadn’t heard about that before”.Try our quick news quiz below:
Katherine Jenkins is pregnant with a little girl.The mezzo-soprano announced the news with a touching message on Instagram, featuring a picture of her and Andrew on their wedding day and a pair of pink baby booties.She wrote: "Couldn't be more excited to meet our little girl! #MummyToBe #DaddyToBe #ArtProject #Collaboration #Family @andrewlevitas"It will be her and husband Andrew Levitas first child, after marrying at Hampton Court Palace.Katherine began dating the American artist and film director in Febuary 2014.After a whirlwind romance the pair got engaged in April and married in September.They also had a religious blessing in Katherine’s hometown Neath.The couple married towards the end of last yearLast year Katherine revealed she was hoping to have a baby soon.She said: “Now I’m married I do want kids.“In fact rumours have started that I’m already expecting. My manager called me last week and asked, ‘Are you pregnant?’“I’m like, ‘You saw me drinking champagne last week, come on!’“It’s so funny, when you get engaged they say, ‘When are you getting married?’The couple only started dating at the start of 2014“Then when you get ­married they’re like, ‘When are you having babies?’“But I do really want a family. Please God, touch wood, we’ll be lucky and they’ll be fit and healthy. That’s all I care about.“I’m promoting my new album until Christmas, then I’m touring the UK in February and March.“Then I’ve got to do it in other places around the world. At that point, it might be nice to take a little bit of time out and see what happens.“Having kids is on the list of priorities. We’ll see what happens.”
Paris city council has voted in favour of the city bidding to host the 2024 Olympics.The French capital hosted the summer Games in 1924, but it lost out to London in 2005 when applying for the 2012 edition.The French National Olympic Committee (CNOSF) had ordered a feasibility study into Paris' suitability, which its City Hall has approved.CNOSF must now formally declare Paris' candidacy before 15 September.Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo said the CNOSF "did a fantastic job and asked the right questions about our past failures".In addition to being passed over for the 2012 Games, Paris was also unsuccessful with bids for the 1992 and 2008 Games,Boston, Hamburg  and Rome have all expressed interest in staging the 2024 Games, with the final decision on the host city to be made in 2017.
While many online April Fools' Day jokes give themselves away by promising gadgets too good to be true, others are so good they simply demand to be brought to life.US company Hyperkin - maker of a popular series of video game consoles that display old games cartridges on modern TV sets - teased retro gaming fans on Reddit this week with an iPhone case that doubled as a Game Boy player.After making it to the coveted front page of the forum site, Hyperkin's April Fools' gag was so widely shared and its supporters so vocal in their lamentations that it was just a joke, the company now has plans to turn the product into reality.The original prank image shows a grey and maroon brick that features a wide slot for inserting an iPhone 6 Plus, and also has a standard Game Boy slot for playing old Game Boy and Game Boy Color games.Hyperkin says the specifics of the device, which is calls the Smart Boy, may change if it does end up making it to market, but that it plans on making it compatible with devices other than the iPhone 6 Plus."We wanted to create a retro device that can be easily adapted into any modern gamer's arsenal of devices," Hyperkin product developer Chris Gallizzi said in a press release.The planned device would work with a phone app that upscales the old games to make them display more pleasingly on the newer screen, and it would also feature the ability to save a game, meaning an old copy of Pokemon Blue will be playable even though the internal battery has long since died.Even though Hyperkin has had success with previous consoles that use Nintendo's cartridges, this will be the first time it attempts to recreate one of the Japanese giant's products so closely.Given Nintendo's recent announcement that it will be entering the mobile gaming space itself, it will be interesting to see if Hyperkin can make it to market before the lawyers come calling.
The two men charged with sexual intercourse without consent and gross indecency appeared in the Darwin Magistrates Court yesterday.The 18-year-old was refused bail while the 33-year-old will apply for release on April 16.Defence lawyer Sheetal Balakrishnan said her client – the younger accused – told police the sex had been consensual.Ms Balakrishnan said the woman, 43, only ran to tell people nearby she had been raped once her client refused to give her money.“Consent is crucial in this matter,’’ she said.Ms Balakrishnan said that the victim was “highly ­intoxicated”.“The police interview had to be paused on four occasions while she was sick,’’ she said.However magistrate Michael Carey poked holes in the young man’s story, who claimed he was by himself until police showed him CCTV images that proved otherwise.Mr Carey that said it was also “hard to imagine” the ­incident taking place in a public toilet – as the accused claimed – when his accomplice was in a wheelchair.The victim alleged the assault took place on the ground.Prosecutor Anna Swindley told the court the 33-year-old man had made admissions to police about the incident that supported the woman’s story.Ms Swindley said he was told by the young man earlier in the night, “I’m going to rape this woman”.The man in the wheelchair allegedly told police his co-offender threatened to stab him unless he closed the woman’s mouth during the assault.Mr Carey refused the man bail and ordered him to appear by video link on May 27.Police arrested the men this week over the alleged incident on March 22.
A 40-year-old man is in hospital with serious burns after a suspected drug lab in Armadale caught fire on Thursday night.Just after 8.45pm, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services was called to Cordelia Road to put out the fire. St John Ambulance was also called out and took the man to Fiona Stanley Hospital with burns to his body.Police say items located at the site were consistent with an improvised drug manufacturing.Police are continuing their inquiries and want anyone with information to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
Josh Smith, a 30-year-old blogger on finance, was in the midst of a career change in 2009 when he sought to refinance $8,000 in credit card debt."At the time, I was making the transition to freelance," he said. "When I asked the bank, they did not want to lend me the money because I was leaving a permanent position for freelance."Smith turned to the online marketplace Lending Club and had a deal within six days."Getting a peer-to-peer loan was incredibly simple," he told AFP.Led by companies such as Lending Club, which went public in December, borrowing money from other individuals and groups via Internet marketplaces has surged in the United States.The volume of loans made through intermediaries like Lending Club has jumped an average of 84 percent each quarter since 2007, according to PriceWaterhouseCoopers.Total loans reached $5.5 billion in 2014 and are projected to hit $150 billion or more in 2025, the accounting firm said in a February report."Think of them as eBays for money," Consumer Reports magazine said in January."Just as eBay brings buyers and sellers together, peer-to-peer platforms bring borrowers in need of loans from $1,000 to $35,000 together with investors who want to earn better returns than those offered by banks."Peer lending platforms can give borrowers better rates than conventional banks, while providing investors a higher yield in an era of low interest rates.The interest rate varies with the risk and generally falls between six and 12 percent. Prospective borrowers are vetted as they would be at conventional banks, but the process is more rapid.The companies that serve as intermediaries typically charge between 0.5 and 5.0 percent of the sum borrowed.The market is booming for peer-lending brokers as banks remain cautious about opening up their loan books in the wake of the 2008 crisis, and being pressed with tighter regulations.California-based Prosper Marketplace has facilitated $1 billion in loans the last five months and is aiming for $3 billion in 2015, said chief executive Aaron Vermut."What I think changed after the crisis of 2008 is that the big banks really left a big vacuum in the lending space," Vermut said.To limit the risk for lenders, companies like Lending Club and Prosper split loans among different investors. The default rate is three to four percent, according to the website Lend Academy.Goldman Sachs said earlier this month that seven percent of the bank industry's annual $150 billion profits could be at risk from new credit sources in the next five years.That is pressing conventional banks to refashion themselves to keep up with the new online competition."Emerging players will force the incumbents to change competitive behavior," Goldman Sachs said. "We would expect pricing of products to adjust, driving potentially lower returns."Nessa Feddis, a senior vice president at the American Bankers Association, said large banks would adjust if demand for alternative lending stays high."The industry does not see it as a threat. It sees an opportunity," she said. "Many of the banks are indirectly involved with peer-to-peer lending as lenders. Also banks, like other businesses, learn from the competition and evolve."But Feddis said there was a need for regulators to ensure a "level playing field" between banks and the emerging class of financial players. For example, banks are kept to strict capital requirements not faced by alternative lenders.But that marks a big difference between the two approaches: peer lending platforms do not take deposits like banks to make their own loans, but are just brokers who take a fee for matching lenders and borrowers.Meanwhile Vermut said his firm is already "very transparent" about its fee structures.
Frank Underwood's murderous and Machiavellian pursuit of power will be extended for another term after acclaimed political drama "House of Cards" was confirmed for a fourth season on Thursday.The return of the award-winning Netflix series, starring Kevin Spacey as the scheming US politician who plots a path to the White House, was confirmed on the show's Twitter feed."I will leave a legacy #Underwood 2016," a brief post read, above an image carrying the message "Season 4 2016."The series showrunner and writer Beau Willimon meanwhile added on Twitter: "Official - S4 of @HouseofCards announced. But the writers & I have been secretly writing for months hehe."Based on a BBC drama from the post-Thatcher years, "House of Cards," co-starring Robin Wright as Mrs Underwood, has so far collected four Emmy awards and two Golden Globes.The show marked Netflix's debut in original programming, which has grown to include other highly regarded shows such as "Orange is the New Black."Netflix meanwhile announced on Thursday plans for its latest new drama series, a supernatural mystery series set in the New York state tourist resort of Montauk.The eight-episode series -- called "Montauk" -- will premiere exclusively via Netflix in 2016.A Netflix statement said the series, written and directed by Matt and Ross Duffer would be set in Montauk in 1980, revolving around the intrigue which is uncovered when a young boy vanishes into thin air."Matt and Ross are emerging filmmakers with an unmistakable passion for genre and suspense. Their unique voice infuses this coming of age drama with supernatural thrills that will captivate our global audience," said Cindy Holland, vice president of original content for Netflix.The Duffer brothers will serve as executive producers for the series along with Shawn Levy and Dan Cohen, Netflix said.
It looked set to be a long Easter weekend for the four Central Coast candidates awaiting their fate from the New South Wales election.When Gosford candidate Kathy Smith got a call from NSW Labor state secretary Jamie Clements, it was a very pleasant surprise."They went in and continued counting this morning, and came out with 76 and it's been declared. I've been declared the winner," Mrs Smith said.The former Chairwoman of Cancer Voices NSW defeated Chris Holstein, the one Liberal member on the Central Coast who was untouched by the ICAC investigations, and able to contest the election."I feel absolutely ecstatic after all the doubt, and the up and down, and you know I'd be five votes minus, then I'd be 20 plus."It's been swings and roundabouts, but now it's come in with a concise win," she said.After talking to thousands of people, followed by a stressful week of not knowing whether or not she had been successful, Mrs Smith was silenced not by her rivals, but rather laryngitis."Something inside me was saying I would get up," she said.In The Entrance, David Mehan, who has previously contested several state and federal elections for the ALP, won a tight battle against Liberals' Michael Sharpe.Despite losing the election, Labor now holds three of the four Central Coast seats.It remains to be seen whether there will be a recount in either seat due to the closeness of the result.
Loud, long and laughably over-the-top, Furious 7 is one of the best pure action movies ever made.A guarantee: Thanks to the adrenaline rush, giddy fans of The Fast and the Furious franchise will be intoxicated by the relentless and spectacular action scenes. These elaborate sequences push Furious 7 to 137 minutes.A probability: They may even shed a tear for Paul Walker as Furious 7 finishes off with an intensely emotional yet quietly reverential denouement. Dominic Toretto’s gruff lectures about family are made heartbreakingly real.A possibility: Furious 7 will mark the end game for the Vin Diesel’s crew and future sequels will spinoff in other directions. Jason Statham will certainly return as the badass villain and Kurt Russell makes a great impression as Mr. Nobody, warranting some more work in the series. Nathalie Emmanuel is eye candy as the super-hacker Megan Ramsey.As for Furious 7 itself, there is absolutely nothing intelligent, nor clever about it. But horror director James Wan (who launched his career with the original Saw movie) packs it with action from beginning to almost the end. Furious 7 opens with a hospital carnage sequence in London, wreaks havoc in the Republic of Azerbaijan, destroys a trio of towers in Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates and moves on to a cataclysmic climax in Los Angeles, where our heroic outlaws fight the evildoers on an epic scale. Some side scenes are set in Japan (which reunites us briefly with Tokyo Drift's Lucas Black) and the Dominican Republic.The filmmakers, of course, did not shoot in some of those places. Furious 7 was filmed in Tokyo, Abu Dhabi, Los Angeles and various U.S. locations in Colorado and Georgia.Some words of warning: If you do not enjoy action movies, Furious 7 is obviously not for you. There is no clever plot. This is not a James Bond film. The storyline is just another excuse to get the crew back behind the wheels of their fast and furious vehicles. Meanwhile, if you do like action but thought Furious 6 (2013) was so extreme, so ridiculous and so illogical that you lost interest — especially during the infamous long runway scenes — Furious 7 will drive you nuts. It is even more extreme. That, however, is a wonderful thing for millions who like this kind of insanity.Furious 7 was written for Wan by Chris Morgan, who has been with the series since Fast Five (2011). After the death of Walker — on a break during production — Morgan tweaked the script and came up with that tribute scene at the end. Thanks to Diesel, who handles raw emotion with respect and tenderness without ever losing his cool, the tribute works.What is unsettling is that there are a couple of moments in the movie where it is obvious that Paul Walker’s brothers stood in for him to complete his scenes as Bryan O'Connor. In particular, the family beach scene seems odd on that level, but it might have been the tears in my eyes that distorted the images.As for the upbeat parts of Furious 7, the plane drop sequence — in which the crew parachutes into Azerbaijan inside their vehicles — is breathtaking. So is the subsequent mayhem on the highway, with the highly effective Statham as the joker in the deck. But my favourite thrill in the movie is the triple-tower, flying-car routine. Wow!Director Wan and his stunt team expertly move from gigantic set pieces — with cars, trucks, buses, helicopters, drones, missiles and other equipment — to intimate fight scenes — where men and women fight hand-to-hand and fist-to-face.The best of those fights involve Statham and Dwayne Johnson (with The Rock back in a reduced, yet significant role) and Statham and Diesel (with Diesel growing a double chin, yet still physically dynamic as a street fighter). You should also watch out in Abu Dhabi for MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, the scariest woman on the planet.By the end of Furious 7, audiences will be exhausted, exhilarated and maybe a little emotional.
They ruled out several potential causes before stumbling on a reason for the 56-year-old Arkansas man’s kidney problems.He said he drank about 16 eight-ounce (about a quarter of a litre) cups of iced tea every day. Black tea has a chemical known to cause kidney stones or even kidney failure in excessive amounts.“It was the only reasonable explanation,” said Dr Umbar Ghaffar of the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences in Little Rock.She and two other doctors describe the case in Thursday’s New England Journal of Medicine.The unidentified man went to the hospital last May with nausea, weakness, fatigue and body aches. Doctors determined his kidneys were badly clogged and inflamed by the food chemical called oxalate. The man is on dialysis, perhaps for the rest of his life, Ghaffar said.Besides black tea, oxalate is found in spinach, rhubarb, nuts, wheat bran and chocolate. In rare cases, too much oxalate can lead to kidney trouble, but often there’s also a contributing intestinal problem. That didn’t seem to be the case for the Arkansas man, and he had no family or personal history of kidney disease.At 16 cups of iced black tea each day, he was taking in three to 10 times more oxalate than the average American, Ghaffar and her colleagues reported.Federal studies suggest that, on average, US adults drink a total of 10 or 11 cups of beverages per day - that’s water, coffee and all other liquids combined.Ghaffar didn’t know if the man drank sugar-sweetened iced tea - the way it is usually served in the South. While he’d had diabetes, that didn’t cause his kidney problems, she said.The Arkansas case appears to be very unusual, said Dr Randy Luciano, a Yale School of Medicine kidney specialist who has treated people with kidney damage from too much oxalate.“I wouldn’t tell people to stop drinking tea,” said Luciano, who was not involved in the research. What the man drank “is a lot of tea.”
A strong tropical storm system heading towards Hong Kong could trigger the earliest storm warning signal hoisted in the city in nearly half a century this weekend.Typhoon Maysak – currently churning across the eastern Philippine Sea – will weaken into a tropical storm when it is expected to reach 800km of Hong Kong on Sunday, according to the Observatory’s forecast today.If that happens, it may trigger the earliest storm warning signal in the city in 48 years.Maysak, which has already weakened into a typhoon, was centred about 990km east of Manila at 12pm on Friday.Previously it was classified as a severe typhoon, packing winds of up to 184km/h. A typhoon is one grade lower, with winds between 118km/h and 149km/h.The Observatory said Maysak was moving west or west-northwest at about 20km/h in the general direction of Luzon, and was weakening gradually.According to its forecast, Maysak will reach 800km of Hong Kong on Sunday morning and will weaken into a tropical storm by that time.A stand-by signal No 1 may be raised when a storm reaches 800km of Hong Kong.A warning signal on Sunday will be the earliest one since 1967. The present record was a standby No 1 triggered by Typhoon Violet on April 9 that year.

Spending all your nights sleeping on buses seems a grim fate. But that’s the existence some people endure, writes Damian Zane.Heathrow airport is pretty empty at 2am. One of the few people around is a man waiting for a bus.It’s part of his nightly ritual as he seeks shelter on London’s network of night buses.This is Ahmed, not his real name, a 44-year-old failed asylum seeker from India. He’s wrapped in a large cream, canvas coat, with a thick brush of grey hair combed to one side.Ahmed starts his journey at about 11pm in Leicester Square, in the heart of tourist London, packed full of people throughout most of the night.“With all these people going to the pubs and clubs, you can stay here until four o’clock in the morning,” he says.But Ahmed’s typical nightly route starts with the number 24 to Hampstead Heath. Then he gets off, and gets the bus straight back where he came.By the time he reaches central London again, the night buses have started and he can pick one of the longest routes to allow for the most rest.“Sometimes I think about ending my life,” he says, while contemplating the possibility of being arrested and forced to return to India.Ahmed is a Muslim who grew up on a farm in rural Gujarat. Fearing for his life in the communal riots there in 2002, he fled to London. During an earlier bout of violence he’d witnessed his uncle being stabbed to death.Traumatised by that experience and concerned that he could be targeted, he was persuaded by his parents to leave and find a better life outside India.“They said ‘you should go, don’t worry about us’. That day was a very heavy day for me because I [was] leaving my parents alone,” he says.With a visitor’s visa in his passport he flew into Heathrow and applied for asylum. It was rejected. India is considered to be a generally safe country, and certainly big enough for the possibility of restarting a life away from Gujarat.Ahmed’s appeal was also refused and he was told to return to India. But instead he chose to silently drop out of the system, fearing the consequences of returning home.Not being allowed to work, he had no income and soon began sleeping rough – in doorways and behind bins, occasionally a bed in a shelter. Eventually he heard about the bus option, and has since spent much of the past three-and-a-half years sleeping on night buses.And during that time, he’s picked up certain techniques to remain undetected.But Ahmed has also learned other methods to improve his chances of a good sleep.He rushes to the front of the queue, he says, because there are others like him and everyone clamours for the seats on the lower deck, above the engine at the back, where it’s warmest.Ahmed says it’s easy to spot others in a similar situation. Many are dressed in jeans and layers of hooded sweatshirts to keep out the cold, often avoiding eye contact in an effort not to be noticed.At one stop, he points out migrants who he’s travelled on the buses with before. It’s a fleeting glimpse of some sort of camaraderie between these night travellers, but they all have their own individual struggles to contend with, which can hamper the development of strong friendships.Ahmed is one of thousands of failed asylum seekers, as well as people awaiting the outcome of appeals, drifting through London, often unrealistically hoping their circumstances will suddenly change.No accurate count of their numbers exists. It’s inherently difficult to count people who have dropped off the radar. A report last year said that the Home Office is unaware how many of the 175,000 people who have no right to be in the UK still remain.On the bus, Ahmed grabs some rest whenever he can.He says he has a recurring dream. “It’s like somebody’s after me, they’re going to hit me or stab me.” Ahmed says that some people in the same situation can be hostile, pushing and shouting at him.But his constant fear is of being discovered by authorities. So he adopts a common survival strategy – never cause trouble and never be where trouble is happening.On the busy Friday and Saturday night buses, things can get rowdy, he says, making it difficult to sleep. But if ever that rowdiness escalates into violence, Ahmed is off at the next stop, keen to avoid being there if police are called.He’s not entirely alone in his struggle to survive in London. A mosaic of organisations exists in the city to help migrants and asylum seekers. They can provide piecemeal help in the form of small cash hand-outs, legal advice, a hot meal and a shower.Three times a week Ahmed visits a centre in east London where he can wash himself and his clothes. He also stores two plastic bags holding his possessions there. At another of these charities, Ahmed cooks in return for travel money to ride his buses. After the meal, Ahmed plays table tennis and Scrabble with other migrants.A free meal and the chance of companionship is a big draw.“I love cooking, I’m happy if the people are eating and bless me,” he says. “It means more to me than getting my papers to stay. It’s by people’s blessing that things will get sorted out.”But these moments of pleasure and purpose are just short punctuations in long stretches of loneliness. And once the centre closes for the day Ahmed is back on the buses.“Last night my leg was paining me, my whole body was aching, and now the weather’s getting cold,” he says. “Two winters I passed on the buses and it was quite difficult. It’s very difficult to survive in the winter time.”We board the night bus to Heathrow Airport. At 80 minutes, it’s one of the longest routes on the network.But arriving at an airport raises the nagging question about what is so wrong with returning to India. In the UK he has no job, no place to live and no security. It is hard to imagine what could be worse than this.Yet Ahmed is adamant. “I can’t go. Back home I have a more dangerous situation and persecution. So I’m not ready to go back to India.“If my situation is getting worse then there may be no alternative for me [but to kill myself]. I always pray that I never get caught and sent back to India.”But how much longer can he continue?Another couple of years, Ahmed says. He clings to the hope that once he’s been in the UK for 12 years he’ll be allowed to stay officially. But that optimism is not backed up by the law.Such a provision – after 14 years, not 12 – did exist until 2012. People living in the UK – either legally or illegally – for that time could then apply for leave to remain. That period has now been lengthened to 20 years.And unless Ahmed decides to return to India, or gets caught, that means many more hours of waiting, and many more night buses.
After the anxiety and drama of the past few days in Nigeria, it is tempting to get carried away by the impact of this ballot – what it represents for both Africa’s largest democracy and for those countries on the continent still wrestling with the notion that power can change hands without the world coming to an end.The significance of General Muhammadu Buhari’s victory should certainly not be underestimated.An electorate that has savoured the rich experience of ousting an incumbent by the mere act of voting cannot easily be persuaded to forget it.And that must surely be a contagious experience on a continent where, it is often said, roughly one in five people are Nigerians.Besides, this was no “people’s revolution” – something that the continent’s remaining strongmen could loudly dismiss as a dangerous threat to the natural order of things.Instead Nigeria’s election was something much more prosaic, and more subtle – a challenge to entrenched autocracy.It was, despite the disruptive efforts of a few, a very ordinary thing: A peaceful, modern, well-monitored, uncontestable transfer of power.Nothing to be feared. A casual precedent that should echo loudly around the region.“It establishes a link between performance and accountability – knowing that if you don’t perform you can be thrown out of power by the electorate, not by the military,” Adekeye Adebajo, from the Centre for Conflict Resolution in Cape Town, told me by phone.“It’s an incredibly powerful incentive for better governance in the future.“It sends a strong signal to the rest of the continent. There will be autocrats in Khartoum, in the DRC, Rwanda and Uganda, who are thinking of staying on in power. They won’t welcome this.”The election also gives Nigeria more credibility and clout within the West African grouping Ecowas, at the African Union, and internationally, as the continent seeks to shrug off the enduring influence of former colonial powers like France.Nigeria’s leaders can no longer be dismissed as hypocrites when they lecture neighbours like Mali, Niger, Guinea and Guinea Bissau, on the need to keep the military out of politics. That can only be a good thing for African democracy.On a more nuts and bolts level, these past few days have been a valuable reminder of quite how difficult it is becoming to rig an election.Social media, fingerprint scanners, and an army of young volunteer observers armed with mobile phones have all played their role – as they have done in other recent African elections – in limiting the possibilities of ballot stuffing and other shenanigans.That’s not to say people didn’t try to rig this election – and won’t in the future.But once the data is out there – posted online – it becomes much harder for the backroom cheats to cook the books.Then there’s President Goodluck Jonathan’s abrupt decision to accept defeat – a move made, I’m told, without consulting some key officials and against the wishes of many in his party.It was a bold, selfless move that may well have saved many lives in Nigeria.It will go down as a new milestone for African democracy, and may help redeem Mr Jonathan’s presidency, at least partially, in the eyes of his many critics.Does that mean Nigerian democracy is safe? Perhaps not.A new man may be coming to power. But Gen Buhari is not young, and he presides over an untested coalition. He is inheriting an empty treasury – broken by falling oil prices, the cost of supporting the national currency, and now threatened with more looting by sticky-fingered officials heading for the door.Boko Haram’s insurgency in the north-east remains a huge challenge to a corrupt and humiliated army. Perennial frustrations in the oil-rich south of Nigeria could well begin to boil over. The list goes on. And now comes a six-week period of administrative limbo – another new experience for Nigeria – as the old regime prepares to empty its desks, and a new team is formed.Gen Buhari has much to do, and to prove, in a short time. Who will he chose to run the economy? How can he prevent any last-minute looting? Can he get the army to secure, and build on the territorial gains it has made against Boko Haram in the last few weeks? And how will he balance the need for a smooth transition against what must surely be his instinct to make an example of those public officials who have been greedily stealing from Nigeria’s oil revenues for years?Nigeria, by all accounts, is not an easy country to run. As we saw on Tuesday night with the state television’s reluctance to even broadcast news of an election upset, there are entrenched interests here that will struggle to adapt. After a political earthquake, aftershocks are almost inevitable. But for now it is the optimists both in Nigeria and around the continent who must, surely, have the upper hand.The uncontestable fact of a democratic transfer of power trumps any legitimate, but unrealised concerns about whether a different president, and a different party, will actually make life better for the people of Africa’s most important nation.
A RAIL commuter who dodged his fare by forging Metro cards worth more than £7,000 was spared jail by a judge who labelled his offending "nasty and mean."Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Colin Dunne: "There will be many people who would dearly like to see me send you to prison."Dunne was sent to Bradford Crown Court for sentence by magistrates after he pleaded guilty to making and possession of false Metro cards and fraud by false representation.Dunne, 50, of Hunters Park Avenue, Clayton, Bradford, used the forged cards to travel to work on Network Rail for free between Bradford and Skipton for seven months, prosecutor Emma Downing said yesterday.Dunne was overheard discussing the fraud with a woman travelling on the train with him on September 18 last year.He was arrested and charged the following month while using one of his fake cards.Police found 106 of the cards on him and blank cards at his home.Miss Downing said officers seized them and Dunne's computer, printer and scanner.He told the police he was short of money but the court heard his partner was giving him £30 a week to cover his travel costs. He was deceiving her and pocketing the cash.Miss Downing said Dunne had saved £714 on rail fares over seven months.His barrister, Mark McKone, said this was the first time he had done anything like this.He was a hard working man who deeply regretted his actions. He had not caused a vast amount of loss to the rail company.Dunne's partner had thrown him out when she found out about the fraud but the couple were now reconciled, the court heard.Judge Durham Hall said it was a planned and sophisticated fraud that rail commuters would find intolerable."It is infuriating to think that people are dodging fares. The rail company is put to great expense putting exit checks at even the smallest of stations because people like you are avoiding paying their fares," he said.But Dunne was a hard working man on a modest income.Although the case crossed the custody threshold, he did not need to go straight to prison."Don't be so silly again, please," the judge told him.Dunne was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with 180 hours of unpaid work.He must pay £714 compensation to Northern Rail and £425 court costs.
The finalists for the prestigious Man Booker International Prize have been announced.  Ten authors from around the world are contending for the £60,000 ($117,000) prize.  It is awarded every two years to an author who has published fiction either originally in English or whose work is generally available in English.  The Man Booker International Prize is different from the annual Man Booker in that the judges consider a writer's body of work rather than a single novel.  The finalists are: Cesar Aira (Argentina), Hoda Barakat (Lebanon), Maryse Conde (Guadeloupe), Mia Couto (Mozambique), Amitav Ghosh (India), Fanny Howe (US), Ibrahim al-Koni (Libya), Leszlo Krasznahorkai (Hungary), Alain Mabanckou (Republic of Congo) and Marlene van Niekerk (South Africa).  "This is a most interesting and enlightening list of finalists. It brings attention to writers from far and wide, so many of whom are in translation," said Jonathan Taylor, chairman of the Booker Prize Foundation.  The list of finalists was announced at the University of Cape Town, South Africa, on Tuesday by writer and academic Professor Marina Warner, chairwoman of the five-person judging panel.  "The judges have had an exhilarating experience reading for this prize. We have ranged across the world and entered the vision of writers who offer an extraordinary variety of experiences," she said.  "The novel today is in fine form."  The winner will be announced at a ceremony in London on May 19.  Previous winners have been Lydia Davis (2013), Philip Roth (2011), Alice Munro (2009), Chinua Achebe (2007) and Ismail Kadare, who won the inaugural prize in 2005.  AFP
Once parents decide to focus on good parenting, they need to begin character education immediately, for it is the foundation on which all else is built. The reward will be priceless.CHARACTER BUILDING STARTS in infancy during the formative years of child development. It is precisely during these valuable stages of childhood that many fundamental aspects of one’s personality traits are formed.Unfortunately, however, most of the leadership-training programs which exist are directed toward adults, not children. Human development literature in Muslim countries is primarily addressed to adults in high school or to those at college level and beyond.What is meant by “character building?” Basic traits (like courage, love, freedom, honesty, responsibility, and creativity) constitute the essential components of the human personality and start developing from early infancy. Once set, they are difficult to undo, replace, or build later on in life. It is these characteristics which form the basis of one’s future personality, and therefore, parents need to spend time and effort in nurturing them to the best of their ability. Although knowledge, experience, and skills are all important qualities for success, they come later and can be developed as children grow into adulthood. They serve an important function, contributing to the further refinement of the basic traits, to guide and enrich people to become betterand wiser human beings. If the basic characteristics form the “hardware” of a person’s personality, we may term education and faith the “software’: Someone who is a coward will not suddenly become brave later on in adulthood by simply taking a course on courage. Similarly, someone who is full of hate and cruelty will not suddenly become truly loving and caring by reading books on love and compassion. A liar does not automatically become honest and trustworthy by listening to advice on honesty. For most people, once their basic personality traits are formed (defining who they are and how they behave) it would be difficult to change them or to reshape their “hardware”. The easiest and best way to instill the finest qualities is during the formative years of childhood.The examples of Abu Bakr al-Siddiq, ‘Umar ibn al-Khattab, Khalid ibn al- Walid, and other Companions are notable. They teach us that the qualities of courage, trust, honesty, and leadership were already present in the character of these men, having been nurtured during their childhood. Islam complemented this good character by affirming the notable elements of their personality and adding faith, wisdom, and knowledge. Islam was able to inspire them with the sense of a civilized mission and imbue them with a new meaning, world view, and purpose to their lives. The firmness of their character did not diminish after they had embraced the new religion but continued to grow in strength. The Qur’an explains this phenomenon, applicable to the prophets as well as other human beings, when it mentions that once man has grown up and attained middle age God grants him knowledge and wisdom.The Prophet (PBUH) said: People are like minerals [or metals, having their own character]; the best of people in the [pre-Islamic] age of ignorance (jahiliyyah) are the best of them in [the age of] Islam, if they understand [and comprehend]. (AL-BUKHARI AND MUSLIM) A good police officer and a bad criminal both need to possess courage and loyalty to be ef- fective in their performance and useful to their groups. However, the police officer usesthese characteristics to serve society, whereas the criminal uses them for harmful ends. Al- though courage and loyalty are necessary, they need to be value-oriented to be beneficial, otherwise they can be harmful and destructive. Islam normally gives general guidance on most issues, yet it offers a more detailed road map when it comes to the family. Islam outlines a comprehensive family system and gives guidance on choosing a spouse, getting engaged, and writing the marriage contract (including the role of guardians and witnesses). Islam also gives guidance on sexual conduct, pregnancy, abortion, delivery, naming the baby, lineage, breastfeeding, baby care, wills and guardianship, education and training, gender differences and similarities, inheritance, child rights and duties, delinquency, care of orphans, adoption, widowhood, parenting and child raising, divorce, alimony, waiting period for marriage (after divorce or the demise of the husband), cessation period, menstruation, sib- ling relations, extended family, family bonds, grandparents, grandchildren, neighbors, and the dress code. Parenting has to be regarded as a futuristic endeavor because it is responsible for preparing the high quality cadres of society, including its creative thinkers, wise scholars, hard workers, brave soldiers, strong athletes, and the great world leaders of human civilizations.The following sections help parents focus on character building and educational development programs.This section will deal with phases of human development necessary to allow parents to visualize the gradual development of their child from one stage to the next and to thereby understand better the peculiar needs of each stage. Whilst outlining the development status of the human body and mind during the years of growth, parents will also be shown how to capitalize on several aspects relative to each stage to optimize the outcome of parenting.For example, some parents force their children to eat more, but they resist defiantly. Later on, their appetite suddenly increases and they begin to eat more, voluntarily. This is not due to the parents’ insistence, but to nat-ural growing up. Similarly, teenagers may suddenly revolt against parents and the environment’ yet, as they grow up, this attitude subsides owing to the natural phases of development. Doctors advise parents to be fully aware when development milestones are reached. Not reaching these milestones at a certain age should sound an alarm that there might be a serious health problem.A parent’s best protection is to be well informed. They should not be afraid to ask their family physician for explanations. Nor should they be worried if their child does not reach each stage on time. Babies insist upon developing at their own pace. Although the development of a child follows a general human genetic pattern, it is also unique for each individual. To be successful, parents should set aside their dreams for their children and help them attain their own dreams. Children are not like their parents, for they possess an independent personality. Parents are advised to let reality be reality and adopt the pace of nature whose secret is patience.

The papers were quick to react to the party leaders' televised election debate after it finished late in the evening.The Times focuses on the performances of the SNP's Nicola Sturgeon and UKIP's Nigel Farage, the Guardian and the Independent remark on the fragmented nature of party politics, and the Daily Telegraph and the Sun conclude that Labour's Ed Miliband had a bad time.In a leading article, the Times says as expected there were no clear winners among the big parties. "It was the fringe that had its voice heard most strongly," it says. There were no "knock-out blows" as it puts it.The Daily Telegraph describes the debate as "messy" but says there is a simple choice for voters."A full seven candidates stood on stage, reflecting a political spectrum that has broadened and splintered into many different parts since 2010," it says. "And yet the choice faced this May is actually far more straightforward than it first looks."The Guardian says the presence of UKIP, the SNP, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party was a "powerful demonstration of the decline of the main parties".The Sun says it was like watching the warm-up before a sporting cup final - but the game will be won or lost over the next 30-odd days.The Daily Mirror tends to agree: "Last night was last night. This election will still go down to the wire."Looking at the participants' body language, the Times says: "Nicola Sturgeon appeared peppy and confident, echoing Nick Clegg's easy confidence. Natalie Bennett's wooden performance was coupled with a stilted speaking style."Reviewing host Julie Etchingham's performance, Andrew Pettie in the Telegraph says she was "composure itself" in contrast to the party leaders."Fittingly the noisy two-hour debate was filmed in the same studio as telly's often-volatile Jeremy Kyle Show," notes the Sun."Wow. That was exhausting - and all I had to do was sit on my sofa watching it," says Michael Deacon's sketch in the Telegraph."Shout, shout, interruption, shout. The stress of it. It was like sitting through a two-hour penalty shoot-out - between seven different teams.""You had to hope it wasn't an ITV ad booker's joke to run a commercial for Confused.com in the break," writes Donald MacIntyre in the Independent."Because there was quite a lot for the viewer to be puzzled about. Seven party leaders attacking each other from whole different political directions is hardly what we're used to."Commenting in the Daily Express, Leo McKinstry says the format was not conducive to informative discussion or a clear-cut outcome, as the leaders "indulged in rehearsed soundbites, dodgy statistics and hollow bombast".Philip Collins in the Times says the format was ludicrous in strict proportion to the way British politics has become ludicrous.Steve Richards comments in the Independent that there was no clear winner, whatever the instant polls suggest, because "the format gave no space for one individual to flourish".Ann Treneman's political sketch in the Times says there was speculation about whether the fact that three of the leaders were women would change the tone of the debate "and make it, less aggressive, less shouty"."But it was only the women who were taking on Nigel," she writes. "The men just stood there, arguing their points, and looking earnest."In the Daily Mail, Quentin Letts likens the event to quiz show The Weakest Link."Readers, I loved it. What a hoot, a mixture of bar fight, bitchfest and Grand National steeplechase. Oh, all those sideways glances and pouts, and the third-person references to people who were only feet away.""These debates are obviously here to stay. That's fine," concludes Daily Star TV critic Mike Ward. "But as viewers we should lower our expectations."A day after the papers were full of stories about a couple who had won £1m on the Lottery twice within two years comes news of another big win.Retired turkey farmer Richard Maxwell is pictured on the front of the Mirror with his wife Angela after scooping £53m, making him Britain's 10th biggest jackpot winner.He reveals that as he found out about his prize on 1 April he thought it was an April Fool's joke.The Mirror has some ideas how he could spend the money - for example a £39m Gulfstream G650 private jet, a newly built penthouse in South Kensington for £50m, or how about 3.8 million supermarket turkeys.The Times says Mr Maxwell kept the news to himself for four hours until his wife got back from helping at a pensioners' luncheon club.The Daily Express claims at least a tiny part of the credit - it says Mr Maxwell picked up the ticket when he went to but a copy of the newspaper.The couple are from Coningsby in Lincolnshire, which the Sun says is "one of the luckiest counties for Lotto jackpots".The Mirror says: "EuroMillions winners Richard and Angela Maxwell deserved a visit from Lady Luck, as both raise funds for charity and do their bit for the community."And he must be the coolest man in Britain after waiting four hours for his wife to come home so he could break the £53m news."In contrast to the Maxwells, one group of people who have had that sinking feeling is the Oxford University women's rowing team.They were rescued by an RNLI lifeboat after their boat began to take on water on the River Thames while training for the forthcoming Boat Race.The Telegraph says they were fished out of the water by the lifeboat crew which stumbled across the stricken eight by chance.The Times says sinkings are an occupational hazard for crews struggling against the tidal waters of the Thames, and recalls the flooding of the Cambridge men's boat in 1978.It is claimed to be one of the most enviable police posts in the UK says the Times, which reports that Devon and Cornwall Police are advertising for a third officer to work on the Isles of Scilly.The paper says the new bobby is unlikely to be troubled by bank robberies, serial killers or motorway pile-ups on an archipelago where the crime rate is close to zero.Restraining wayward seals or separating drunken chefs fighting over whether sea salt or rock salt is best are more probable challenges - incredibly these are real examples of recent incidents the constabulary has had to deal with.Officers have also had to cope with a short-sighted horse damaging cars, dead fish dumped on the doorstep of the police station and a row over a shed dating back over the past 50 years.Team leader Sgt Colin Taylor posted the job advert on the force's Facebook page which now has more than 20,000 followers, 10 times the entire population of the islands.PC Faye Webb, who is leaving, said: "Whoever takes my job will love it. It is a unique place to police and a lovely small community."Finally, the Mail reports on a study that suggests having a Waitrose supermarket close by increases the value of a house.The research, by Lloyds Bank, found that such homes cost 12% more than those in the surrounding area but not so close to the store - but having an Aldi or a Lidl on your doorstep means your house could be worth less.A cartoon has a couple looking out of their window at a Waitrose store and saying: "It was mainly the views that attracted us to the property."
Connections toyed with the idea of pressing on, but Manion Cup winner Permit has eventually bowed out of racing a winner after being scratched from the Chairman's Handicap. Chris Waller and connections withdrew the rising nine-year-old on Friday, meaning his group 3 win a fortnight ago proved a fitting  end to his career. The one-time Sydney Cup favourite finished with career earnings of more than $700,000 for connections, who  include Victoria Racing Club chairman Michael Burn and Crown Resorts' Rowen Craigie. Early favourite Rising Romance and Martinvast have also been scratched from the Chairman's Handicap. The news was better for Australian Derby contender Ruling Dynasty, which was passed fit  on Friday after an inspection of a foot abscess by  Racing NSW's senior veterinarian Craig Suann. Co-trainers Bart and James Cummings have already advised stewards of plans to ride the horse further forward in the Derby.The Australian Turf Club is bracing for a heavy track as forecast rain on the opening day of The Championships threatens a dramatic downgrade of the Randwick surface. The track was rated in the soft range on Friday evening, but the weather bureau has predicted between 20-40mm of rain will be dumped in the Randwick area. "If we don't get anything it will be a soft 6 and heading towards a [soft] 5, but they're forecasting rain," the ATC's general manager of racecourses, Lindsay Murphy, said. "If it does we'll get to the heavy [range]. We're in the lap of the gods a little bit." The rail will be remain in the true position for the 10-race card.Racing NSW chief steward Ray Murrihy has confirmed that an employee at   Luke Griffith's stable had tested positive for cannabis and was supended for three months on Thursday. David Edwards provided a urine sample at a Scone meeting in February that showed traces of the substance. "I can confirm it's cannabis," Murrihy said. "It's part of an ongoing investigation into samples from Luke Griffith's horses." Stewards backdated the ban to March 26 and Edwards will be able to resume on June 26. Stewards agreed to cut one month off the penalty if he satsifactorily completed a program of professional counselling. Edwards will need to provide a sample free of any banned substance before he is re-instated.Kody Nestor is realistic enough to know Dane De Lago isn't one of the main chances in Saturday's $300,000 Country Championships Final (1400m) at Randwick. But that won't stop the 25-year-old from making the trek to the big smoke for one ride on a day when he would normally be punching around a full book at Broken Hill. For the popular heavyweight rider, who comes from one of Dubbo's most prominent racing families, the opportunity to ride in front of a massive crowd on one of the biggest day's on the calendar was just too big to pass up. Adding to the theatre of Dane De Lago's attempt to pull off a massive upset is the fact the gelding is trainer by Nestor's uncle Peter and is raced by a group of first-time owners. "He's not the best chance in the race but I don't think he's the worst chance either," Kody Nestor said. "I've had a couple of thoughts about what it would be like to win a race like this but then I snap out of it. I have to treat it like any other race."

Micky Adams insists it was a point gained and not two dropped for Tranmere as they drew 2-2 at Stevenage.Rovers were ahead for a large part of the second half, but Charlie Lee’s leveler means they are still in the relegation zone.And although Adams criticised the defending from corners, he had few complaints about the overall performance.“They gave us everything,” he said.“We were unlucky. In the final third we caused problems.“We didn’t defend two set pieces well and ultimately that’s cost us but we showed a lot of spirit and determination there today and we’re going to need that.“We won’t know how good that point is. That will unravel itself at the end of the season.“But it’s a good point. You’d be delighted with that normally, a side pushing for the play-offs.“It’s a Graham Westley side, and that’s not being disrespectful to him, that’s just telling it how it is.“You never get an easy ride here.“I’m trying to look at things as positively as I can, so I’ll take that as a point gained.“We’re disappointed, of course we are.“We’ve put a lot of effort into that game.“Not too many people gave us a prayer here today, but we did.“We think that if we turn up and show the sort of effort and commitment that we did today, we can give anybody top or bottom of the league a game.”One thing that delighted Adams was the way his side reacted to going behind early on.It took just three minutes for Stevenage to take the lead as Bira Dembele nodded home.But the boss praised his team for “rolling their sleeves up” and fighting back.“We didn’t feel sorry for ourselves and got on with it,” he continued.“We came in at half time 2-1 to the good and I thought we were worthy of it because we limited them to few chances.“The first goal, Jennison Myrie-Williams came off the wide area and cut across the pitch which he needs to do if we’re playing Kayode Odejayi up there on his own.“But it was a terrific ball by George Green. Inch perfect.”For all the good work Green did in helping Rovers equalise though, he could so easily have nicked the win.Played through on goal late on, he had only the ‘keeper to beat but stabbed wide.“He wants to put the gloss on a fantastic performance.“But he’s still learning the game. I don’t want to take anything away from him.”
GEORGE Thorne returns to the Derby County starting line-up for Friday night's Championship clash with promotion rivals Watford at the iPro Stadium (7.45pm). The midfielder makes only his third appearance of the season, having recovered from his latest injury setback. Top scorer Chris Martin is named among the substitutes after 10 games out with a hamstring problem, as does Republic of Ireland international Jeff Hendrick (hip). Jesse Lingard drops to the bench to accommodate the inclusion of Thorne, who had a loan spell at Watford. The other change to the side that lost 2-0 at Wolves a fortnight ago sees Ryan Shotton replace Raul Albentosa in central defence in an apparent tactical decision by head coach Steve McClaren. John Eustace (knee), Jake Buxton (back) and Omar Mascarell (foot) remain sidelined. DERBY COUNTY: Grant, Christie, Keogh, Shotton, Forsyth, Thorne, Hughes, Bryson, Ince, Russell, Bent. Subs: Roos (gk), Albentosa, Warnock, Hendrick, Lingard, Ward, Martin.
HONG KONG - Hong Kong families trekked up to hillside cemeteries Friday to burn offerings for their ancestors, with French macaroons proving this year's must-have delicacy for relatives to enjoy in the afterlife.The ancient annual tradition sees thousands of people clamber up the city's hills, despite the hot and humid conditions, to burn incense and sweep relatives' graves in the run-up to the Ching Ming festival, which falls on Sunday.Families traditionally burn likenesses of everything their deceased loved ones could ever want in the hereafter at graveside furnaces -- from false teeth, razors and shirts to chauffeur-driven cars, yachts, mansions and wads of fake cash."This is where the parents of my grandfather are, and we come here to pay our respects once a year because during Ching Ming festival, they will come to receive things," Agnes Poon, who works for a property management firm, said at a cemetery in the city's Diamond Hill district.Poon, 40, said she had burned paper models of shoes, clothes and gold and jewellery and food so that her ancestors could be more comfortable."We believe they will be able to use these items in another world," she said.Others burned bags filled with paper gold while another family burned a large paper model of a sports car.But in a city where shopping is king, modern consumer trends are increasingly shaping the sacrificial gifts."In the past, some people had only burned paper furniture or buildings, now, people are seeking 3D televisions and will look for iPads and iPhones," said Ng Shuk-fong, whose shop in the central Sai Ying Pun neighbourhood is crammed with paper offerings.And the netherworld's taste for luxury is not limited to gadgets.High-end French-style macaroons are the latest big thing in Hong Kong cake shops and now paper versions of the delicate confectionery are winging their way into the furnace too."There are customers...who are specially requesting this product (macaroons) because relatives who passed away had enjoyed eating them," said Ng, 46, whose busy store has been selling the paper likenesses for more than three decades.It is believed that burning offerings for ancestors has been a tradition since the first Chinese emperor in 220 BC.For those in modern-day Hong Kong, undertaking the ritual also gives them peace of mind."There are stories of people having dreams that their deceased relatives told them they were feeling cold," said Shirley Ho, an office clerk with bags full of paper shoes and clothes after shopping at Ng's shop."After they burned the things, it got better."
Speculation over when Joseph O'Brien would return to ride on the Flat has ended after the jockey was declared for two mounts at Cork.O'Brien created a relative media frenzy last weekend by riding over hurdles at Limerick, instead of being in action on the first day of the new season at the Curragh.However, he will compete on the level at Cork, with the rider due to partner East India at 9st 6lb in the www.corkracecourse Rated Stakes and Hans Holbein at 9st 5lb in the Blackwater Maiden.
Tony McCoy will ride Cantlow for his boss JP McManus in the BoyleSports Irish Grand National at Fairyhouse on Monday.The soon-to-retire champion has chosen the Paul Webber-trained 10-year-old over McManus's two other entries in the big handicap chase, top-weight If In Doubt, trained by Philip Hobbs, and Tom Mullins' Alderwood.Cantlow finished eighth last year under Andrew McNamara as McManus lifted the prize with the Barry Geraghty-partnered Shutthefrontdoor.McCoy will be hoping he can be triumphant in the famous green and gold colours and win the race for a second time, having been successful on Butler's Cabin in 2007.Gallant Oscar is not among the final field. Though he had been ante-post favourite before being usurped by Cantlow, connections of the Tony Martin-trained 10-year-old are instead hoping he makes the cut for the Crabbie's Grand National on Saturday week.Gallant Oscar also holds an entry in the Coral Scottish Grand National at Ayr a week later.Robert Tyner's Embracing Change, winner of his last four races, is another high-profile absentee.However, there is a very strong line-up, with Willie Mullins saddling Perfect Gentleman and Dogora as he bids to get on the roll of honour for the first time.Jim Dreaper is double-handed with Los Amigos and Sizing Coal, with Grand Jesture, Pass The Hat, Vics Canvas and Lots Of Memories among the other interesting contenders.Dan Skelton's Toby Lerone is first reserve, while the Noel Meade-trained pair of Bose Ikard and Ipsos Du Berlais take up the other two stand-by places.
George R.R. Martin has revealed he will focus on writing The Winds of Winter insteadAuthor George RR Martin has treated Game of Thrones fans with a peek at the next instalment of the franchise.Fans have been given a special treat ahead of the show's fifth season returning to TV on April 12.Martin has posted excerpts from the sixth book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, which is titled Winds of Winter.Writing on his blog, he said he had wanted to release them earlier but "did not want it mistaken for an April Fool's joke".The first paragraph of the excerpt reads: "She was reading her little lord a tale of the Winged Knight when Mya Stone came knocking on the door of his bedchamber, clad in boots and riding leathers and smelling strongly of the stable.""Mya had straw in her hair and a scowl on her face. That scowl comes of having Mychel Redfort near, Alayne knew."The character Alayne Stone is actually Sansa Stark living under the name Alayne.As yet, the book has no official publication date.* The fifth season of Game of Thrones debuts on HBO on April 12The author - who created the books that the hit HBO drama is created on - previously revealed that he won't write a script this year as he has traditionally done, so he can focus on writing the books."Writing a script takes me three weeks, minimum, and longer when it is not a straight adaptation from the novels," he said on his blog."And really, it would cost me more time than that, since I have never been good at changing gears from one medium to another and back again."Writing a season six script would cost me a month's work on Winds, and maybe as much as six weeks, and I cannot afford that."With David Benioff, DB Weiss, and Bryan Cogman on board, the scriptwriting chores for season six should be well covered."My energies are best devoted to Winds."Martin recently revealed that he is in favour of a big screen adaptation of the novels.* Season five of Game of Thrones begins on Sky Atlantic on April 13
A paedophile and career criminal has been jailed for 13 and a half years after sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl.Twisted Raymond Handley, 62, carried out two indecent assaults on his young victim before subjecting her to a sexual assault.It took years for his brave victim to report him to the police.Handley, of Bristol Road South, Rednal, was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court by Judge Roderick Henderson.He said: “You made threats and lied that she would not be believed, that everyone would think she was a liar. She was extremely young and can be described as suffering severe psychological harm from what you had done.”Handley denied his crimes but was convicted earlier this year by a jury at the same court.Niall Skinner, defending, said his client maintained the offences had not happened and said while he had over 90 previous convictions, none were for sex offences. “He is no stranger to prison because of his criminal record. He is in a bit of a different arena now and he is fearful for the future,” Mr Skinner said.Handley was jailed for 13-and-a-half years for the sexual assault and five years and seven years, to run concurrent, for the two indecent assaults.He was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for the rest of his life.
Redbird may be the most anticipated Los Angeles restaurant of the current decade, a venture involving the city's highest-profile food entrepreneur at the moment, an actual deconsecrated cathedral and a chef for whom greatness has lain just out of reach for more than a decade. No local restaurant has ever taken quite so long to open; no spit-grilled lamb belly with kumquats and Aleppo pepper has ever taken quite so long to reach the plate.How long? In the time elapsed between the announcement of the restaurant and the opening last December, Redbird's corner of downtown gentrified from gamy slum to shiny urban showcase — that fragrance on Main Street now is probably night-blooming jasmine, and the neighborhood is no longer inhospitable to gemelli pasta with rapini and braised goat. Neal Fraser, whose former restaurant Grace was considered among the city's couple dozen best, still had his casual restaurant BLD and a hot dog stand in the Original Farmers Market, but his detailed, locavore neo-French cooking was unknown to an entire generation of diners.Even the former St. Vibiana's had become better known as a high-rent event space than as the former center of Roman Catholicism in Southern California. Cardinals had lived there! (Thus Redbird's name.) The massive door behind the host stand had been donated to St. Vibiana's by a pope. But if you were on the festival circuit in the last few years, Vibiana's was where you went for fancy pancake breakfasts, hog roasts, beefsteak dinners and celebrations of Mexican cuisine. It was not a good idea in those years to ask Fraser or his wife, Amy Knoll Fraser, about the restaurant, which, as the movie guys say, was caught in development hell.But here we are, walking up the steps to the former rectory, passing through a softly glowing cocktail lounge and into a former patio, newly crowned with a retractable roof. From some angles, you can see bits of the former cathedral interior through the big glass windows — at night, the changing colored lights give the nave the look of a James Turrell installation. A locomotive-size grill chugs at one end of the dining room. The former apartments of the rectory, recently converted into private dining areas, soar overhead. And more than at any Los Angeles restaurant since Rex or the first decade of Campanile, you feel as if you are part of something bigger than yourself, a hungry, chattering component of a grand pleasure machine — even before the 32-ounce porterhouse shows up.And while the cooking isn't quite a throwback to the big California restaurants of the 1980s and 1990s, it does kind of look back to those times. When you sit down, you are greeted with what the waiters call an "amuse booze,'' a tiny, bitters-infused aperitif that recalls the Road Kill shots Fred Eric used to serve at his old Vida. The Dungeness crab soup, flavored to recall the chicken-coconut soup tom kha kai, is the kind of thing you might have seen at the mid-'90s restaurant Boxer, where you also might have seen a young Fraser on the line in his CIA baseball cap. Fraser likes smoke, chiles and farmers market vegetables; lingering tartness and mild funkiness; odd cross-cultural flavors like sumac, lemon grass and yuzu kosho; little crunchy things and lots of salt. If you accompanied him to a Japanese izakaya, you would probably let him order.His menu includes reminiscences of the tapas era (grilled spice-rubbed octopus tentacles with fava beans), the Yotam Ottolenghi fixation (that grilled lamb belly with spiced yogurt), modernist gastronomy (uni with chewy half-dried shrimp and a mystifying wasabi snow), farmers market obsession (tiny gnochetti pasta with nettles, lobster and luscious tomato confit) and the urban rustic Italian thing (fennel-scented "rabbitchetta'' with polenta and pea tendrils). As might be expected from a Cochon 555 winner, Fraser takes a swing at Big Pig, and his pink, juicy rack of heritage red wattle pork is delicious, served on a jumble of hazelnuts, chewy spaetzle, artichokes and a blood-fortified Calvados reduction that kind of out-Portlands everything in Oregon.So you bolster yourself with a truly good cocktail (Julian Cox, ubiquitous at Bill Chait restaurants, designed the list around favorites from century-old cocktail manuals), perhaps gin with ruddy house-made tonic or an embittered sake infusion called Little Tokyo. You choose a modestly priced Romorantin or a Jurassic Poulsard from the eclectic, well-chosen wine list. And you order — kind of small sharing plates, yet kind of not, in that pleasantly confusing jumble that has become more or less standard.There are roasted shishito peppers dusted with salty, shaved dried fish eggs; thick slabs of headcheese with figs on crisp slivers of toast; fried marbles of smoked pork shank glued to the plate with the Spanish pepper sauce romesco; and a vegetable "crudo,'' which is to say raw bits of asparagus, radish, greens and blossoms ballasted with a spring garlic purée.The thyme-scented chicken pot pie, served under a pastry dome in a little pot, is delicate and spring-like, slivers of dark meat simmered with vegetables and chewy nuggets of heart. Deep-flavored pozole is even better than you'd think it might be, thick, spicy and powered by hominy funk, garnished with tiny wisps of fried tortilla and a big hunk of gooey braised pork belly. (A bowl of Fraser's pozole and a shot of mezcal would make a perfect pre-clubbing snack.)Is Fraser's food occasionally forgettable? Of course. King salmon with beets is king salmon with beets, no matter how expertly cooked the fish, and it is easy to forget how dull a fish John Dory really is until you experience it with coins of actually tasty blood sausage. Soft, nutty slices of aged duck breast, a French technique starting to come back here, are overwhelmed by a slightly clumsy bed of Southern beans-and-rice hoppin' John — let me take that back: The clumsiness here actually works as an aesthetic.But the smoked tofu entrée is the surprise hit of the restaurant, as soft as the freshly made tofu in Korean soondubu parlors but as redolent of the pit as Texas brisket — I never in my life thought I'd find myself praising barbecued tofu. And if the chef is going to name something after himself, it may as well be Veal Fraser: a massive chop topped with braised veal cheeks, plopped on an intense red-wine demi-glace and served with a great mound of schmutz — the odd shredded bits of roast that Creole chefs call "debris'' — enhanced with chewy nubs of snail. It's an almost classical dish that presents all the layers of the food chain at once.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho refused to be drawn into the debate over Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's plans to boost home-grown players, insisting he is happy to do as he is told.Dyke wants to increase the minimum number of home-grown players in club squads from eight to 12, but he is facing opposition from the Premier League.The proposals also include changing the rules so that "home-grown" means having trained in England for three years before the age of 18 rather than before 21.Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger questioned the proposals on Thursday, but Mourinho said he will just adapt to whatever rules are put in place."I don't think. I just work with the rules that are presented to me. I have no power, my opinion is not important," Mourinho said."My opinion doesn't change the decision. The decision power is not in my hands. I just have to work with it."Only 36.8 per cent (81 out of 220) of Premier League starters in the last round of matches were eligible for England selection.It is figures like this that Dyke is keen to overhaul, but Wenger questioned whether quotas was the right way to go, saying: ''I believe we are in a top-level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth."One reason for Mourinho's more casual approach could be the fact Chelsea had 19 players on England youth duty during the international break, which was more than any other club.Given those statistics Chelsea would appear to be well placed if and when these further restrictions are imposed."In this moment I need to work with eight English players in my squad and I do that. If one day somebody tells me it's 10 or 12 or five or four, I adapt to the rules," Mourinho added."It's a bit like Financial Fair Play. I don't have to agree or disagree. I just have to work with the rules."West Brom boss Tony Pulis was more inclined to agree with Wenger, stressing places should be handed out on merit alone."If they're not good enough they shouldn't be in the squad. That's my argument," he said."If you're talking about stopping top foreign players coming into the country, that's not the way."Bringing the top players to play and work with the top players in England should aspire them to become better players themselves."Sunderland boss Dick Advocaat agreed with the idea in principle but admitted to being somewhat confused by the situation, given the number of quality English players already doing well in the Premier League."I was wondering when I saw that. It's a good idea, but how many good young players has England at the moment? A lot, in my opinion, and they are all playing in the first team - Sterling, Kane, Barkley, I can go on," he said."I don't know where the complaint is because they have still an excellent side."
Winnipeg Jets coach Paul Maurice said today he had no argument with the four-game suspension the NHL handed to defenceman Dustin Byfuglien on Thursday.Maurice did have a few issues with the other decisions and the "outrage" crowd over some of the criticism Byfuglien has absorbed for his cross-check in Tuesday’s game against the Rangers, including with Rangers coach Alain Vigneault's reaction.Byfuglien will not be eligible to return until April 11 against Calgary. His suspension begins with Saturday’s game here against Vancouver."I know the person," Maurice said today. "I know the man. The event, it wasn’t a retaliatory thing. At the end of the day, we are responsible for our own actions and it was a cross-check and it was a dangerous one. I have no problem with the suspension. I’ve said that here and even before I got here (that) I have no problem with any of the suspensions that happen in the league. And that’s true of Evander Kane and Adam Lowry’s suspension earlier."The rub is that we will always disagree with the weight of those suspensions."Is it two? Is it four? Is it 10? I have no problem with what the league decides on that. Where I’m going to disagree at times is which hit is worse. Is the (Antoine) Roussel hit (Feb. 12 to Adam McQuaid’s face) worse than that?"I don’t have to make those decisions. It’s a tough job. I’ve seen two hits from behind that in my mind are worse than the two that our guys got suspended for. But that’s my job. I’m going to protect my guys and always see them in the best possible light."I mean, Alain Vigneault wanted the electric chair. And I’ve got a lot more time for Dustin than that. So we will always be a little agitated by what we feel is the unfairness of it. From my point of view though, I think you can hand out heavier suspensions on all these events and the players will make the adjustment. The tough part is being consistent with it. And it is tough. It’s not an easy thing to get right. So we take the four games and we did something we shouldn’t do and we pay the price and move on."
These incredible pictures reveal how the entire front wall of a bank was blown off by thieves who stole the cash machine.The raid saw the front facade of Lloyds bank in Shirehampton, Bristol, blasted across the pavement and road at around 2am on Friday morning.A witness described seeing a gang of seven or eight men wearing black balaclavas swarm into the building before making off with cash.The man, who was working nearby and asked to remain anonymous, said: “I heard this loud bang which was louder than a firework."There was a lot of vibration and smoke.Explosion: Police are investigating a raid on an ATM cash machine at Lloyds Bank in Shirehampton“I rushed out and saw about seven or eight men with black balaclavas, black coats - they were all in black. One of them had a crowbar.“The cash point was blown into the middle of the road and they were taking black boxes out of it.“They left the scene in two cars. Everything was over in less than a minute.”A car was later stopped by police and a 19-year-old man was arrested and remained in custody on Friday afternoon.A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said: “Our inquiries are continuing and we’re appealing to anyone who might have been in the area at the time of the incident who may have seen suspicious activity or have information to help our inquiries.“If you can help, contact Bristol CID on the force number 101, quoting log number 87 of 03.04.2015.”
Air Canada is giving $5,000 to each passenger from the plane that crash landed at the Halifax airport last weekend."These are funds to cover immediate and interim expenses," Air Canada spokesman Angela Mah told QMI Agency in an e-mail Thursday evening."Our focus is on providing passengers and their families with assistance and we will continue to deal directly with these customers on any matters relating to additional claims."The $5,000 payout does not replace money that could be awarded in potential lawsuits, according to the airline."Contrary to statements by third parties, there is no requirement for our customers to sign any commitment," Mah wrote.Air Canada Flight AC624 from Toronto hit an antenna while landing at Stanfield International Airport in Halifax early Sunday morning. The plane's landing gear tore off, causing the plane to skid on its belly for hundreds of metres before coming to a stop.Twenty-five passengers of the 138 people on board were taken to hospital with injuries.A power line was cut during the landing, knocking out power to the airport.The jet was hauled away from the tarmac early Wednesday, according to an airport spokesman.The Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
A legal practitioner, Ezeukwu Innocent, has appealed to the federal government and its agencies, including the Ministry of Environment and Ministry of Niger Delta Affairs as well as the Senate and House of Representatives Committees on Environment to wade into an alleged case of oil spill between his client, the Umu-ozoma family in Ndokwa East local government of Delta State and Sterling Oil Exploration and Energy Production Company (SEEPCO).He also called on the Ministry of Petroleum to review and inspect the operation site of SEEPCO, with a view to bringing it to the standard regulation of environment, alleging that there are more than four pollution sites within SEEPCO’s operation site.Ezeukwu, a practitioner at Diligent Practice, a registered law firm, said the appeal became necessary, following the lingering of the case despite several efforts made to resolve the matter.Addressing a press conference in Abuja, he recalled that the spill, allegedly caused by the activities of SEEPCO, occurred at Umu-ozoma sub-family in Enesue, Okpai-Oluchi Kingdom in Ndokwa East on December 17, 2009.
A non-governmental organisation, Africa Youth Growth Foundation, has kicked off its 2015 scholarship award for secondary, undergraduate and post graduate students.The group whose aim is to provide quality education to 5000 indigent Nigerian students at home and abroad stated that the programme motivates students to be devoted to their studies, in the knowledge that their education is secure to a certain level.This is in view of the recent dwindling education standard of the country as seen in the students’ poor performances in WAEC and NECO examinations.Winners will be awarded within two categories; the internal and the external academic marathon. The internal academic marathon provides for students participating in the WAEC and NECO examinations while the external academic marathon provides similar (N5million scholarship funds), to undergraduate and postgraduate students to study in any part of the world. Students may have to sit for an examination where the winners will be awarded the scholarship.Beneficiaries of the scholarship last year were first place winner, Aka Tochukwu Victory, second place, Eze Ebube Benjamin, and third place winners, Iruke Kingsley and Obasi Emeka.
The key social media messages were shared before the Leaders Debate had even finished.During the first TV general election debate on ITV and afterwards, each of the seven parties used carefully crafted online tactics to convince people that their narrative of the debate was the "correct" version.After all, the seven UK political parties whose leaders participated know that many of those who didn't watch - and indeed many of those who did - will surf their social media timelines to get a first take on how it went.Each party created a version of events for their supporters to share with their friends and family. But the tactics each party used were very different from each other.The Labour party were the first political party to upload a clip from the live programme onto Facebook, turning around Ed Miliband's opening remarks five minutes after they were broadcast. They then kept uploading Milliband's statements - "Ed Miliband explains how Labour will put controls on immigration," for example, rapidly got 20,000 views.During the debate Shadow Justice Minister Sadiq Khan answered questions from Facebook users, answering such important queries as "Does David Cameron have a moon face?" and "where did you get that lovely jumper?" (TK Maxx, it turned out).There were also attack memes about David Cameron being created in Labour's social media timelines - for example one which picked up on a brief remark about zero-hours contracts.Since the Labour campaign team knew what their leader was going to say in his opening remarks they were able to intercut them with a much more highly produced video which was uploaded to social platforms eight minutes after the debate programme ended. This video was previewed with the line "Britain succeeds when working people succeed".Despite the fact that they have the most likes on Facebook, the Conservatives did not upload any content to the site during the debate. Instead they appeared to have crafted their messages several hours before the programme went on air.They shared six key messages on Facebook and Twitter before the debate, which included attacks on Labour, the Liberal Democrats and UKIP. For example, they re-used an old message about Ed Miliband being "in the SNP leader's pocket" to stress to undecided voters that given what some polls have predicted, Ed Miliband may need SNP votes to pass key legislation if he formed a government.They created a new version of the image to be shared, featuring new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon rather than Alex Salmond - though it was a an interesting reflection on her performance that memes of the poster, but with Sturgeon's pocket full of Nick Clegg, David Cameron and Ed Miliband, started trending after the debate.During the debate, supporters and activists stuck to the six key attack messages on social platforms and the party was remarkably quiet on Facebook. But immediately after the debate finished, the Conservatives rolled out a series of online videos under the hashtag #cameronincharge to press home their main message. This tag was used around 1,400 times in the first hour after the programme. The videos contrasted the "chaos" of other party leaders arguing amongst themselves, and the "competence" demonstrated by David Cameron while he answered questions from the audience. "This election is between the competence of a Conservative government or the chaos of Ed Miliband propped up by the SNP," the party later posted on Facebook.In contrast to the other political parties, the Liberal Democrats were much more focused on re-tweeting comments from activists, political people and the public. Rather than offering their own pre-made interpretation on the discussion, they hosted a live stream on their website, and used Twitter to supplement comments made by Nick Clegg during the programme. For example when Nick Clegg pushed the Conservatives on their plans for the NHS, viewers of the Liberal Democrat live stream were given the option to click on links which outlined the party's NHS policy.That's not to say they didn't engage in attack campaigning. They used Twitter to promote perceived weaknesses in Labour's position on zero hours contracts, by creating a meme which claimed that 68 former Labour MPs including the Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls had hired people on zero hours contracts.His hand gestures during the debate had been ridiculed by other Twitter users, but the party moved in on the joke by sharing an ITV News clip of Farage telling Leanne Wood and Nick Clegg "to please be sensible". The aim seemed to be to reinforce Nigel Farage's opening statement that he was "different from the political establishment".But it was his comments on the costs to the NHS of treating non-British nationals with HIV that caused the most controversy online. "There are 7,000 diagnoses in this country every year for people who are HIV positive," he said. "Which is not a good place for any of them to be, I know. But 60% of them are not British nationals".Criticism of the remarks by Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, who accused him of "scaremongering," got traction online during the debate. Other leaders were quick to criticise Mr Farage on Twitter after the debate ended - perhaps aware by then that the comments were the most tweeted-about moment in the debate (according to Twitter data). Nick Clegg tweeted that the comments were "simply vile and desperate. Politics in the lowest form". Ed Miliband tweeted: "Nigel Farage's comment about the NHS and HIV was disgusting. He should be ashamed". Mr Farage's official Twitter and Facebook accounts did not engage in the furore after the debate. Young UKIP supporters continued to promote their own political party memes under #TeamNigel, but the party went back to releasing more traditional style campaign posters on its Facebook page.SNP supporters online seemed slightly sidetracked at the beginning of the debate, as they engaged in an energetic discussion about a post from the British National Party (former party leader Nick Griffin had shared an image of people from minorities wearing kilts to criticise SNP refugee policy).Like Labour, the SNP were quick to turn around videos for social platforms during the debate. The party's Facebook page filled with clips from the programme which emphasized Nicola Sturgeon fighting for Scotland. They were labelled with quotes from Ms Sturgeon such as "we've seen tonight why we need to break the old boys' network at Westminster".In the run-up to the debate key figures within the SNP like Angus Robertson had featured in "video diary" style clips which urged supporters to engage in the political discussion online. These videos have formed a key party of the party's political strategy since the independence referendum, and often have a "behind the scenes" feel. Immediately after the debate, Nicola Sturgeon recorded a video diary thanking supporters for sending her direct messages and reminding them of her "alternative message on austerity".Green Party: "no to politics as usual"The debate was seemingly a social media success for the Greens: the fourth most popular link shared on Twitter during the debate seems to be the Green Party's campaign website (the others were news reports). This is especially striking as the Greens were the only party not to upload a significant volume of Leader Debates specific content onto their Facebook page in the hours leading up to the debate, although during the debate they posted campaign posters which highlighted the achievement of their first green MP Caroline Lucas.One of the funnier aspects of the wider discussion on social media was that many people appeared to have not realised that the Greens' leader Natalie Bennett is Australian until today. One said: "#greenparty And Australian?? Don't we have some kind of heritage requirements??".The Welsh Nationalist Party took a pop art approach to their social media campaign during the debate, posting treated images of Leanne Wood and cartoon drawings of bankers.The party also celebrated her apparently positive reception by the studio audience. They released a six second vine video of the applause after Leanne Wood accused Nigel Farage of "dangerous scaremongering".Next story: The faces of prostitution in AustraliaYou can follow BBC Trending on Twitter @BBCtrending, and find us on Facebook.

There was no clear winner in the only TV debate pitting seven political leaders against one another ahead of the May 7 British general election.Ed Miliband topped one poll, the Scottish National Party's Nicola Sturgeon another and the Labour leader tied with Primer Minister David Cameron and Ukip leader Nigel Farage in first place in a third.After the prime minister refused to face Mr Miliband in a head-to-head televised debate, the ITV showdown was the only chance for the two men to confront one another on key election issues like the economy, jobs, immigration and health.Mr Cameron accused the Labour leader of planning more debt, taxes, borrowing and spending and urged voters to let Conservatives complete their "long-term economic plan", telling them: "What my plan is about is basically one word - security. Security for you, for your family, for our country."In a clear effort to bolster his credentials as an alternative premier, Mr Miliband repeatedly described what he would do "if I am prime minister". He accused Mr Cameron of wanting to talk about the past rather than the future, and said: "Some people will tell you that this is as good as it gets for Britain. I say Britain can do so much better than it has done over the last five years."Mr Farage accused the other leaders of being "all the same" and said he was the only one who wanted to control immigration by pulling Britain out of the European Union.But he clashed with Plaid Cymru's Leanne Wood, who accused him of "scaremongering" and said he should be ashamed of himself after he raised the issue of foreign nationals receiving HIV treatment on the NHS and said: "We've got to put our own people first".Nick Clegg sought to distance the Liberal Democrats from the two biggest parties, directly taking on Mr Cameron over what he termed "ideologically-driven cuts" and challenging Mr Miliband to use the opportunity presented by the debate to apologise publicly for "crashing the economy" as part of the last Labour administration.At one point, Mr Cameron was interrupted by a heckler from the 200-strong studio audience, Victoria Prosser, who demanded to be heard as she protested at the treatment of military veterans, shouting: "There's more of us than there is of them and they are not listening to us."Explaining her intervention, she said: "David Cameron mentioned giving a fair deal to everybody in this country, including people such as our fine military service people. Yes, they are fine. But they are not treated fine after they have left the army, when they are in poverty and destitution, homeless on the streets and no hope of getting housed. He is using their name just to garner votes, because it might be a vote winner."Mr Farage claimed an early advantage, with 24pc of viewers polled at the halfway point by ComRes for ITV News rating him the best performer, ahead of Mr Miliband on 21pc and Mr Cameron on 19pc. But by the end, the picture was less clear, with Mr Miliband leading an ICM poll in 'The Guardian', taking 25pc of support, just ahead of Mr Cameron on 24pc, with Mr Farage on 19pc.A ComRes post-debate poll had Mr Miliband, Mr Cameron and Mr Farage tied in first place on 21pc, with Ms Sturgeon on 20pc. And a YouGov poll had the SNP leader top with 28pc backing, followed by Mr Farage (20pc), Mr Cameron (18pc) and Mr Miliband (15pc).Mr Cameron enjoyed a strong lead in a key section of the ComRes poll, rated most capable of leading the country by 40pc of the 1,120 viewers taking part, well ahead of Mr Miliband on 28pc.Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband clashed on the economy, with the prime minister saying the Labour leader "still thinks the last Labour government didn't tax too much, borrow too much and spend too much".He added: "And if you don't understand the mistakes of the past, you can't provide the leadership of the future."A Miliband administration would "go into your monthly payslip and take your money out" in taxes, he warned.Mr Miliband insisted that Labour would cut the deficit every year and balance the books, but "do it in a fairer and a better way than has been tried for the last five years", increasing the minimum wage to £8 and banning exploitative zero-hours contracts.
Andreas Lubitz, the rogue pilot who brought down a plane in the French Alps last week, lied to doctors by telling them he was on sick leave when he was still flying commercial airliners, according to German reports.The 27-year-old who locked his captain out of their Germanwings Airbus A320 cockpit and slammed the plane into the Alps last Tuesday, killing 150, was on medication so strong that patients are advised not to drive a car, let alone fly a commercial plane, according to Bild, the German daily.Side effects also include an increased risk of suicide.Lubitz had sought medical attention to try and cure an eye condition, the paper reported.Although he gave doctors information about his job as a pilot, and in some cases about his employer, he deliberately hid the fact that he was still working, Bild said, citing sources close to the investigation.Documents also reportedly revealed that Lubitz recounted being involved in a car crash at the end of 2014 in which he suffered injuries when his airbag opened.Since the accident, he had complained of trauma and impaired hearing and vision."He stated during medical treatment that, among other things, it often appeared dark around him," wrote Bild.He underwent an MRI scan on his brain but no significant damage was found.According to medical records, Lubitz stated that he was taking medicines to treat depression, anxiety disorders and panic attacks, the paper said, adding the drugs were an antidepressant and the tranquilliser Lorazepam.Medical experts say it can also increase the risk of self-harm at the start of treatment.The report came a day after Germanwings parent company Lufthansa confirmed that when Lubitz resumed pilot training in 2009 he provided the flight school with medical documents showing he had gone through a "previous episode of severe depression".He was apparently more stable in recent years, but in the last few weeks had reportedly seen doctors three times for depression and an eye doctor over fears he was losing his sight.

A spokesman for al-Shabaab last night said that the group carried out the attack."We've killed many people. Kenyans will be shocked when they go inside," he was quoted by the BBC as saying.Witnesses told how they released Muslim students and shot Christians.One student who witnessed the attack said he could hear militants opening doors and asking those hiding inside if they were Muslim or Christian."If you were a Christian, you were shot on the spot," he said."With each blast of the gun, I thought I was going to die." In a speech to the nation President Kenyatta Uhuru confirmed the slaughter: "I am saddened to inform the nation that, early today, terrorists attacked Garissa University College, killed and wounded several people and have taken others hostage."A policeman at the scene earlier said he had counted 14 bodies being carried out of the campus by a Red Cross Ambulance. "They include two of our officers who were also killed," he said."We are finding it difficult to access the compound because some of the attackers are on top of a building and are firing at us whenever we try to enter."One student who fled described chaotic scenes as gunmen burst into the building. "They are just shooting randomly," he said."My life was in danger, in fact everybody's. They were shooting at us with live bullets, everywhere, all over the school compound."I am trying to call [students still trapped inside] but I can't reach anyone." Two of the fatalities were guards at the university gates.The US Embassy in Nairobi condemned the shooting as a "terrorist attack" on its official Twitter feed.
China's former security tsar Zhou Yongkang has been formally charged with corruption, abuse of power and intentionally leaking state secrets by prosecutors in Tianjin, the People’s Daily reported on Friday morning.Zhou was placed under investigation for alleged abuse of power and corruption in late 2013.State media reported in December that Zhou would face criminal charges after he was expelled from the Communist Party.The Supreme People's Court's annual work report released last month said Zhou had "undermined the party's solidarity and engaged in political activities".
The United States Senate Committees on Judiciary and Foreign Relations, the Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs, Secretary John Kerry together with Nigerians in the Diaspora Organisation in the Americas (NIDOA) yesterday congratulated the president-elect, General Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) and President Goodluck Jonathan for the successful presidential election held last Saturday.Speaking in a statement made available to our correspondent, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Chris Coons, said that the election was an important step for Nigeria’s democracy and future. “Nigeria still faces considerable challenges; so it is critical that all parties commit to a peaceful transition of power and recognise the importance of a government with broad democratic legitimacy. I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Obama Administration to help President-elect Buhari combat Boko Haram and build a more secure and prosperous country for all Nigerians”, he said.In its own statement signed by its chairman, Senator Robert Menendez, US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations applauded the Nigerian people and political leaders on both sides for their commitment and dedication to the democratic process.Commending INEC and its chairman, Prof Attahiru Jega, for the work it has done in administering the elections, the committee said it hoped that the Governorship and State Assembly elections on April 11 would proceed in the same peaceful and orderly manner. “I look forward to continued cooperation between our countries on development, trade and security matters”, Menendez said.Also, chairman of the US Congress Committee on Foreign Affairs, Rep. Ed Royce (R-CA), lauded the Nigerian people for turning out in their millions to exercise their civic rights regardless of Boko Haram’s threats to disrupt the elections.“Now, voters must respect the outcome. Disputes should be handled in the courtroom, not in the streets. President Goodluck Jonathan demonstrated true leadership in conceding to Mr Buhari. President Jonathan must now ensure that his loyalists follow his lead and step away from power peacefully, forever distinguishing himself and this transition in Nigeria’s history. President-elect Buhari made some bold commitments during his campaign, including to root out Nigeria’s rampant corruption. He should stay true to his political pledges. The committee stands ready to work with President-elect Buhari in tackling the number of security and economic challenges facing Nigeria, particularly combating Boko Haram”, Royce further said.Meanwhile, the United States secretary, Senator John Kerry, has congratulated the people of Nigeria and the Nigerian government on the historic and largely peaceful elections that took place on March 28.
The Delta State chapter of the Accord Party has vowed to contest the result of the Delta North senatorial election, saying the Peoples Democratic Party stole their victory at the polls by manipulating the results.The Chairman of the Accord Party in the state, David Ashikodi, told our correspondent that they have proof that the election results in Delta North were manipulated in favour the PDP to rig out their party’s candidate, Chief Victor Ochei, who was coasting to victory.According to the result announced by the Independent National Electoral Commission, Ochei came second behind the PDP’s candidate, Peter Nwaoboshi.Ashikodi said, “The PDP was desperate to win the election at all cost. Due democratic process was not followed there were so many anomalies that were anti-democracy. We, as a party, are thinking of contesting the result as announced by INEC. For example, one of the electoral officers that came to present results said there were 20 political parties that contested the senatorial seat in Delta North, whereas there were only 12.“It was the electoral officer of Aniocha South. He said there were 20 political parties that contested the election and votes were allotted to all the 20 parties. When he raised the issue, the returning officer saw my reason and asked him to go and tidy up his document.The Publicity Secretary of Delta PDP, Macaulay Deghan, refuted Ashikodi’s claim, saying there was no way an Accord candidate could defeat a PDP candidate in a PDP state, like Delta.He said, “Those are unfounded stories. It is a very clear fact that they were not on ground and they are claiming we manipulated the election result. I don’t know where they want to get the human beings to vote for them. Does Accord have a structure in Delta North? Do you manufacture supporters overnight?”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

A second teenager has been charged over a wild brawl in Northbridge last month that left a restaurant manager and an elderly man injured.About 8pm on March 28, three males left Outback Jacks restaurant in an allegedly disorderly way.Police say one of the men, a 24-year-old from Beechboro, pulled out a knife as the group harassed customers.The males allegedly threw chairs and tables from the al fresco area of the James Street venue at diners.An Outback Jacks manager tried to stop them going inside but was allegedly pushed over and punched.It is alleged the manager fell and was kicked by one of the men.A 45-year-old customer was injured when the 24-year-old allegedly threw a chair at her head.The trio ran towards William Street as the man allegedly threw chairs and poles at people.He allegedly threw a bottle at a family and punched a man aged 76 in the face at the Cultural Centre.Police said this morning that Perth Detectives had charged a 16-year-old Beechboro boy with going armed in public to cause fear and disorderly conduct.A 15-year-old Yokine boy has been charged with acts or omissions causing bodily harm or anger.He is due to appear in Perth Children’s Court on April 13.Earlier this week a 16-year-old Beechboro boy was charged with going armed in public to cause fear and disorderly conduct over the incident.He is also due to appear in Perth Children’s Court on April 13.A man has already appeared in Perth Magistrate’s Court this week after being charged with two counts each of common assault and endangering life, health or safety and one of aggravated assault.He was remanded in custody until April 7.Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China's securities regulator approved 30 initial public offerings (IPOs) late on Thursday, a move which could cool a stock market rally that has seen the benchmark blue-chip index surge 13 percent since the start of this year.The number of IPOs approved jumped from 20 in January, and 24 each in February and March, sending out the message that regulators intend to accelerate the pace of IPOs as part of their efforts to cool the red-hot market, analysts said.Twenty-eight among the 30 on Friday published their share issue prospectuses to launch the IPOs over the next two weeks, based on filings to the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.Chinese investors typically show strong interest in new share issues and subscriptions to IPOs typically lock up huge amounts of cash for a few days and divert funds from existing shares, cooling the secondary market.The official Chinese Securities Journal estimated on Friday that the latest batch of IPOs could tie up as much as 3.7 trillion yuan (402 billion pounds) in subscription funds for a short period over the next two weeks.China's blue-chip CSI300 index has surged since the second half of last year as the government talks up the market to support corporate fund-raising, while economic reforms add to enthusiasm for hot stocks.The official Securities Times reported on Friday that around one trillion yuan of fresh funds flowed into the stock market in the first quarter of this year alone.
About $15,000 worth of drugs have been seized at a Gold Coast building believed to be a Hells Angels clubhouse.Detectives say the premises at Burleigh Heads, disguised as a business, had a bar, entertainment equipment and paraphernalia of the outlaw bikie gang.Police also allegedly found 21g of methamphetamine, 102 ecstasy tablets and a small quantity of cocaine worth about $15,000.Steroids were found at a second premises, also searched on Thursday night, at Mermaid Beach.A 41-year-old man, an alleged member of the Hells Angels' Gold Coast chapter, was arrested and charged with four counts of possession of a dangerous drug.He is due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday.A second man, 24, also accused of being a Hells Angels member, was issued with a notice to appear for two counts of unlicensed driving.
A frail elderly man was preparing to spend what would undoubtedly be a long night in hospital.His worried loved ones towered over him with concerned faces and one woman planted a kiss on his forehead as she tucked a thin blue blanket around him. The small group around this patient were tending to him before they would unwillingly leave his side, their faces full of emotion as they placed his overnight bag at the end of his bed. The tender moment they shared with their loved one should have been for their eyes only. Instead, the family were stripped of their modesty in this trying time, because their beloved was lying on a bed which was parked against the nurses' station in the A&E department in St Vincent's Hospital, shortly after 10pm on a damp evening earlier this week.There was not even a flimsy curtain to give this family some privacy, denying them of a few quiet moments.Around them, machines were whirring, intermittently beeping and bleeping loudly. Anxious doctors and nurses with kind faces quickly moved back and forth to tend to patients who were calling for help.Patients lay on trolleys all around the main area, as all of the curtained bays seemed to be occupied. A cleaner tried to manoeuvre his way around a trolley and the woman lying on it called out to him, as she appeared to be looking for a nurse.And, just when I thought I had seen it all, I spotted a dark corridor leading off from the main area which was lined with up to four more patients who were lying on beds and trolleys.As I wandered down it, I spotted an elderly man - in his 70s at least - speaking in hushed tones to his wife, who was loyally perched by his side in an uncomfortable-looking wooden chair.She was not the only one, and many others seemed resolved to spending the rest of the night in these chairs. Some of these seemed to be patients with hospital bands strapped around their wrists, and one man appeared to be sitting beside a sink.Despite these patients being stripped of their dignity as they lay hoping their lengthy wait would soon come to an end, they were actually the lucky ones. On the other side of the divide, almost 50 people were wearily standing and sitting in the waiting room, praying for someone in scrubs to enter and call their name to bring them through.One frail, pale woman sat in a hospital gown clutching the hand of a friend as she waited, while another man appeared to be dabbing blood from an oozing facial wound.
I am writing this letter to connect with the hearts of Irish people. There is still prejudice towards gay people in Ireland - and we need to change this. We can do this by going out and voting for marriage equality on May 22. I have a son and a daughter, both of whom I am very proud of. My son Daragh is gay and is in a civil partnership. I will be voting 'Yes' in the forthcoming marriage equality referendum.By voting 'Yes', we are giving the message to young gay people that it's OK to be yourself. I am voting 'Yes' because I wish my son - and other gay and lesbian couples - to have the same rights under the law as everyone else. That is, the right to marry the person they love.I am writing a letter to a paper for the first time in my life. I am a rather passive person, but sometimes we must make a stand. And one thing that will make us stand up is when we see our children being put down or being discriminated against. To quote Rosa Parks "we must stand up for something or we will fall for everything".I am asking everyone to come out and vote - mothers, fathers, grandparents, brothers, sisters cousins and friends. There may be someone in your family that is gay and is afraid to share this. This is very sad and often leaves that person feeling isolated and rejected.By voting 'Yes', we are affirming the right of every person to live true to themselves in an open and caring community, that celebrates the preciousness and uniqueness of each individual.Not that long ago people in Ireland had to hide the fact that they were gay. It is now 2015 and it is sad to think that some people are afraid to express themselves and have to live a lie. Young men are bullied in schools and there are a lot of young people suffering from depression, which sometimes leads to suicide. A 'Yes' vote will change people's attitudes. Young people will see that it is OK to be gay and that society accepts them.I often say to mothers of gay men who are finding it difficult to support their child that as mothers we have one major role in life - and that is to love our children unconditionally.Banks are not known for their scruples. They have proved this by continually singling out variable rate mortgage customers for interest rate hikes. They are effectively making these customers pay for their banks' own myopic decisions to introduce tracker rate mortgages during the property boom. Empathy towards customers finding it difficult to make ends meet does not come into the equation.Taoiseach Enda Kenny asked the banks to show "a degree of understanding", while Finance Minister Michael Noonan will "discuss the matter with the governor of the Central Bank".If we look beyond this posturing, it is obvious that the Government has no real desire to see banks reduce their interest rates. The more money these banks extract from their customers, the more valuable the State's shares become, eventually leading to a greater windfall with any eventual sell-off. The banks and the Government are like two peas in a pod.The Government keeps coming out and saying it does not have the power to reduce variable rate mortgages. Well, pass a law to get the power.They were very quick to penalise the people of Ireland with every cut they could muster just to prop up these banks, now it's time they stepped up to the mark.Your paper can do its bit by keeping this on the front page until something is done by Michael Noonan and Co.Tim Pat Coogan writes that "the British Officer Corps in Ireland let it be known that they would not take part in any armed attempt to enforce Home Rule on Ulster" ('A little of the idealism of 1916 would go a long way', April 2).Mr Coogan should be aware that in the so-called Curragh Incident of March 1914 it was only the officers of the Cavalry Brigade who indicated that they would rather resign their commissions that take part in any coercive operations; the officers of the much larger Infantry Division stationed at the Curragh were persuaded by Major-General Sir Charles Fergusson not to take similar action.Almost every second house seems to have a 'No Junk Mail' sign on their letterbox. Do people not realise that this so-called 'junk mail' creates many jobs?I have family members in the printing business who have lost their jobs - delivery people, post men and women the same. It is also a means of advertising for small businesspeople.If you don't want to read said items when they come through your letterbox, then put them in your green bin for recycling. More jobs are created as a result. Seriously, people, just think about it.I cannot believe there are people like Henry Hughes (April 2) who genuinely think the most pressing matter facing the management of An Post, or indeed the country, is replacing post boxes that have the initials of previous monarchs. Monarchs who, whether they like or not, were also the king or queen of Ireland.Mr Hughes also seems to be under the delusion that Antrim is part of the Republic of Ireland when he suggests its post boxes should be changed too. Whether he likes it or not Antrim is part of the United Kingdom. Until that changes, its post boxes should reflect that fact.I don't understand the basis upon which he thinks the post boxes of the North should be the same as those in the Republic of Ireland, given they are two different countries.It is also surprising when people from the North assume that those of us from the Republic want to be joined with them in the same country when there is no evidence that this is the case.We were part of the United Kingdom for hundreds of years and, Mr Hughes might not like to hear it, judging by how badly we have managed our own affairs over the past 100 years, it is reasonable to question if the lives of the Irish people would have been any different or better if things had remained as they were.If Mr Hughes's claim is that everything bad that ever happened in Ireland, like having red post boxes, is the fault of colonialism, then he is mistaken.
AN elderly farmer and a 16-year-old girl discovered in a 'distressed state' after a search were both airlifted to hospital yesterday in two separate incidents in Co Clare.The man, who is in his 80s, is understood to have sustained serious crush injuries after he was struck by a tractor on a farm in the west of the county.The alarm was raised at around 3.30pm and emergency services rushed to the scene between Rehy West and Kilbaha, on the Loop Head Peninsula.Ambulance paramedics located the pensioner who had sustained multiple serious injuries to his upper body and head.The National Aeromedical Coordination Centre contacted the Irish Coast Guard to ask if they could provide a helicopter to undertake the air ambulance mission.At the time, the Shannon-based search and rescue helicopter, Rescue 115, had been engaged in a search for the missing 16-year-old in the Cratloe Woods area.The helicopter was re-routed to lift the injured pensioner to University Hospital Limerick.Meanwhile, the search continued in Cratloe for the teenage girl, whose worried family had reported her missing at around 1.30pm yesterday after becoming concerned for her safety.Gardaí and the Killaloe unit of the Irish Coast Guard joined in the search.After several hours, gardaí located the girl in Cratloe Woods at around 6pm. She was said to have been cold, wet and in a "distressed state".She was taken to the GAA field in Cratloe where a decision was taken to call the search and rescue helicopter to airlift her to hospital for treatment.She was described as being in a 'stable' condition last night.
Three young Irish-born children abandoned by their parents in England are to be brought home and placed in care, the High Court was told.Ms Justice Carmel Stewart has made several orders and declarations which will result in the children, who have been cared for by English Social Services, being returned to Ireland.The judge said she was satisfied Ireland is the children's habitual residence. The three siblings, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, are all under five years of age.The application to repatriate the children was made by the Child and Family Agency (CFA), represented in court by barrister Felix McEnroy SC.Mr McEnroy yesterday said all parties involved with their care were in favour of repatriating the children who had been abandoned in a neighbouring jurisdiction and plans have been put in place by the CFA for their care.Mr McEnroy said that in 2013 the children had been taken by their parents to England. The children's father was involved in criminality in Ireland and had left for England arising out of a perceived threat to him and his wife. Counsel, who described the family's situation as chaotic, said the parents suffered from personal problems including substance abuse.He said the family initially returned to Ireland but the children had been brought back to England last year, where the three children came to the attention of social services after the family had become homeless, and due to the parents' substance abuse.In addition, Mr McEnroy said a scald mark had been discovered on one of the children which required hospital treatment.After the children had been put in care in England, their parents had returned to Ireland. Attempts to find the parents had proved difficult and they had not contacted the children for some months.The matter will come before the High Court again later this month.
New Democrat foreign affairs critic Paul Dewar levelled the characterization at the minister as he testified before the House of Commons foreign affairs committee.The angry words came after Dewar was unable to wrestle a commitment from Nicholson to use his discretion and issue a new passport. The minister reiterated what Fahmy was told in a letter this week from Canadian passport officials, that a new passport will only be issued when a court-imposed travel ban, which is part of his bail conditions, is lifted.The Canadian journalist is on trial in Egypt on widely denounced terror charges and says he is crippled by Ottawa’s refusal to issue him a new passport while he awaits the outcome of his case.The 40-year-old’s passport was seized by Egyptian authorities when he was first arrested in December 2013 and has never been returned.Dewar said Fahmy needs the document to get married and rent an apartment and car while awaiting trial in Egypt. Nicholson said the issue of a new passport was the bailiwick of Immigration Minister Chris Alexander.“Mr. Nicholson, you’re married, I’m married, you remember what it was like, you had to actually go to officials and provide documents. Why aren’t you allowing Mr. Fahmy to get married? Don’t give me this — it’s Mr. Alexander,” said Dewar.“Is that the standard of service that this government is giving to Canadians abroad? If it is, then you’re incompetent sir . . . it is a matter of incompetence and it’s disgraceful.”Nicholson did not reply, as Dewar’s seven minutes of allotted question time expired and the committee moved on.The minister left the hearing before he could be questioned by reporters.But Dewar expanded on his remarks once the meeting ended.“Either we’ve got a minister who doesn’t understand his job — and that’s incompetence — or they’re not actually willing to offer a passport to him, and that means they’re abandoning him as a Canadian citizen.”The Canadian Press caught up with Nicholson at the door of his limousine on Parliament Hill as he was departing for the day.“I know the consular officials are in touch with him and I’ve got complete confidence in them; they will continue to work with him and, again I’ve complete confidence in the work that my colleague Lynn Yelich has done as well,” Nicholson said.A spokesman for Immigration Chris Alexander did not respond to a request for comment.A spokeswoman for Yelich, the junior foreign minister for consular affairs, said in an email: “we have a travel document prepared for Mr. Fahmy once he is able to travel.”She said the passport law says the government “may refuse” a passport request if the applicant is “subject to a term of imprisonment outside Canada or is forbidden to leave a foreign state or the territorial jurisdiction of a foreign court by conditions.”Fahmy was working for satellite news broadcaster Al Jazeera English when was arrested in Cairo with two colleagues.Fahmy was sentenced to seven years in prison after a trial that was condemned internationally as unfair.A successful appeal resulted in a retrial and he spent more than a year in prison before being granted bail shortly after the retrial began.
TORONTO - Investigators now believe the house fire that claimed the life of 10-year-old Mark Mrochuk in Scarborough last weekend was caused by “unattended cooking.”The Office of the Fire Marshal and Emergency Management (OFMEM) was called in to probe the circumstances of the deadly blaze at a Toronto Community Housing Corporation townhouse complex in Scarborough, Ont. The fire erupted around 5:15 a.m. Saturday, trapping four siblings and their mom upstairs in their bedrooms.“The (OFMEM) is now confirming that the cause of the fatal fire that occurred ... was accidental, as a result of unattended cooking,” spokesman Carol Gravelle said in a statement released Friday.All four kids and their mom were rushed to hospital.The mother and one daughter suffered serious injuries. Another daughter and one son suffered minor injuries.A memorial at 4311 Kingston Rd in Toronto, On. on Monday March 30, 2015.

Al-Shabab gunmen have attacked a college campus in the town of Garissa in North east Kenya, shooting indiscriminately in dormitories and killing at least 147 people and wounding 65 others, police said.Witnesses said explosions and heavy gunfire rocked Garissa University College yesterday as the gunmen stormed the complex. Ambulances were seen driving injured students to local hospitals.The gunmen were holding an “unknown number of student hostages,” the Kenya Red Cross said in a statement.Some “150 students have been safely freed”, the organisation said. Terrified students streamed out of buildings, some young men shirtless, as arriving police officers hunkered down, taking cover, witnesses said.Witnesses reported hearing sporadic exchanges of fire between police and the fighters. At least two police had been wounded in the clashes, though the extent of their injuries in not known.The final death toll could be as high as 150, the Associated Press news agency reported, citing Kenyan officials.Security forces had encircled the building exchanging sporadic bursts of gunfire with the fighters inside, who were believed to have been holding scores of students hostage.Witnesses said that they heard heavy gunfire and saw smoke coming from the campus yesterday.“I think the military is using all its might to finish the hostage situation. I don’t think this is a rescue mission anymore,” said Alinoor Moulid, a freelance journalist based in Garissa.Surviving hostages said scores appeared to have been killed.A female student said there were more bodies than she could count, while another student said he had seen more than 100 bodies.Kenyan officials said four attackers had been killed and another had been arrested.Kenya’s President Uhuru Kenyatta said the lack of security infrastructure had contributed to the crisis.“We have suffered unnecessarily due to a shortage of security personnel. Kenya needs additional officers, and I will not keep the nation waiting,” he said.The country’s interior ministry announced a twelve hour curfew starting at 630pm in Garissa, Wajir, Mandera, and Tana River counties.Meanwhile, President Goolduck Jonathan yesterday condemned the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya the terrorist group Al-Shabab, describing it as atrocious, despicable and barbaric.A statement issued by presidential spokesman, Dr. Reuben Abati, noted that Jonathan extended his heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Kenya and to the families of those who died “in the gruesome terrorist attack”.He assured that country that Nigeria will continue to work with it, other African countries and the international community to rid the world of all terrorist groups.Abati stated: “President Jonathan utterly condemns the deliberate targeting of innocent persons, schools and other soft targets by terrorists as such atrocious, despicable and barbaric acts of violence ought to have no place in any civilized society.“The President assures President Uhuru Kenyatta and the brotherly people of Kenya that Nigeria stands in full solidarity with them as they come to grips once again with the aftermath of another heinous terrorist attack on their country.“The President believes that the attack on the Kenyan University and other similar atrocities across the world must strengthen and solidify the resolve of the global community to take more urgent and co-ordinated actions to speedily defeat the agents of global terror”.
SIGNATORIES of the 1916 Proclamation would "deeply regret and resent" the IRA sex abuse controversy that has engulfed the Sinn Féin party, Tánaiste Joan Burton has claimed.The Labour Party leader last night warned that Sinn Féin will look to "claim ownership" of next year's Easter Rising commemorations, adding that the term 'republicanism' does not belong to any one group.In comments that were last night attacked by Sinn Féin, Ms Burton pointed out that Gerry Adams's party did not even exist during the Rising.And Ms Burton said those who were in the GPO in 1916 would be disturbed by the recent controversies surrounding IRA sex abuse and kangaroo courts."There is a very narrow definition of republicanism which is used by Sinn Féin and others to mean those people who are part of what has become modern-day Sinn Féin," Ms Burton said in an interview with the Irish Independent."In many ways, I think many of the people who were in the GPO would deeply regret and resent some of the events that have become associated with them, as people seek to claim ownership," she added.Ms Burton said that while the foundation of the State was preceded by a "bloody and violent insurrection" next year's events would be based on the acknowledgement that the "necessity for violence has become redundant"."The republic that we've created means that we don't have to resort to violence again," she said.The Dublin West TD said that the meaning of republicanism would be devalued if attempts were made to claim ownership of the celebrations."If ownership of that were to be claimed by any one party, or grouping, republicanism would be much reduced or diminished by it. So we are all equally entitled to call ourselves a republican, we are all entitled to be inspired by the values set out in the Proclamation."Last night, Sinn Féin deputy leader Mary Lou McDonald hit out at Ms Burton over her remarks."Joan Burton's comments are utterly pathetic. It would suit her better to think of the principles upon which the Labour Party was founded and its involvement in the Rising, rather than taking cheap shots at Sinn Féin," she said in a statement to the Irish Independent."Those who were in the GPO in 1916 would turn in their graves at the actions of Joan Burton and the modern-day Labour Party," she added.The clash between the two politicians came just days after the Government announced details of its commemoration plans.No fewer than 40 major events have been announced for next year, with the centrepiece being a wreath-laying ceremony and parade in Dublin city centre.
Gold Coast police have raided an alleged Hells Angels club house, seizing $15,000 worth of drugs and charging two club members.Armed with a search warrant, detectives from the anti-bikie Taskforce Maxima raided the club house on Ern Harley Drive, Burleigh Heads, along with a property at Great Hall Drive, Mermaid Beach on Thursday night.Police will allege the Ern Harley Drive building, which was disguised as a business and contained a bar, entertainment facilities and Hells Angels paraphernalia, was the club house of the gang's Gold Coast chapter.Police allegedly discovered about 21 grams of methyl-amphetamines, commonly known by its street name "ice", 102 ecstasy tablets and a "small quantity" of cocaine, with a combined total street value of about $15,000.Steroids were allegedly found at the Mermaid Beach address.Two patched members of the Hells Angels' Gold Coast chapter were arrested as a result of the raids.A 41-year-old man was arrested and charged with four counts of possessing a dangerous drug, while a 24-year-old man was charged with two counts of unlicensed driving."Last night's efforts saw the location of what we are alleging to be dangerous drugs stored in the gang's club house," Taskforce Maxima Detective Inspector Brendan Smith said."They need to understand unlawful behaviour will not be tolerated and if they continue to offend we will be back."The links between 'ice' and violence and property crime are well known, as such and we will continue to target those involved in its manufacture, distribution and use."The 41-year-old was expected to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Saturday.
A US jury has awarded $US150 million ($A197.99 million) to the family of a four-year-old boy killed when a Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded into flames after being rear-ended three years ago.The Georgia jury said Chrysler, the maker of Jeeps, must pay nearly the full amount.Jurors in Decatur County on Thursday ruled that Chrysler acted with reckless disregard for human life in selling the family of Remington "Remi" Walden a 1999 Jeep with a gas tank mounted behind the rear axle.Walden, of Bainbridge, Georgia, was killed when the Jeep driven by his aunt was hit from behind by a pickup truck in March 2012. The fuel tank leaked, engulfing the Jeep in flames and killing the boy.The verdict comes nearly two years after Chrysler compromised with a federal safety agency and agreed to a scaled-down recall of some older-model Jeeps with the rear-mounted tanks. The tanks have little structure to protect them if struck from behind, making them susceptible to punctures and fires.Federal documents show that at least 75 people have died in post-crash fires due to the rear-mounted fuel tanks.

Managing Director of Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation, Mr Bode Opadokun  Ebere Nwoji The management of Nigeria Agricultural Insurance Corporation (NAIC)   has set for itself the  target  to  increase the number of insured farmers in Nigeria from the current two million as five million in this current year.The corporation  also  declared its determination to  continue to play the leadership role in the agricultural insurance and general insurance business  in Nigeria through a deep commitment of service excellence to its clientele.NAIC said to achieve this, it  intends to gain deeper insight into customer’s specific needs and learn to deliver the relevant products to the right customers,  at the right price and at the expected level of service.Managing Director of the corporation Mr Bode Opadokun, who disclosed this while  presenting his   score card to journalists after one year of his assumption of office, said the  corporation would continue to review its business process and models in order to build resilience and achieve the  goals.He said in order to achieve the above goals, the corporation would deploy fully functional, efficient and effective information communication technology (ICT) system in the development, distribution and sales of insurance products and services to all categories of farmers and other clientele in its insurance portfolio.Opadokun highlighted other future plans of NAIC to include:  providing insurance and other climate smart risk management services to the Nigerian farmers at a minimal costs and  using electronic platforms and products that will mitigate risks mostly attributable to climate change which may tend to weaken or impact negatively on the gains made in agriculture in Nigeria as well as to  implement underwriting of Weather Index Insurance in Nigeria with the support of donor agencies and international reinsurance organisations."We shall continue to cultivate and maintain strategic alliances with insurance brokers and underwriting firms for the marketing of our insurance products and services through their platforms and distribution channels", he stated.He also said the corporation will upgrade its offices in the commercial cities of Kano and Port Harcourt to control offices with a view to improving on its services and also harness the business opportunities in these cities and environs.The  NAIC  boss said "We will increase our share of the general insurance business market with a view to support the required growth of the corporation in terms  of size and activities. Increase the corporation’s premium income by 40 per cent  in the current year.He also said the agricultural services unit  of the corporation would be strengthened with well trained personnel and with the required working tool to assist farmers in increased food production.Speaking on the achievements of the corporation in the past one year, Opadokun said, "The corporation developed and commenced the implementation of a new strategic business plan that is woven around the core values of integrity, speed, motivation, innovation, leadership and excellent service.According to him, the essence of this new business plan is to re-position the corporation with a view to harness all the business opportunities that comes along with the on-going transformation agenda in the country, so that on the long run, the corporation remains the most preferred brand in the provision of Agricultural Insurance services in the country.He said within the period, the corporation  has engaged the services of a branding firm to conceptualise and design a new communication strategy for its operations, adding that the essence was to create the necessary awareness of its  products and services and ensure that it remains very visible in the consciousness of the various consumers of insurance products and services nationwide."Since last quarter of year 2014, we have embarked on various sensitisation and awareness drive among farmer groups and  cooperatives, independent systems analysts and ICT consultants were engaged to critically examine and review the business process of the corporation".He said based on their findings and recommendations, new insurance software was acquired which, according to him, is presently being deployed to facilitate turn- around time. .
The 1,000 permanent jobs promised by Center Parcs could cut 5pc off dole queues in the midland region, which includes counties Longford, Laois, Offaly and Westmeath.And, in terms of jobs per head of population, the employment boost for Longford is the equivalent of about 32,500 new jobs for Dublin.That demonstrates the potential impact of yesterday's jobs announcement.It's difficult to underestimate the potential boost the development will give to the region, which local businesspeople argue has been blighted by the recession and remains struggling to benefit from the much-vaunted economic recovery.The midlands has the highest unemployment rate of any region in the State, recording a rate of 13.1pc at the end of last year. That compares with a national average of 9.9pc.Despite claims that Ireland's economy is the fastest growing in Europe, locals in Longford argue businesses are still suffering and house prices remain among the lowest in the country.Local Sherry FitzGerald auctioneer Fintan McGill said the county, which has a population of 39,000, had been ravaged by the recession."We talk about these green shoots, but Longford has had lots of bad publicity," said McGill, who is also president of Longford Chamber of Commerce."Longford has been very badly hit. So this is absolutely unbelievable. I hope that it comes to fruition and it will be an absolute marvellous thing for the whole of the county. It is the first time we've had a bit of investment in the county for years."The number of people without a job in the midlands totalled 17,200 in the final three months of last year, according to the Central Statistics Office.Fianna Fáil councillor Seamus Butler, chairman of the county's economic strategic policy committee, said he hoped the development would mark a turning point in the economic fortunes of the region."Longford has been disproportionately hurt by the recession, in that there was a huge dependency - particularly among part-time farmers in the county - on the construction industry. We had chronic unemployment develop," Mr Butler says."We're hearing that Ireland is the fastest-growing economy in Europe. Longford is on a different planet."There has been absolutely no bounce here. There are still retail units closing and it's pretty grim at times. We're doing our best and this announcement is a huge fillip."Mr McGill said the economic stagnancy in the area was evident in the house prices. You can buy a three-bed semi-detached house in Longford for as low as €50,000."House prices here are slow to recover. The problem is we don't have the jobs here. And until that happens you're not going to see a rise in property prices," he said."They are rising, but at a slow pace, and it's coming from a very low base. Until we get people working, prices won't increase."
NEW Central Bank rules are more favourable to investors than to people hoping to buy a home, the banks have told a leading international credit ratings agency.The lending restrictions will push up rents, ratings agency Moody's said in a new report on Irish banks.The rules on deposits for those buying a home also put limits on the amount of income that can be used to calculate how much can be borrowed.However, they will also act to cool down the property market, as they will stop first-time buyers over-stretching themselves.It comes as a separate report from estate agency DNG shows property prices in Dublin rose by just 0.4pc in the first three months of this year.Moody's said it expects house prices to rise by between 5pc and 10pc this year, due to a stronger economy and the numbers of young people moving out from their parents' homes.The report is based on interaction between Moody's and the banks.Rents will be pushed up and young people will end up renting for longer."Lenders find the rules are more favourable for those buying properties with a view to renting them out," Moody's Gaby Trinkaus concluded.Under the restrictions that came in last February, most property buyers will have to have a deposit of at least 20pc of the value of the property.And buyers will be restricted to borrowing no more than three-and-a-half times their income. This will curb any bubble developing, the credit ratings agency said, after surveying seven mortgage lenders in this market.But first-time buyers are to lose out, it warned."Lenders consider that the higher deposit requirement will see first-time buyers renting for longer, and increase rents," the report says.This will be positive for landlords, as rising rents will mean buy-to-let investors will be able to keep paying their investment mortgages on time.But overall the mortgage lending restrictions will stabilise the property market in the long run, Ms Trinkaus wrote.Meanwhile, estate agency DNG said the lending limits and the end of tax relief for property investors meant there was a modest rise in property prices in the first three months of this year. Price rose by 0.4pc in the first three months of the year. On an annual basis, prices were up 14.4pc.The average price of a resale property in Dublin remained relatively unchanged in the quarter and now stands at €375,630, compared with €373,981 at the end of last year.House prices have now risen by 55pc since the 2012 low point, but still remain 47pc below their peak levels.DNG chief executive Keith Lowe said the Central Bank acted too quickly in bringing in the lending limits, as the market is not yet overheating.
The growing unease in Fine Gael over property tax has spread to rural constituencies, with a TD from the Taoiseach's home county calling for the charge to be linked to inflation.Mayo TD Michelle Mulherin put a motion before the Fine Gael parliamentary party proposing that future charges be linked to the average rate of inflation over three years, and based on the current self-assessment property taxes rates.The Fine Gael deputy insisted the property tax should only be changed every three years."There are fundamental problems with our property tax model, and I have been raising my concerns since before property tax was introduced," she said."The difficulty lies in the manner a property owner's liability is calculated, which is too simplistically linked with the market value of the property and affected by the often extreme fluctuations in the market, which we are witnessing now in some areas in particular."Her motion was not voted on, but Minister Noonan agreed to consider the proposal as part of a consultation process examining the property tax problem ahead of the next budget.Meanwhile, former Junior Minister and Dublin Central TD Joe Costello yesterday branded the controversial tax a "charge on Dubliners".Mr Costello also insisted all property tax collected in Dublin should be spent by local authorities in the capital and not used to make up funding shortfalls in rural county councils."We have to address what is being paid by people in Dublin."The way it is now it is not a property tax or a local tax it is a Dublin tax -and there are a lot of areas where people can't afford it."House values in Dublin intend to lead the way by a mile. It wasn't an issue when it was first introduced because property values were rock bottom, but now it's rapidly becoming a problem."
European Central Bank (ECB) policymakers agreed at their March meeting to "remain firm" in implementing a large-scale asset-purchase programme, even though the economic outlook shows signs of improving, records published yesterday showed.On March 5 the ECB said it would begin printing money to buy bonds - so-called quantitative easing (QE) - on the following Monday.It also presented updated forecasts from its staff economists yesterday that gave a more rosy outlook, but policymakers agreed that did not reduce the need for QE."The March 2015 projections should... not be interpreted as suggesting that the latest monetary policy measures were less necessary," the accounts of the meeting read."Hence, it was essential for the Governing Council to remain firm, implementing the measures adopted without hesitation until the objectives were reached, in line with its commitment to keep this policy in place for as long as needed," the accounts read.The ECB left its main interest rate at a record low just above zero at the off-base March meeting in Cyprus.It also lifted its growth forecast for the Eurozone economy to 1.5pc for this year, from the 1pc it predicted in December.ECB staff foresaw Eurozone inflation rising from 0pc this year to 1.8pc in 2017.The minutes of the meeting give a bare-bones account of the discussion, but they do provide a glimpse of the pressure and tension involved in ECB decision-making, which seeks to forge consensus among 19 different countries from Germany to Greece.Under its QE plan, the ECB aims to purchase €60bn a month of mainly sovereign bonds until September 2016, or beyond that if needed to see a sustained adjustment in the inflation path back towards its target of just under 2pc.Meanwhile, German regional development bank L-Bank has filed a suit at the European Court of Justice seeking to escape direct supervision by the European Central Bank, L-Bank said on Thursday.The ECB had placed the Landeskreditbank Baden- Wuerttemberg-Foederbank - which had assets of €70.7bn at the end of 2013 - on its list of 123 significant financial institutions that it started directly supervising in November.L-Bank said while it supported the goals of the ECB's supervisory mechanism, L-Bank itself conducted only low risk development lending and not the international and complex banking activity that was the main target of ECB supervision.L-Bank said the cost of ECB supervision will hurt its ability to provide low interest loans.
The boss of an island knitwear firm that counts Barney's in New York among its clients yesterday gave a cautious welcome to the Government extending State-subsidised air services to the Aran Islands by four years.Located on the smallest of the three Aran Islands, Inis Meáin, Inis Meáin Knitting employs 10pc of the 160-strong population.Founding managing director Tarlach de Blácam said the firm's business model would not work without air services."The air service is absolutely essential to what we do. I dread to think what would happen if we lost it," he saidMr de Blácam was speaking after the Department of Arts and Heritage threw the islands an economic lifeline by confirming that it is to provide a €3.6m subsidy - capped at €900,000 a year - to the air service over the four years and contract is due to commence in October. The capping of a €900,000 subsidy per year in the new contract is 29pc less than the current annual subvention of €1.27m.The new contract states that the maximum tourist airfare return is €60.50. Islanders pay €40.25 while under 18s and student islanders paying €27.60 return. Numbers using the service last year fell by 2,021 or 5pc to 38,473 - that includes 5,196 using the Inis Meain service. The proposed subsidy works out at €23 for every passenger.Mr de Blácam said that the perceived reduction in the air subsidy is a source of concern and requires clarification from the Department.Established in 1976, Inis Meáin sells high-end knit wear garments with men's sweaters starting at €250 each, rising to €500. The firm has stockists around the world. Accumulated profits rose by €102,117 to €170,475 in 2013. The firm's cash pile rose from €183,762 to €279,435.Mr de Blácam said "every penny is ploughed back into the business and over the last three years well over €250,000 has been spent on new technology at the firm". A spokeswoman for the Department of Arts and Heritage said it "is confident that an adequate service can be provided at the level outlined".
It has been a good week for rural Ireland. The announcement of up to 1,000 jobs in Longford yesterday came on the back of the ending of milk quotas in the dairy sector. There has been a feeling that rural Ireland has in many ways lost out on the bounce in our economic fortunes over the past 18 months.There is little doubt that the benefits of the recent upturn have been centred in Dublin and other cities. In contrast, the news from Longford and the dairy sector are very much stories based in rural Ireland. Any day that 750 construction jobs are announced for the midlands - with the possibility of up to 1,000 permanent positions at a later stage - has to be a good one.Center Parcs is an established tourist resort operator in Britain, with a number of very successful sites mainly in the midlands and south of England. Its entry into the Irish market will certainly provide local holiday and weekend-break options for Irish families.More importantly, it will give a serious boost to the tourism infrastructure of the midlands and will drive visitor numbers to what is a beautiful, but sometimes overlooked, region.The development is quite likely to drive further employment in the wider local economy. It is a similar tale with dairy expansion. It is envisaged that milk output will increase from 5.5 billion litres to close to 7.0 billion litres by 2020.This will not only drive exports nationally, it will also increase economic activity in every parish across the country. It is anticipated that up to 10,000 jobs will be created directly and indirectly, the vast majority of these being well away from the cities and towns which have attracted the bulk of the job announcements of late.Balanced economic development across the country is a goal that is never easily achieved. The reality is that modern hi-tech industries are rarely keen on setting up in rural locations.However, both the Center Parcs proposal and the dairy expansion show that economic development in a rural setting is possible where the initiatives are based on local, natural resources, such as the environment and agriculture.

Pre-tax losses at the Irish arm of the Dixon's retail operation rose by 19pc to €3.15m last year.Revenues at DSG Retail fell marginally from €152.38m to €150.5m in the 12 months to the end of April 30 last.According to the directors' report, "the results reflect the continued difficult economic environment in which the company continues to trade in".PC World and Currys also operate under the DSG banner in Ireland and the directors say revenues fell by 1pc, but that reflected a "strong performance in a very competitive and declining market".The directors say "post-tax losses worsened by €1m from €2.6m to €3.6m inclusive of a write-off of a deferred tax asset".In order to deliver an improvement in trading results, the directors say they continue to manage the cost base of the company and review regularly opportunities to drive efficiencies and savings.The numbers employed fell from 663 to 647 with staff costs falling from €15.98m to €15.6m.Emoluments for directors fell from €285,000 to €242,000.The losses include a non-cash depreciation charge of €3.1m.

Cherry was launching a line of Pet products at PetSmart. Craig Robertson/Toronto Sun/QMI AgencyDon Cherry at PetSmart with Best in Show winner Miss P for the launch of a line of pet products on Thursday, April 2, 2015. (Craig Robertson/Toronto Sun)It doesn’t happen often, but this was one room in which Don Cherry could not say he was top dog.Coach’s Corner may be TV’s best show but Miss P was “Best in Show.” They are both Canadians of high achievement.The two legends were together Thursday at the PetSmart at Laird and Eglinton in Leaside to celebrate the launch of a Simply Pets dog treat in support of the Don Cherry Pet Rescue Foundation.Grapes, along with his daughter Cindy and friend Bryan Green of Star Child Design, have started a line of pet products in which all of Cherry’s royalties will go to set up a foundation designed to rescue animals in peril.“It’s something I really wanted to do,” Cherry told me. “Any animal in danger is so upsetting. We want to help them.”On the packages of all of the treats are the pictures of actual rescue dogs and with Cindy Cherry, Don is also promoting the idea that people rescue animals who would normally be ruthlessly discarded.One of those is Sophie, a 15-month-old Cane Corso that was slated to be put to death.Rob Stevens and his family would have none of that.“Her eye had been ripped out and the breeder was going to put her down,” Stevens said. “I said no way.” Now Sophie is a big part of his family. Her life is amazing.“She is a happy dog,” he said.There is no difference between the importance and relevance of her life and that of Miss P (short for Peyton), who is not only a world champion beagle but also just won the Best in Show prize at the 139th competition of the Westminster Kennel Club at Madison Square Gardens in New York City in February.“I had to meet this dog. She is 100% Canadian,” said Cherry of the B.C.-bred beagle. “I had mentioned her on Coach’s Corner and then I just heard she was in Chicago at the game and received a standing ovation. It doesn’t get any bigger than that.”Miss P’s handler, Will Alexander, of Milton, said life is certainly different since the big victory.“It has been busy,” he said. “She knows about the attention and loves it. Everybody likes to be loved.” And everybody wants to get a picture with Miss P.The lineup was pretty long for Don Cherry too.“I am a big fan of Don’s,” said Greg Fernandes, who came along with his dog Teddi, a Coton de Tulear, wearing a Montreal Canadiens sweater.With the Habs taking away Cherry’s Stanley Cup dreams as a coach in the 1970s, normally that would be a fighting move, but Grapes has a soft heart for all who treat their dogs well.“Take the picture but I sure wish I had a Bruins sweater to get in this picture too,” Cherry teased.Grapes was happy to share the spotlight on this day with Miss P. We thought it would be cool to get the two of them together in a picture. Sun photographer Craig Robertson got the money shot.“What a beauty,” Don said of the champion hound. “They are all beauties.”He’s hoping his new foundation, found at DonCherrysPetRescue.org, will encourage more love of dogs, cats, birds, goldfish or hamsters, no matter if they’re first-round draft picks like Miss P or one that someone would actually consider killing like Sophie.As Don Cherry says, everybody is a top dog.
A British university student has been ordered out of Russia amid claims she is a spy.History postgraduate Laura Sumner, 24, was given ten days to leave the country after being fined £23.50 for an alleged visa violation.But Russian media reports have branded her ‘Agent Sumner’ and linked her to a bizarre claim of a revolutionary plot.A pro-Kremlin website claimed she was one of a number of students carrying out research in Russia by British historian, Professor Sarah Badcock.The report claimed the Nottingham University academic’s work was ‘important for the plans of the West to create a “colour revolution” in Russia’. The term describes the overthrow of governments in former Soviet states, such as the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine.Professor Badcock, 40, is supervising Miss Sumner’s PhD thesis on early Soviet Russia but there has been no suggestion outside Russian media that either woman is involved in espionage or plans to foment revolution.Questions have been raised over whether Miss Sumner has fallen victim to a tit-for-tat punishment by Russia.It came on the day that it emerged Britain had granted political asylum to a wealthy supporter of a prominent Russian opposition leader called Vladimir Ashurkov, who has been accused of embezzlement.And diplomatic relations have remained tense following Britain’s decision to launch a public inquiry into the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko in London. Action was taken against Miss Sumner by the Federal Migration Service but sources claimed officers from the FSB, the successor to the feared KGB, were in the courtroom.A migration service spokesman said the hearing on Wednesday April 1 in the city of Nizhny Novgorod was ‘not an April Fool joke’.Nottingham University said Miss Sumner appeared to have fallen foul of a ‘minor infringement in visa regulations’ but did not respond to the spying claims.She has been offered consular support by the British Embassy.Miss Sumner, from Solihull, describes herself as a feminist and dog lover on Twitter, and has been working on her thesis for more than a year.She has been to Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod at least twice to carry out research. She was unavailable for comment and her Twitter account had been deleted yesterday.Professor Badcock was also unavailable and was said to be on holiday with her family.
If anyone won this debate it was the women.Their less choreographed style of body language gave the impression we were listening to real messages from real people rather than watching spin doctors’ puppets performing.Overall I’m sure Miliband’s coaching team will be patting themselves on the back and declaring a win but his gesticulation and approach looked as manicured and choreographed as a Torville and Dean routine.He splayed his legs, he smiled on cue and when he swivelled his huge eyes direct to camera to repeatedly use the phrase ‘If I am prime minister’ it was like a hypnotist working his spell on his audience.Cameron kept a firm hand on the leadership rudder. He made no mistakes but there were no surprises either.Unlike Ed he appears fully formed rather than a body language work in progress but there were moments like when he pointed to each other leader in turn, taking them all down like skittles, that he might have scored a few more points than expected.Clegg is a good speaker but his performance was vintage, ie a complete re-run of his 2010 routine.He took enough pops at Cameron and waved his arm enough in that direction to signal an official end to the relationship that began in the Rose Garden but he looked more congruent agreeing with Cameron or fielding criticism as a double act than he did turning on him, which looked rather panto.For me Farage was diminished during this debate, perhaps the only casualty of the night, and it was the women who finally took him down with a few small swats.When Leanne told him he should be ashamed of himself he resorted to gurning to camera, looking like a naughty schoolboy being told off by a firm but kindly head.Nicola Sturgeon’s speech about ‘breaking up the old boys network’ finished off the coup and between Sturgeon, Wood and Bennett we got a glimpse of what political debate might be in the future without all the showboating, over-trained, incongruent performances.All three women seemed to talk impressively but relatively normally.Sturgeon was probably the best performer of the night, leaning one elbow on her lectern and looking the most confident of the entire group.But although Natalie Bennett feigned fiery but her breathless delivery and dodgy script-reading implied some levels of stage fright.Clegg and Farage did the best Tussaud's glassy stares, with Clegg quaffing water before the first insult had been thrown.Space and positioning defines power, meaning the line-up of the leaders is crucial in terms of creating the right kind of impact.Already buoyed up by his 'Cuthbertson fights back' appearance against Paxman, Miliband struck lucky with the middle spot (always where the highest status people sit) and used it to the max.His raised chin and benign smile suggested he was revelling in his new role as a bit of a bruiser and the smile became smugger and smugger during the debate, although his odd, erratic smiling and eye contact suggested he was being worked by some sort of remote control.Sturgeon is a smiling assassin, making her a tricky opponent for Cameron to stand next to.In his après-Paxman mode Cameron was looking serious and oozing leadership charisma, although the slight dab of sweat on his top lip suggested he felt under pressure.Farage on the other hand had a waxy glaze to his skin although he regained his usual bounce and emphatic gesticulation when taking questions from the audience.
It took just four gunmen to demonstrate Kenya's impotence against the Somali militant group Shabab.In an attack heavy with foreboding symbolism, Shabab massacred 147 college students, all or most of them Christians, in the eastern city of Garissa on the eve of Good Friday. At least 79 were injured, and the four gunmen were also killed.Survivors described their terror Thursday as gunmen searched dormitories, asking students whether they were Muslims and executing any Christians.Earlier in the day, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta downplayed the attack's severity, although it was known that hundreds were trapped, telling Kenyans that several were killed and wounded.Unconfirmed local news reports suggested some students at Garissa University College were beheaded, as furious critics railed at the failure of security forces to prevent mass terrorist attacks on civilians.Many said authorities should have boosted security at the campus, an obvious target with a mixed Muslim and Christian student body in northern Kenya, after specific intelligence warnings in recent days of an impending attack on a Kenyan university. Others bemoaned that a tragedy mirroring Shabab's 2013 attack at the Westgate mall in Nairobi, the capital, which killed 67, could have occurred, with even greater casualties.Survivors described how men with machine guns swiftly shot down the two police officers guarding the college before swooping into the campus, spraying bullets everywhere and taking control of one dormitory.The targeting of Christians, a classic Shabab tactic, is designed to ramp up tension between the nation's Muslim and Christian populations, helping it attract more recruits, analysts said.The attack also underscored the persistent failures of Kenya's security services: the corruption that allows Shahab fighters to easily penetrate the border and move around the country; the intelligence shortcomings; and the heavy-handed harassment of Kenya's Muslim population that drives alienated, jobless young men into the arms of extremists.More than 100 students were held hostage on the campus as the 15-hour siege dragged into the night. As darkness fell, a series of deafening explosions rang out, according to reports from the scene."The operation has ended successfully. Four terrorists have been killed," Interior Minister Joseph Nkaissery told reporters in Garissa. In the grisly finale, the gunmen, strapped with explosives, were blown up as Kenyan forces moved in, firing, he said.Shabab has suffered recent setbacks in Somalia, with the killings of its secretive commander, Ahmed Abdi Godane, and other top figures in U.S. drone attacks. But it remains capable of carrying out devastating attacks in Somalia and neighboring countries, often using just a few gunmen.The attack Thursday was its bloodiest, and the second deadliest in Kenya after the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombing in Nairobi.Ken Menkhaus, a Shahab and terrorism expert at Davidson College in North Carolina, said that though the group was growing weaker in Somalia, it was gaining strength in Kenya. He described the college attack as "tragic and predictable.""They have been looking at soft targets in northern Kenya where they can operate more easily than in Nairobi," he said. "It was a very easy target of opportunity for them that was going to have a very big impact on Kenyans."Officials said all students were accounted for. More than 800 were on campus during the attack; 587 fled or were rescued, a figure that apparently does not include the injured. Dozens of injured students were flown to Nairobi for treatment.Authorities named the commander behind the attack as a former schoolteacher, Mohammed Mohamud, an ethnic Somali who also goes by the names Dulyadin and Gamadheere and is a major Shabab figure from southern Somalia's Middle Juba region. The Kenyan Interior Ministry released a photograph of Mohamud and offered a reward of $220,000 for information leading to his arrest. Authorities placed a $55,000 bounty on his head in December.Claiming responsibility for the attack, Shabab said in a statement that the university was on Muslim land and was there to promulgate "missionary activities and to spread deviant ideology."Garissa is a nonsectarian, public institution that specializes in science and technology.The attack came less than a week after a similar Shabab attack on a hotel in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, killed 24 people. In an unusual departure from its focus on East Africa, Shabab also recently threatened an attack on an unspecified American mall.Kenya's government, desperate for a solution, any solution, to the country's security crisis, plans to build a wall on part of its 450-mile northern border with Somalia, said Issa Timamy, governor of Lamu state, the site of several deadly attacks in 2014. But critics said a wall wouldn't work, especially without an improvement in the training and quality of security personnel.Human rights groups have reported extrajudicial killings of suspects by security forces, including several clerics on Kenya's coast, and the arrests of hundreds of Somalis at a time.One leading Shabab expert, Stig Jarle Hansen, said that Kenyan police were so corrupt that it was easy for detained Shabab members to bribe officers to let them go, and that the border was so porous and poorly protected that Shabab could easily strike in Kenya.Shabab carried out numerous attacks near the border last year, including the massacres of 28 bus passengers and 36 quarry workers near Mandera, and the killings of more than 90 people in several attacks near Lamu on the coast."The border is totally leaky, partly because it's huge, but partly because of the level of corruption amongst the Kenyan border services," said Hansen, who has written a book about Shabab.He said that at times the statements of Kenyan politicians were obviously false. A recent Shabab video lampooned the president, Kenyatta, who insisted that last year's attacks on Mpeketoni, near Lamu, were by local political forces. The video showed Shabab forces in Mpeketoni, with Kenyatta behind them on television denying they were there."It was gift wrapping for Shabab. At times Shabab has been more correct in its information than the Kenyan government," Hansen said.He said the mass arrests and allegations of extrajudicial killings damage "the reputation of the Kenyan security services in the eyes of the people, who can become potential recruits. All these problems give Al Shabab a big operational advantage and a big propaganda advantage."Menkhaus said Shabab, allied with Al Qaeda, had been overshadowed in recent months by Islamic State, which has attracted thousands of foreign recruits.
Nathan Jones met Jerri Hewitt in 2005 at the Peninsula School in Mount Eliza. Nathan and his two brothers, Josh and Zak, had arrived at the school five years earlier on sporting scholarships, each of them with a bald head. Their father, Brad, had a shaved head; his three sons adopted the look. "They were these three bald sporty brothers," says Jerri.She has her own fashion label, Jerri Jones, and is a slim woman with an intelligent, generous manner. She and Nathan – or Nathe, as she calls him – didn't actually speak to one another until year 12. "From the moment we met, we did everything together," she says. "We're best friends."They married in 2012. They have a bonnie nine-month-old daughter called Bobbi who is loud and vigorous, clapping her hands together and making bubbly commentaries. Says her proud father in an amused way, "She beats up on the boys at Mother's group."Maybe it's fatherhood, maybe it's becoming the sole captain of the Melbourne Football Club, maybe it's winning his third club best and fairest in a row, but Nathan Jones has changed since I first met him. He's not as quiet, not as introvert. It's like someone has turned up his volume control.The first time we spoke he was happy to do the interview but you could hear him thinking during the pauses. There was a time, as he sees his career, when he "floated" as a footballer, when he stopped improving. He sees now that he was "over-thinking the game".He meditates now – a Paul Roos innovation – or gets into the boxing ring. He's more interested in "stories about sport than actually watching sport" and is enthusiastic about a series of documentaries he saw on boxers preparing for big fights. He has always used boxing as a way of preparing for matches, getting into the ring three or four days before each game "to get into the right mind-set".The first time we met I was astounded by the magnitude of his sporting ambition given that he was at Melbourne, a club that has known a lot of ignominious defeats while Jones has been there. I wrote: He feels each loss. "The first few days, it's almost like depression," says Jones. "You grieve, then by Thursday you twist your mentality around." Because every week he has to believe Melbourne can win."Sport has always been Nathe's thing," says his wife. "He still has dreams of being a pro surfer." When they met he was a state swimmer and a triathlete as well as a footballer. She used to get up early each morning to run him to teammate Travis Johnstone's so he could get a lift to training. She picked him up each night as well. She says she's not into football but she loves watching "Nathe and the boys" play; what she sees in her husband's game is how much effort he puts in.If ever a club needed and deserved a vote of confidence then Melbourne did when Nathan Jones signed on for another five years last December. The man who follows club legend Robert Flower in wearing number 2 is the pulse of the club. He says his drive has always been "internal". "I always wanted to be the best player I could be, to be one of the elite players in the competition." It was caretaker coach Neil Craig who encouraged him "to come out of myself and share my experience with the other players".He's now had lots of discussions with coach Paul Roos aimed at "aligning our expectations".  Roos got him to read how US basketballer Michael Jordan was persuaded that for him to be great he had to make his teammates great. He blushes slightly as he says it, adding, "I'm not making a comparison".The last time I wrote about Jones, his teammate Colin Garland said of him, "He might look like a tough boy from Frankston but he's quite spiritual in his thinking". Trust is a recurring word in his vocabulary. He'd been "sold a lot of hope at Melbourne over the years".  The many "hiccups", as he calls them, had shaken his trust in the club, but Roos persuaded him to open up and enter a dialogue. "I'd tell him anything now."When he signed on with the club for a further five years, the big discussion he wanted to have was about Roos' successor. At that stage, one hadn't been appointed. The club were open with him, he says, his concerns were met.Says Jerri,  "A lot of people said he should leave. Not many people in our generation, if they're not getting the result they want, would stay in that situation. But Nathe is naturally a very loyal person." He admits there were times when he was embarrassed by some of the Melbourne efforts he was involved in but says, "I'd ridden so much of the storm, I didn't want to jump ship now. I just want to see the club respected again."He is now in earnest discussions with Simon Goodwin, the man who will succeed Roos in 2017. Goodwin recently gave him an article on the relationship between New England Patriots coach Bill Belichik and star quarterback Tom Brady. "Brady's an arm of the coach."  Jones says Hawthorn's Luke Hodge plays like a coach. "He directs the play and, at the same time, leads by example." When the captain "plays like a coach", Jones says the coach – in Hodge's case, Alastair Clarkson - can concentrate on the tactical side of the game.I have been given a question to ask by a female Melbourne fan who goes most weeks to watch the Demons. How is it that when things are going bad for Melbourne, when the team has sunk to another low, he finds it in himself to respond? He has to think about that one. "My old man never pushed me but he always said good players stand up when it counts. When no one else can do it, I try and give a bit more. I see it as an opportunity."Nathan Jones is one of the purer sporting spirits I've encountered. He is mild in manner but his ambition surrounds him like an invisible force. Melbourne's had a lot of bad luck over the past decade. He's their good luck. There's something in him as large as the task facing the historic club.
LONDON - Liverpool visit Arsenal for a potentially definitive Premier League encounter this weekend, as the runners and riders in the race for Champions League qualification embark upon the season's final lap.Having had their 13-game unbeaten run ended by Manchester United before the international break, Liverpool find themselves five points below the Champions League spots with only eight games of the season remaining.Another defeat at the Emirates Stadium could see Liverpool cut adrift, but victory would take them to within three points of their opponents, revitalising their quest for a top-four finish."In terms of the objectives going into the game, it's no different to what it was before Manchester United, but of course we had a disappointing result and performance last time out," said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers."We really want to make sure we perform and give ourselves a chance to get a positive result."Arsenal are seeking to record a seventh league win in succession -- a feat they last achieved in March 2012 -- and with Manchester City not in action until Monday, victory would lift Arsene Wenger's side up to second place."It's a big game and an opportunity for us to continue our run, which is what we want to do," Wenger told his pre-match press conference."You know after the international break it's always important that you come back and straight away you are on it."Mathieu Debuchy, Mikel Arteta, Jack Wilshere and Abou Diaby are all back in training for Arsenal after injury, while Wenger said Danny Welbeck had a "little chance" of playing after hurting his knee on England duty.Daniel Sturridge and Adam Lallana could both feature for Liverpool despite withdrawing from the England squad through injury, but Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel are suspended.Raheem Sterling, meanwhile, is likely to find more than a few camera lenses trained on him after he confirmed that he has rejected a new contract offer and described reported interest from Arsenal as "flattering".United, a point behind Arsenal in fourth place, will also have designs on supplanting City ahead of a home game with relegation-threatened Aston Villa.Louis van Gaal's side appear to have clicked, belatedly, after stylish victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, but captain Wayne Rooney has warned that those wins will count for nought if they do not kick on.Asked if the 2-1 success at Anfield had been a six-pointer, the England skipper replied: "Yes it was, but that means nothing if we don't beat Aston Villa on Saturday."Obviously Arsenal play Liverpool as well, so if we can get the win against Villa, that will be an even better result than Liverpool was for us."Tottenham and Southampton, both six points below the top four, have opportunities to make up ground on at least one of the teams above them.Southampton travel to Everton on Saturday, while Spurs visit third-bottom Burnley the following day.Six points clear with a game in hand on all their pursuers, leaders Chelsea can take another step towards the title when they welcome Stoke City to Stamford Bridge.Jose Mourinho's side have stuttered in recent weeks, drawing successive home games against Burnley and Southampton, and midfielder Cesc Fabregas has urged his team-mates not to let their standards slip."Now we have to fight hard to win the Premier League and make this season a great year," said the Spaniard."We still have the chance to win the double (league and League Cup), and for that reason we cannot relax for a moment."Defending champions City travel to in-form Crystal Palace on Monday, by which time they could conceivably be in fourth place in the table and nine points below Chelsea.Bottom club Leicester City and second-bottom Queens Park Rangers are running out of time to close the gap on the teams above them, but third-bottom Burnley trail fourth-bottom Sunderland by a slender point.Sunderland host Newcastle United in the Tyne-Wear derby, where the visitors will be looking to halt a chastening run of four consecutive defeats against their local rivals.
MILAN - Rome will be on high alert on Saturday as Roma host Napoli for the first time since a supporter was killed last year in clashes between the teams' rival fans.The game has been scheduled for 1030 GMT (1230 local time) due to fears over fan violence.Last May, Napoli fan Ciro Esposito was shot and killed by a hardline Roma 'ultra' supporter on the fringes of the Italian Cup final.City officials have banned visiting Napoli fans from the game and ticket sales among the Roma supporters are not expected to soar either.But the match itself is crucial to both sides' Champions League qualification hopes.With Juventus boasting a 14-point lead over second-placed Roma, the Bianconeri look to already have a fourth consecutive scudetto sewn up.But the race to join them in the Champions League next season is far from over, and faltering Roma are the target for several hopefuls, including Napoli.A remarkable return of eight draws from a recent nine-game run effectively ended Roma's title hopes and left Rudi Garcia's men holding just a one-point lead over city rivals Lazio with 10 games remaining.Sampdoria sit in fourth, four points further adrift, with Napoli in fifth a further point off the pace.Roma finally got back to winning ways away to Cesena prior to the international break, but will be without injured striker Gervinho.Roma forward Adem Ljajic says beating Napoli is important to keep Lazio at bay."Saturday's game counts a lot for both sides, but we want to go out and play our game and try to win," Ljajic said."Lazio are a top side and are having a great run at the moment, but for now we're in second and we'll do everything to stay there."While victory has eluded Roma of late, Napoli have not exactly been blazing a trail, dropping five points behind Lazio after winning only one of their last six league games.An eventual slip-up by Roma could see high-flying Lazio, who are away at Cagliari, move up to second place, adding spice to the existing bitter rivalry between the capital clubs."Finishing second (behind Juve but above Roma) would be like winning the title for us," Lazio captain Stefano Mauri told Sky Sport. "In the city, people are really starting to feel the rivalry and our fans are desperate for us to go ahead of Roma."Fiorentina host Sampdoria in a clash that, while considered crucial for their respective European hopes, was already expected to serve up a cracking game between two attacking sides.Vincenzo Montella's men have lost only once in their last 11 league games but welcome Sinisa Mihajlovic's team with doubts over the availability of winger Manuel Pasqual and defender Stefan Savic.Sampdoria are looking for their fifth win on the trot and should be confident following a well-deserved home win over Inter Milan two weeks ago that left Mihajlovic purring."It was the best football we've played all season," said the Serbian.AC Milan's face a tough trip to Palermo as they chase a Europa League place, while city rivals Inter, a further point off the pace in 10th spot, host basement side Parma.Juventus, who have lost only once this season, are in action late Saturday when they host a tenacious Empoli side that is unbeaten in eight games.
Brisbane Roar are clearly ready to defend their A-League crown if a shock finals berth falls their way courtesy of Perth Glory's salary cap strife, according to coach Frans Thijssen.As the Glory prepare to answer to multiple allegations of serious cap breaches, the Roar showed the kind of damage they could inflict on their rivals with a 6-1 demolition of the hapless Central Coast Mariners on Thursday.Currently five points outside the top six, Brisbane's ladder position could be a moot point if Perth are found guilty and stripped of competition points as flagged by FFA earlier on Thursday.Thijssen wouldn't speak directly about Perth's predicament, saying the Roar can't afford to think about anything else but themselves - particularly with an AFC Champions League campaign on the side and a trip to South Korea looming next week.But he warned that if push comes to shove and they do Steven Bradbury their way into the finals, they won't be there to make up the numbers."We know we have a good team and if everybody's here we can beat anybody," Thijssen said."That's clear, I think, for everybody."The Glory have until April 8 to justify alleged payments to five players, including star striker Andy Keogh, who was reportedly paid $150,000 into a bank account held by a family member and not included as part of Perth's salary cap declarations.The scandal is manna from heaven for Brisbane, who appeared to be out of finals calculations after a run of five games without a win in all competitions - including four straight A-League losses.Thijssen said it wasn't the scent of new hope that spurred the Roar onto their crushing victory, rather the return of influential players such as Thomas Broich and Matt McKay.Broich laid on two assists in his comeback from an ankle injury while McKay, who has been on Socceroos duty, was an unused substitute."If you see the presence even on the bench and the dressing room with Thomas Broich and Matt McKay ... it's important," Thijssen said."It's good to see [Broich] back and get 45 minutes, everyone in the group sees that as very positive.But McKay's return presents Thijssen with another quandary - what to do with hat-trick hero Steven Lustica.The 23-year-old midfielder ran rings around the Mariners, scoring two stunning long-range strikes to make the most of a rare starting opportunity.Yet with McKay back, Broich fit and Luke Brattan cemented in his position, it's highly likely Lustica will drop to the bench for next week's AFC Champions League meeting with Suwon Samsung Bluewings."That's good. It gives me an extra choice, that's positive," Thijssen said.
HOUSTON - Scott Piercy matched a Houston Open record on Thursday, firing nine birdies in a nine-under-par 63 for the first-round lead in the US PGA Tour event.Piercy, looking for a victory that would give him a berth in next week's Masters, the first men's major of 2015, can only hope his form holds."It's the first round," said Piercy, who has struggled to get on track since elbow surgery sidelined him for much of last year."If I'm sitting here Sunday, then I'll be super-excited."Piercy's effort matched the 63s shot on the Golf Club of Houston Tournament Course by Australian Adam Scott and Americans Johnson Wagner, Phil Mickelson and Jimmy Walker.He had a two-stroke lead over Germany's Alex Cejka and American J.B. Holmes.Cejka had eight birdies in his seven-under round while Holmes eagled the par-four 10th to go with six birdies and a bogey.Mickelson, tuning up for a run at a fourth Masters title, headed a group on 66 that also included Charles Howell, Shawn Stefani and Luke Guthrie.Mickelson chipped in for birdie on his first hole, the par-four 10th, to set the tone for a round that included seven birdies.Even a closing bogey at the ninth didn't diminish his pleasure in the improvements he's seen in his short game thanks to some intensive practice in the wake of last week's equal 30th place finish in the Texas Open."I was able to turn that around in a few days and the game feels pretty good," said Mickelson, who won the Houston title in 2011.Mickelson’s Houston Open results haven't been much of a barometer for his success at Augusta National.He finished tied for 27th in 2011 at the Masters and won the Green Jacket in 2010 after tying for 35th in Houston.Even so, he'd be happy to go into Augusta playing good golf."This is a big week for me," Mickelson said. "I felt the game was close last week. The only thing missing was chipping and short game. If I can play well this week or continue on playing for the next three days, it should be some good momentum for next week."Mickelson is one of more than 30 players in the field who are Augusta-bound, and Piercy would like nothing more than to join them.He said a marathon practice session earlier this week had helped him solve a swing problem."In my 13th hour, something kind of clicked and I figured it out," Piercy said. "On Wednesday I kind of ingrained it, kept working on it. And today was awesome, it really was."Piercy had surgery on his right arm in February of 2014. He was injured for almost a year before having surgery."It’s been two years since I’ve really put a clubface on a ball like I know how, like I feel like I should," said Piercy, who won his two PGA Tour titles in 2011 and 2012.
Bishop of Kaduna Anglican Communion Bishop Josiah Idowu-Fearon, has been appointed as the next Secretary General of the Anglican Communion worldwide with effect from 1st July 2015.Idowu-Fearon’s appointment, which is the first in Africa, is for seven years in the first instance and renewable thereafter.He will oversee as Secretary General of 38 provinces and six extra provincial provinces and four instruments of the Anglican Communion.According to a copy of the notice of his appointment posted online and a hard copy obtained from him and as signed by Mr Tim Trimble, Director for Finance and Administration of the Anglican Communion Office, Bishop Idowu-Fearon was selected out of an initial field of applicants from Oceania, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas.Since 1998, Idowu-Fearon has been Bishop of Kaduna, and is the current Director of Kaduna Anglican Study centre. He served as Bishop of Sokoto, warden at Saint Francis of Assisi Theological College in Wusasa and provost of Saint Michael’s Cathedral in Kaduna.Responding to his appointment, Idowu-Fearon, who spoke to journalists at his Kaduna Bishop Court, expressed appreciation to God for his faithfulness.He said ”I am excited to take up the post of the Secretary of the Anglican Communion and to continue the fine work undertaken by Mt predecessors in the office.”
Chinese authorities have charged former domestic security chief Zhou Yongkang with bribery, abuse of power and intentional disclosure of state secrets, state news agency Xinhua said on Friday.Mr. Zhou’s case has been transferred to a court in the northern city of Tianjin, Xinhua said.Last year, China said it had arrested Mr. Zhou and expelled him from the ruling Communist Party, accusing him of crimes ranging from accepting bribes to leaking state secrets. It also said his case had been handed over to judicial authorities.Mr. Zhou is by far the highest-profile figure caught up in President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption. He is the most senior Chinese official to be ensnared in a graft scandal since the party swept to power in 1949.
TORONTO -- A bill that would ban therapy to 'convert' gay and transgender children and youth got support from MPPs of all political stripes in the Ontario legislature on Thursday.New Democrat Cheri DiNovo's bill would also prohibit OHIP coverage of conversion or reparative therapy for adults intended to change their sexual orientation or gender identity.Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans or questioning (LGBTQ) children and youth shouldn’t be told it would be better if they were “straight,” she said.DiNovo dedicated her bill to American transgender teen Leelah Alcorn, who committed suicide on Dec. 28 after undergoing conversion therapy. "Her final words were 'fix society please,'" DiNovo said, adding her bill was also dedicated "to all of those victims who've been electroshocked, shamed, suffered induced vomiting, induced paralysis, told they're not female or male enough to be female or male ... to those who've been told that snapping an elastic on their wrist every time they felt same-sex attraction was going to make them straight."Bill 77 passed second reading, 52-0, and now moves to a government committee for further examination.
The senator representing Niger East Senatorial District in Niger State, David Umaru, has denied the statement credited to the state governor, Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu, that he refused to pick the governor’s telephone calls.David Umaru in a statement yesterday in Minna, said the governor also claimed to have sent text messages to him which were not replied, and described the claims as false.He said, “Ordinarily, I would not have responded to these false claims knowing the pedigree of the person. However, I would want the public to note that Dr Muazu Babangida Aliyu’s claims are false and a mischief. I, therefore, urge the general public to disregard same”.“I must clarify that I do not have Dr Babangida Aliyu’s phone number and as such, I could not have shunned his calls. Equally, I have not received any text message from him.“However, I would like to reiterate the fact that I have since the announcement of the result of the polls extended hands of fellowship to all stakeholders in the zone (including Dr Babangida Aliyu) to work together for the development of Niger East and the state in general”.“I have also in the spirit of sportsmanship opened my doors to all those who were on the other side of the contest and I hereby repeat the same call. I would like Dr Babangida Aliyu to know that I understand how one feels when one is faced with this kind of situation. However, it is not necessary to personalise such issues since what has happened is an act of God”.

Market bets are mounting that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut the cash rate for the second time in two months at next Tuesday's board meeting.Having already eased for the first time in 18 months at February's meeting, the central bank's case for further monetary stimulus continues to grow, according to pricing in the interest rate futures market.By this measure, the chances of a second, 25 basis point reduction, to 2 per cent, are around 70 per cent, and the probability of one either happening by, or at, the May meeting fully priced in.Consumer and business confidence is flagging, the price of iron ore - Australia's single biggest export - has just hit a new six-year low below $US50 a tonne, the government has fiscal restraints and the RBA is concerned that the country's much-needed economic rebalancing away from resources-related infrastructure is too sluggish.Economists, however, are not convinced this is enough to force the bank's hand so soon after the start of easing: only seven of the 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the RBA to move next Tuesday rather than wait until May.Some argue that cutting rates again so soon will do nothing more than further inflate property prices in Sydney and Melbourne, or that monetary policy has now hit the limit of its own effectiveness in stimulating investment and growth in Australia. Also, they say the RBA wants more time to study developments in inflation and the jobs market before moving on rates again.According to the minority backing an April cut, however, the case is built on the following factors:A cut next week when May is still the economists' favourite would trigger an immediate sharp fall in the Australia dollar, which would further assist exporters and import-exposed industries.The RBA might be inclined to keep space between its next rate decision and the delivery of Treasurer Joe Hockey's second budget on May 12. As no-one thinks the bank will wait until after the budget is handed down, April is the only option.Although some segments of the market in Sydney and Melbourne are frothy, recent RBA data suggests that growth in lending to buy-to-sell and buy-to-let investors has peaked. Regulators are also monitoring lending to investors.The language used in the minutes of the last RBA policy meeting - when the cash rate was held at 2.25 per cent - pointed to an April cut, according to central bank-watchers. They say "further easing over the period ahead may be appropriate" is code for "we will cut rates again next month".If, as some economists are starting to suggest, the RBA sees the need for a cash rate below 2 per cent, it should move quickly. A reduction now will make it easier to cut again before the economy deteriorates further.
Past the broken bottles and still-wet vomit left behind after a wild, pre-long-weekend night in Melbourne's CBD, they marched.There were 4000, perhaps 5000, moving as one, singing softly and stepping quietly.With the morning sun high over Good Friday, worshippers from 18 churches - covering 10 Christian denominations - gathered at St Francis' Church in Lonsdale Street for the 15th Way of the Cross procession. The annual pilgrimage organised by Melbourne City Churches in Action passes from church to church around the city, with readings, prayers and hymns recreating Jesus' journey from the Last Supper to crucifixion and resurrection.Earlier, a few stalwart revellers had nursed their emerging hangovers over coffees and cigarettes. But by 10am, with most retail shops and cafes closed and revellers gone home, the city was all but empty, giving the march an other-worldly feel.Outside St Francis' Church, thousands streamed past Lawrence, a young rough sleeper who regularly claims a spot outside the church. None of the faithful gave him money, he said. But Melbourne City Mission chief executive and Melbourne City Churches in Action convenor, the Reverend Rick Holland, said the church regularly helped the young man and other homeless people in the city and beyond.Mr Holland said the Good Friday march was a unifying experience for Christians from all denominations."On Sunday they're all in their own little cubicles doing their own thing. But today we're together - 98 per cent of all churches agree on the main stuff. The differences are tiny."As the march passed different churches, up to 100 worshippers streamed out of each one, joining the march.Tony, a member of the Melbourne Welsh Church, joined the pilgrimage after hearing about it at service."The meaning of Good Friday is that Jesus gave his life for us and took the ultimate pain, which we couldn't bear," he said. "So it's about honouring that and mourning that, knowing that in three days' time we'll be rejoicing."Philippines native Ralito, a Roman Catholic, said religion had given him an immediate community when he migrated to Australia. And in the Good Friday march, he said, he had found a community of Christians from different traditions to his own.Harold, a member of the Uniting Church, said he had been attending Way of the Cross marches for five years with his wife."Here, we see a great example of love and compassion," he said. "It's bringing all these people together in a purpose that's bigger than any of us."
Market bets are mounting that the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut the cash rate for the second time in two months at next Tuesday's board meeting.Having already eased for the first time in 18 months at February's meeting, the central bank's case for further monetary stimulus continues to grow, according to pricing in the interest rate futures market.By this measure, the chances of a second, 25 basis point reduction, to 2 per cent, are around 70 per cent, and the probability of one either happening by, or at, the May meeting fully priced in.Consumer and business confidence is flagging, the price of iron ore - Australia's single biggest export - has just hit a new six-year low below $US50 a tonne, the government has fiscal restraints and the RBA is concerned that the country's much-needed economic rebalancing away from resources-related infrastructure is too sluggish.Economists, however, are not convinced this is enough to force the bank's hand so soon after the start of easing: only seven of the 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect the RBA to move next Tuesday rather than wait until May.Some argue that cutting rates again so soon will do nothing more than further inflate property prices in Sydney and Melbourne, or that monetary policy has now hit the limit of its own effectiveness in stimulating investment and growth in Australia. Also, they say the RBA wants more time to study developments in inflation and the jobs market before moving on rates again.According to the minority backing an April cut, however, the case is built on the following factors:A cut next week when May is still the economists' favourite would trigger an immediate sharp fall in the Australia dollar, which would further assist exporters and import-exposed industries.The RBA might be inclined to keep space between its next rate decision and the delivery of Treasurer Joe Hockey's second budget on May 12. As no-one thinks the bank will wait until after the budget is handed down, April is the only option.Although some segments of the market in Sydney and Melbourne are frothy, recent RBA data suggests that growth in lending to buy-to-sell and buy-to-let investors has peaked. Regulators are also monitoring lending to investors.The language used in the minutes of the last RBA policy meeting - when the cash rate was held at 2.25 per cent - pointed to an April cut, according to central bank-watchers. They say "further easing over the period ahead may be appropriate" is code for "we will cut rates again next month".If, as some economists are starting to suggest, the RBA sees the need for a cash rate below 2 per cent, it should move quickly. A reduction now will make it easier to cut again before the economy deteriorates further.
The elders and youths of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Benue South senatorial district have congratulated the president-elect Gen Muhammadu Buhari, for a well-deserved victory.This is just as Gov Gabriel Suswam saluted General Buhari for his emergence at the polls, which he said was the will of God to ensure that peace endures in the country as against the predictions of doom by scaremongers.This was contained in a statement signed by the governor’s media director, James Uloko.The APC elders further stated that the presidential and parliamentary elections marked a watershed in the quest for a credible, free and fair election to effect a change for a more progressive leadership.Speaking to newsmen on behalf of the elders in Otukpo town of the state, Mr Adoi Ojogbane noted that “using the ballot paper, the most potent ingredient of democracy, the people of Benue South Senatorial Zone have shown a commendable determination to register their votes and the choice of credible leaders that would pilot the affairs of this great nation, Nigeria to greater heights for the next four years.”The elders, however, condemned in strong terms the alleged coercion, inducement of electoral officials and falsification of election results, adding that they have totally rejected the election results as announced by INEC in the Benue South senatorial zone.Describing the election of Buhari as timely, the opposition elders insisted that the administration of Goodluck Jonathan failed to tackle the enormous security and economic challenges, as well as massive corruption which they said caused serious underdevelopment.
A man has died after falling from a balcony in Byron Bay, the second person killed in a balcony fall in NSW on the same day.The 69-year-old man fell from the second-floor balcony of an apartment on Lighthouse Road about 4pm on Thursday, police said.Paramedics treated him at the scene before taking him to Byron District Hospital, where he died later.A NSW Police spokeswoman said police believed the man fell from the balcony as a result of "misadventure", rather than due to any structural problems with the balcony.However, no further details were immediately available about how the man fell.His death occurred on the same day that Pankaj Saw, 29, an IT analyst, plunged to his death from the third-floor balcony of an apartment in Macquarie Park in Sydney's north-west.Mr Saw, an Indian national living and working in Sydney, had been on the phone to his wife in India when he fell about 10 metres to the ground about 1am on Thursday. A smashed cordless phone was found next to his body.Initial investigations into Mr Saw's death suggest a wooden railing on the balcony collapsed and Mr Saw fell over the edge. He died just months after marrying in India, and his wife was due to join him in Australia this year.Police are preparing reports for the coroner in relation to both deaths.
Pope Francis visited the Roman prison of Rebibbia on Thursday, moving many of the male and female inmates to tears with his simple words reminiscent of those spoken by Pope John XXIII, years before at the Regina Coeli: “Can a mother forget the baby at her breast? Though she may forget, I will not forget you,” citing a passage from God’s conversation with Prophet Isaiah.These words conveyed a basic tenet of Christianity to the 300 inmates gathered within the prison’s church that the Lord’s love and forgiveness are unconditional.The Pope then washed the feet of 12 inmates, six men and six women, one of whom was a Nigerian mother carrying out her sentence in the creche; Pope Francis washed and kissed the feet of the baby she held in her arms. Half of those present were foreigners, reflecting the reality of the current prison system.“All of you, all of those who live here, are brothers and sisters,” His Holiness said.“I also need to be washed. Let the Lord wash the dirt from me too, so that I may become more a slave, a slave to you, to be of greater service to the people, as Jesus was.”He explained further, “In Jesus’ times, when people arrived at home, their feet were always dusty from their travels, the roads weren’t paved back then.Their feet needed to be washed, but the slaves did it, not the masters. And Jesus washes our feet like a slave, the feet of his disciples, stating: ‘what I am doing you do not understand now, but afterward you will understand’.He made himself a slave to serve us, cure us, cleanse us. Today, in this Mass, the Church wants the priest to wash the feet of 12 faithfuls, like the 12 apostles.But in our hearts we must be sure and have the conviction that when the Lord washes our feet He washes everything, He purifies us, makes us feel His love.” Pope Francis also dedicated the Thursday morning homily at St.Peter’s to his fatigued priests.“Do you know how often I think about it, about how tired you all are?
Two guys in a grey van are suspected of breaking into April Wyatt's car and taking her bag while her car was parked at The Minden lookout on Wednesday afternoon.The 26-year-old solo mum doesn't care about the bag, but is desperate to get back two camera memory cards containing precious pictures of her son and daughter.April, her two sisters and her daughter went to the lookout at about 1pm and returned about 15 minutes later to find the back window of her car smashed and her bag missing.“I saw my smokes had been taken, then I realised my bag had gone, which has my camera and my two memory cards full of pictures of my kids in,” says April.“I really want to get them back if I could. They mean everything to me. There's one memory card in the camera and one in the pocket of my bag. I don't care about my camera or anything.“They could drop the cards off somewhere or post them somewhere, or give them to someone who could take them to the police station.”While they were on the lookout, another woman who arrived told April there was a grey van with two guys in it parked next to April's car.“When she told me I thought, ‘that's so suss'. Whether they had done it before she got there or they had done it after she started going up the track.“My back window was smashed. There was glass through the back seat and my daughter's car seat there was glass throughout the car. I've got no window on my son's side till I can afford one.“I was pretty horrified when it happened because it's not something I need right now.”People with information about the break in are asked to contact their nearest police station.Alternatively, information can be left anonymously via the Crimestoppers 0800 555 111 line.
The Chairman, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, Ilorin District, Mr. Suleiman Ishola, has called for regular training of teachers, saying it is an elixir for improving the quality of education in the country.The measure, he said, would also help to reduce mass failure in external examinations, such as the West African Senior School Certificate Examination and National Examinations Council.He spoke in Ilorin on Thursday at an education programme organised by ICAN in the district. The programme entitled, “catch them young,” attracted pupils from many schools in Kwara State.Ishola, who said the initiative was to exposure pupils early to the rudiments of accountancy, added that failure in external examinations was inimical to societal advancement.According to him, early accountancy education will help prepare pupils for challenges of the 21st century.The branch, he added, through the programme, would organise quiz and other academic competitions to identify brilliant pupils to offer scholarships.Ishola said, “The performance of pupils is going down nearly in all the subjects. We want a situation where people at the helms of affairs at our education ministries will make it imperative for pupils to able to learn. There should be continuous training not only for the pupils but also for the teachers, who will impart the knowledge. Many things are currently wrong, but with time, we will be able to surmount them.“The government should ensure that the teachers are well trained so that they can impart this knowledge. They should ensure that there is good learning environment for pupils. There should also be discipline even among pupils so that they can sit down and read.”Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

A group of individuals working on a set of initiatives to improve the quality of education in the country has launched a new survey programme that will give citizens an opportunity to assess educational projects.According to the promoters, the community-based survey and evaluation will drive the programme, called LEARNigeria.The inauguration of the initiatives via the Nigerian Education Summit took place in Ikoyi, Lagos.The Chairman, Nigeria Economic Summit Group, Mr. Foluso Philips, who addressed the participants, said the county needed to take urgent steps to salvage the future of education.According to him, the country cannot continue to ignore the dwindling state of its education.Philips said, “Roughly 10.5 million children are out of school; roughly one in five children are Nigerians; in the past six years, 70 per cent of secondary school leavers fail the West African Senior Secondary Certificate Examinations, meaning that those in schools are not learning much. These are statistics that should bother us.”The assessment programme, he said, was among the key issues agreed on at last year’s Nigeria Economic Summit, which focused on education.The education sector, he added, was too important to be in the hands of government alone.He, therefore, called on the private sector and individuals to take active interest in the performance of the sector and to contribute to its revival.Philips added, “The NES established the fact that education is central to transforming Nigeria into one of the most competitive economies in the world in the 21st century. It concluded that Nigeria deserves an education system that is vision-driven, fit-for-purpose and led by competent professionals. Also, the delegates discussed, debated and established eight critical components central to the transformation of Nigeria’s education system.”He said the adopt-a-school initiative for which corporate foundations, such as Oando Plc and MTN have shown remarkable leadership, was among the recommendations made at the summit.Philips, who said LEARNigeria would mobilise volunteers to assess education projects in the country, added that he was confident that the initiative would improve outcome of education budgets.Copyright PUNCH.

An aide to the Bayelsa State Governor, Hon. Seriake Dickson, on Youths Matters, Hon. Torukori Egei and two others yesterday escaped being killed by armed Policemen along the Kaima bridge of Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area of the State over alleged traffic issues.The Policemen, according to eyewitnesses, were security details attached to a Port Harcourt based Businessman from the State, Gesie Asamowei.Leadership gathered yesterday that the attacked Dickson’s aide, was allegedly assaulted alongside Mr. Aveke Dominion and a musical artiste, Mr. Asu Douye, popularly known as Jeffiraimo.The incident, which occurred on the 14th of March at about 3:20pm, has been reported at the Kaima Police Division and a case of aggravated assault and attempted murder has been filed against the three Policemen and their principal, Gesie Asamowei.A Youth group, known as the Bayelsa Youth Integrity and Conscience Group (BYICG) and International Moral Justification Forum (IMJF), while confirming the incident yesterday protested the alleged assault and attempted murder of the Senior Special Assistant on Youths in Bayelsa State, Mr Torukori Egei.The youths, in a statement signed by their Chairman, BYICG, Mr Victor Woyinkuro and Secretary, Mr Samson Kikile, accused one Gesie Asamaowei of leading the attack on Egei and his friends.They said security operatives attached to Asamowei brutalised the victims at Kiama bridge in Kolokuma-Opokuma,”Egei and his friends were coming from a wedding ceremony of their friend, Jerry in Ole, Delta State, to Yenagoa, when their vehicles were overtaken on the bridge by the said persons. Before they could realise it, their vehicles were smashed and seriously damaged with guns. A tear gas canister was also thrown at them and their heads were stamped on the ground”The group said the matter would be taken to court and appealed to the judiciary to ensure that justice was done on the case.” The judiciary is known as the last hope of the masses. But if nothing is done, we, the youths, will take the matter further. We, the youths of the Niger Delta are calling on the law enforcement agency to arrest every unauthorized individual trying to cause havoc and accidents on our Federal High way”.
The film begins with a slow pan of a city, a hectic metropolis indistinguishable from its brethren around the world. But then the camera picks up a multi-spired building, a one-of-a-kind structure that tells us immediately where we are. The building is Barcelona's La Sagrada Familia, a cathedral once seen, never forgotten.La Sagrada's architect, the visionary Antonio Gaudí, has been the subject of documentary films before (most notably 1984's "Antonio Gaudí" by Japanese director Hiroshi Teshigahara). But this film is the first to concentrate on Gaudí's masterpiece, still unfinished after more than 125 years of construction.Directed by Switzerland's Stefan Haupt in a deliberate, unforced manner, "Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation" takes a satisfying three-pronged approach to this unique structure: visual, historical and reportorial. (Haupt's idea of having a symbolic figure appear from time to time on screen is more confusing than satisfying, but fortunately the appearances are brief and infrequent.)La Sagrada is always going to be a spectacular building, but cinematographer Patrick Lindenmaier does an especially fine job of showing us the play of light in the cathedral's enveloping interiors.The history of La Sagrada, related by narrator Hanspeter Müller-Drossaart and various interview subjects, is a complicated one.The building's foundation stone was laid in 1882, and Gaudí, something of a mystic as well as an architect, took over soon after. "A Catalan through and through" and someone who believed "only God creates," he was inspired in part, as footage reveals, by the mountainous setting of the monastery of Montserrat, a Catalan holy place.Funds for the cathedral were always lacking, and Gaudí himself would often go begging door to door in Barcelona for money. In fact, when he was fatally hit by a streetcar in 1926, he was so poorly dressed he was taken to a hospital for the poor and homeless.Things got even worse for La Sagrada during the Spanish Civil War, when almost all of Gaudí's plans were burned and his plaster models smashed in an excess of anti-clerical zeal.But the remarkable thing about this building is that no one gave up on it, ever. As one of today's workers puts it, "We are Catalan. We owe it to him to finish this temple and show his genius to the world."It is these interviews with the people who are working on the building in the here and now that are the most involving parts of "Sagrada." Almost to a person, from architect Jordi Bonet, the third generation of his family to be involved, to ordinary workers, everyone feels part of a spiritual cause, not a construction project.Perhaps the film's most compelling interviewee is Japanese sculptor Etsuro Sotoo, at work for more than 30 years. When he started, he was a committed Zen Buddhist, but he converted to Catholicism to better understand the wellsprings of Gaudí's vision and is now part of a movement petitioning to have the architect declared a saint. Such is La Sagrada's power.Though it is now one of Barcelona's top tourist attractions, the structure continues to face obstacles, including a high-speed subway train whose tunnel is scheduled to run directly below the building, leading to the threat of vibrations that could damage the cathedral.That many of the people involved with La Sagrada will not live to see it finished seems to bother no one. "God is not in a hurry," is how one person puts it. "The important thing is not finishing it, but building it."Playing: Laemmle Playhouse 7, Pasadena.

A sea change has brought visions of serpents and giant sharks, let alone monster rodents that go bump in the night.I've made a sea change. Not only the Sigrid Thornton-style Sea Change of moving to the NSW south coast, but I've changed the way I look at the sea.I can tell you the exact date it happened: January 7, 2015. I was camping down the coast and went into a cafe to order a coffee. While waiting, I broke my "no newspapers, only books" rule for holiday reading and flicked through a copy of the Herald. It was a mistake.The headline that jumped out was: "Brown snake swims between the flags at Forster." As if we lovers of Australian beaches don't have enough to contend with: sharks, stingrays, bluebottles, deadly jellyfish, now snakes as well. It was the only story (sorry, colleagues) I read in full and the one that haunted me for the rest of the holiday. At the best of times I don't sleep well in a tent, but my fitful slumber was filled with nightmares of little snakes in speedos and lifesaver caps swimming in the sea.As an ocean swimmer, I've come to a gentle peace about my fear of sharks. It's a kind of "don't go into the kitchen if you can't stand the heat argument". If I go into their territory – the ocean – I've got to expect there's a possibility I could be attacked. I guess, rather naively I hadn't included snakes in my list of things to fear about the ocean; but a sea full of snakes is like my room 101. A fellow herpetologically challenged colleague assured me sea snakes, although venomous, usually don't have a big enough jaw to bite humans so instead pick on others their own size. Which, until now, has given me some relief. So serpents were never something I angsted about in the sea.So you can imagine my trepidation when I went to the beach last month near my son's new school and was greeted with two signs: Beware of snakes, and beware a large shark that had been sighted offshore.All we need to add was beware crocodiles and box jellyfish and you'd have nearly every cliche of Australian life rolled into one.It wasn't the shark sign that scared me. I'd had the tip-off about the huge white pointer before I'd seen the sign from the local swimming group (word passes quickly about such sightings).The surf club swimmers told me they first saw the dorsal fin just as a PE class from my son's school was emerging from the water. I certainly had the scoop long before it made the front page of the local paper, along with tiger and grey nurse spottings.If that had been Sydney, we'd have had it on our website within hours I'm sure, but out here in the bush and the more rugged coast, people are more accepting that wild things lurk in their natural habitat, unlike us scaredy pants Sydneysiders.But the "beware snakes" sign horrified me; in the way the Forster 1.5-metre brown snake must have frightened swimmers out of the sea when the surf lifesaver's whistle blew back in January.There have been more sightings there, too, of hungry brown snakes, if you haven't been following the saga in the Great Lakes Advocate, as closely as I have. Snakes in the sea, how can that be? I know it sounds like a Dr Seuss rhyme, but that's the question that rolls in my mind now I am brave enough to swim in the outside Sydney sea.When I tell non-city folk they roll their eyes at my tales of complaining about the size of the dead rodents our cat drags in from a night hunting (nearly as big as the feline herself – almost the size of a small marsupial, perhaps even a bilby, so if the Easter bilby doesn't visit this year, we'll know why.) She, of course, must come and meow with her catch about 3am; all I know is the things that go bump in the night here are much bigger than they are in the city.And I can't look at the ocean any more, without thinking it's a vipers' nest.
Twelve southeast Queensland dams are overflowing and might pose a threat to people living downstream.Dam operator Seqwater said: "This means that if you are downstream of the dam you should exercise caution near waterways and floodplains as you may encounter fast-flowing or deep water that could be a safety hazard."After several days of heavy rain, the Borumba, Cedar Pocket, Enoggera, Ewen Maddock, Gold Creek, Lake Macdonald, Lake Manchester, Leslie Harrison, Little Nerang, Maroon, Sideling Creek and Wappa dams are spilling.More than 150mm of rain has been dumped on parts of the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast hinterlands in the past 24 hours. Falls have been less in Brisbane, which recorded 30-50mm of rain.The Bureau of Meteorology says more rain is expected during the next couple of days.
There's one economy that's not affected by any of the capitalist activities and that's North Korea. Or is it?The BBC's Korea correspondent, Steve Evans, has been talking to people who do business there and discovered that there's a lot more capitalism than you might think.
PARIS - Two-time defending champions Toulon welcome back veterans Bakkies Botha and Matt Giteau for a European Champions Cup quarter-final against Wasps this weekend, the latest step in their bid for an unprecedented third consecutive continental title.Ex-Springbok enforcer Botha returns after recovering from a broken finger while former Wallaby playmaker Giteau will likely start on the bench in his comeback from a groin operation.Two big names that coach Bernard Laporte will be happy to see back after an untimely 34-24 defeat by Toulouse in Top 14 action last weekend.Laporte was left seething after that loss, but also insisted he would put it to good effect."Anger is always tough to digest, but it lessens as you ready for the next game," Laporte said ahead of Sunday's match."I don't accept losing. It's surely a failure of mine, but it grinds me down and eats me up until the next training session."Laporte added: "It also helps get everyone motivated again, although I know we won't win that Toulouse game."We have to focus solely on the match against Wasps, which looks like a tough one and one which we'll have to handle well."We want to be European champions again..."Wasps coach Dai Young said Toulouse had not done his side any favours by pulling off a victory over the Top 14 champions."I must admit that I would rather have seen them win comfortably last weekend, than lose," the former Wales and British Lions prop said."They are going to be wound up this week and Toulouse certainly didn't do us any favours because they will come into this game having taken a few boots up their backsides."Toulon are locked at the Top 14 summit with Clermont, who host runaway English Premiership leaders Northampton on Saturday.Northampton and Wasps are two of four English clubs in the quarters (and all playing away), along with last season's beaten finalists Saracens and Bath, sat second and third in the league.Northampton will be without Wales winger George North, who suffered his third concussion in eight weeks in league action last weekend.And with the record books showing that in 72 quarter-final encounters in Europe's top flight, 54 have been won by the home club -- a 75 percent success rate for those sides on home soil -- Northampton know they will be up against it in Clermont.The last time the French club lost at home in Europe was against Sale in the 2008/09 season. Since then Clermont have won 22 home fixtures in the European Cup."We've got to stop Clermont from getting momentum because if they get over the gainline consistently early on, you've not got a chance. Our defence is going to be paramount to stopping them," Saints lock Courtney Lawes told Sky Sports."Clermont are a fantastic team and are capable of beating anyone, but so are we -- I think we've got as good a chance as anyone. If we go out there and play like we know we can, we've got a good chance of sneaking a win."Racing, the only unbeaten club in the competition's pool stages, are also at home against Saracens and will look to Ireland fly-half Jonathan Sexton pull the strings in the outskirts of Paris.Sexton's club from next season, Leinster, host Bath in their bid to progress towards a fourth European title.
Capping exhausting and contentious talks, Iran and world powers have sealed a breakthrough agreement outlining limits on Iran’s nuclear program to keep it from being able to produce atomic weapons.The Islamic Republic was promised an end to years of crippling economic sanctions, but only if negotiators transform the plan that was announced Thursday into a comprehensive pact.They will try to do that in the next three months.The United States and Iran, long-time adversaries who hashed out much of the agreement, each hailed the efforts of their diplomats over days of sleepless nights in Switzerland. Speaking at the White House, US President Barack Obama called it a “good deal” that would address concerns about Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif called it a “win-win outcome.”Those involved have spent 18 months in broader negotiations that were extended twice since an interim accord was reached shortly after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani entered office. That deal itself was the product of more than a year of secret negotiations between the Obama administration and Iran, a country the US still considers the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism.Opponents of the emerging accord, including Israel and Republican leaders in the US Congress, reacted with scepticism. They criticised the outline for failing to do enough to curb Iran’s potential to produce nuclear weapons or to mandate intrusive enough inspections. Obama disagreed.“This framework would cut off every pathway that Iran could take to develop a nuclear weapon,” he declared. “This deal is not based on trust. It’s based on unprecedented verification.”If implemented, the understandings reached Thursday would mark the first time in more than a decade of diplomatic efforts that Iran’s nuclear efforts would be rolled back.It commits Tehran to significant cuts in centrifuges, the machines that can spin uranium gas to levels used in nuclear warheads. Of the nearly 20,000 centrifuges Iran now has installed or running at its main enrichment site, the country would be allowed to operate just over 5,000. Much of its enriched stockpiles would be neutralised. A planned reactor would be reconstructed so it produced no weapons-grade plutonium. Monitoring and inspections by the UN nuclear agency would be enhanced.America’s negotiating partners in Europe strongly backed the result. President Francois Hollande of France, which had pushed the US for a tougher stance, endorsed the accord while warning that “sanctions lifted can be re-established if the agreement is not applied.”Obama sought to frame the deal as a salve that reduces the chances of the combustible Middle East becoming even more unstable with the introduction of a nuclear-armed Iran. Many fear that would spark an arms race that could spiral out of control in a region rife with sectarian rivalry, terrorist threats and weak or failed states.Obama said he had spoken with Saudi Arabia’s King Salman and that he’d invite him and other Arab leaders to Camp David this spring to discuss security strategy. The Sunni majority Saudis have made veiled threats about creating their own nuclear program to counter Shia-led Iran.The American leader also spoke by telephone with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, perhaps the sharpest critic of the diplomacy with Iran. Netanyahu told Obama a deal based on the agreement “would threaten the survival of Israel.”The White House said Obama assured Netanyahu that the agreement would not diminish US concerns about Iran’s sponsorship of terrorism and threats toward Israel.Obama saved his sharpest words for members of Congress who have threatened to either try to kill the agreement or approve new sanctions against Iran. Appearing in the Rose Garden, Obama said the issues at stake are “bigger than politics.”“These are matters of war and peace,” he said, and if Congress kills the agreement “international unity will collapse, and the path to conflict will widen.”
